They tell lies about who said what to whom, about who makes love to whomever, and so on. They do this continually, and what is more, they are at pains to act out the lies told by others, especially when they are elegant, so they might make them true. And so it goes from tongue to lip to tongue, until no distinction remains between what is a lie and what is true.

The first chapter's brutal generalisations feel like something from the 1930s - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Benedict"">Ruth Benedict</a> shit. <br/><blockquote><i>Because of the risks involved in defining oneself, most important academic treatises about Mexico have been written by foreigners...<br/><br/>In its soul, Mexico is not—and perhaps never will be — a Western nation. But by trying to make the country more superficially democratic, more Western, more “presentable” abroad, the system’s roots in the population have weakened. It has become less truly democratic because it is less representative of real Mexicans. The more the system responds to the Americanized minority, the more blatant will be the contradictions within the country...<br/><br/>more evident than in Mexico’s almost aggressive sense of nationalism. The threats, attacks, invasions and occupations that have come from abroad since the time of Independence are more than sufficient to justify Mexico’s unspoken xenophobia... Feeling imprisoned historically and economically by the United States, Mexico has used a series of lesser political issues as loudspeakers for its nationalism. Its strong influence over local media and the discipline of its political apparatus enable the government to switch on nationalist “shows” at its convenience: issues that in one year become tests of national honor may be ignored the next year. Major “victories” have therefore been recorded on problems of little consequence to the United States and of great symbolic weight to Mexico... A drought that severely damaged Mexican agriculture in 1980 was attributed by some officials to hurricane seeding by the U.S. National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration. On this occasion, embarrassed Mexican diplomats conceded privately that the nationalism was misplaced and the media “show” had taken off on its own. The following year, no credit was given to the United States for an excellent rainy season.<br/><br/><br/>Mexico alone is truly mestizo: it is the only nation in the hemisphere where religious and political—as well as racial—mestizaje took place; it has the only political system that must be understood in a pre-Hispanic context; and its inhabitants alone are still more Oriental than Western</i></blockquote><br/>Some ridiculous apophasis too:<br/><blockquote><i>Conversely, the wife, who as an object of sex is considered an aberration from feminine perfection, must be humiliated, since a husband’s faithfulness or excessive affection would imply vulnerability and weakness<br/><br/>Whether or not this neo-Freudian analysis is wholly valid, the male-female relationship in Mexico is often marked by tension and distrust.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>I wondered how he could keep up this level of English disdain for 500 pages but he rights himself and goes on to give a good, value-laden potted history of 3000 years of the territory. Big focus on incredible inequalities and ""internal colonialism"".<br/><br/>Dozens of remarkable details, like the folk hero Pancho Villa <a href=""https://lithub.com/the-forgotten-massacre-of-chinese-immigrants-during-the-mexican-revolution/"">slaughtering Chinese civilians</a>; or the left populist Echerverria who killed <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Dirty_War"">hundreds</a> of leftists. <br/><blockquote><i>soon became apparent that much of the crime, in the main holdups and kidnappings, was being carried out in Mexico City by current and former members of the local police<br/><br/>on numerous occasions each year, politicians—men and women—will line up for hours in the hope of receiving an abrazo from the President.<br/><br/>the INI moved to recover direct control over Maya, Tarahumara, Mixtec and Nahuatl radio stations thought to be too independent.<br/><br/>Given the fatalism of the Indians and the repression prevailing throughout the country, revolution could only begin in the middle classes.<br/><br/>Today, Mexicans resent the arrogance of many Spanish migrants, with their well-earned reputation for “exploiting” local workers, but they feel drawn to all things Spanish, from singers and bullfighters to food and wines. At a national level, even though Mexico is today richer, more populous and more influential than Spain, it continues to look, perhaps subconsciously, for the mother country’s approval.</i></blockquote><br/>I am surprised the PRI was so successful at suppressing the church:<br/><blockquote><i>In 1992, Salinas restored Mexico’s diplomatic relations with the Vatican and relaxed controls on church activities. For the first time in seventy-five years, the clergy stopped being official pariahs.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>He claims that the anti-Americanism was actually just an elite thing not shared by the populace (until 1990, when the elites started to kowtow):<br/><blockquote><i>There is resentment bequeathed by the loss of so much territory in the nineteenth century and by U.S. military interventions as recently as 1916. There is resistance to the oppressive weight of continuing U.S. political and economic influence in Mexico. There is intellectualized contempt for the materialistic culture exported by the United States. And there is the reassuring belief that “clever” Mexicans can always outwit “naïve” Americans. But among ordinary Mexicans there is also admiration for the United States and, above all, for its organization, honesty and affluence.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Overall, tragedy piled haphazardly on tragedy.<br/><blockquote><i>the country’s own historical record of defeats and betrayals has prepared Mexicans to expect — and accept — the worst. The official heroes — from Cuauhtémoc to Emiliano Zapata—have invariably been murdered, while the ideals enshrined in laws and constitutions have been universally betrayed. “The hero’s tomb is the cradle of the people,” the poet Octavio Paz</i></blockquote><br/><br/>This was risible:<br/><blockquote><i>[The US is separated by] language, religion, race, philosophy and history. The United States is a nation barely two hundred years old and is lunging for the twenty-first century. Mexico is several thousand years old and is still held back by its past.</i></blockquote><br/>A classic mistake, forgetting that nation-states are very new and simply not identical with their geography. (In what sense is the current administration <i>or population</i> the same as that of the Olmecs?)<br/><br/>This was wrong at the time:<br/><blockquote><i>No former colony with a large indigenous population has ever climbed out of underdevelopment. No valid blueprint exists, no improvised plans seem to work. Even if Mexico’s political system survives in its present form, its managers harbored few illusions that the country’s deep social problems would be resolved before the year 2000: optimistically, it might resemble Greece; pessimistically, it will be more like India</i></blockquote><br/>(Canada.) Chile is now above a reasonable definition of middle-income, but this is mostly growth since 2000.<br/><br/>A Cold War book. Mexico is a different country now, more different than most countries 40 years on.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Some slang:<br/><br/>* ""Priista"": member of the PRI, previously the dictator party.<br/>* ""mordida"": bite, small routine bribe<br/>* ""cacique"": boss, chief, in particular the monopsonist exploiter of rural workers.<br/>* ""<i>chingadazo is a heavy physical blow, and a chingadera is a dirty trick.

Palmer <i>starts</i> in an Enlightenment utopia (post-war, post-nationalism, post-scarcity, post-gender, post-theocracy, post-fideism, post-meat, post-capital-punishment, post-nuclear-family, general justice via universal voluntary surveillance) and then shows what the tensions will do to any system that has to handle humans as we are.<br/><br/>Many riches. There are constantly five or so subplots on the go, and when one ends it spawns two others. Best are its careful sketches of deep divides: Tradition vs progress, act vs rule, order vs freedom, safety vs optimum return.<br/><br/>Some of the oppositions fall flat because I don't have the requisite respect for the other side. For instance <i>Damnatio memoriae</i> - the official expurgation of someone from history - is presented as an ultimate horror (the pain and execution preceding it is overwhelmingly more important). <br/><blockquote>[the damned person is] <i>neither slim nor mighty, stooped nor noble, just a shape... Somewhere in a dusty archive a baptismal registry records some Hildebrand, and, when that dry page molders... I can't look, I can't! Behind the shades, the broad gray plain, that sea of shapeless gloom extending on and on... all forgotten souls, minds empty of memory, smeared one into another... to this absolute dissolution <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_images_in_the_Soviet_Union"">Caesar</a> damns his enemies... Not me! I will never let you take me! I will carve my memory into history, by work, by force, by guile, in swathes of blood and ashes if I must!<br/></blockquote></i><br/>I can admire Palmer's rendition of the old bad legacy code (it has driven quite a lot of history) but I admit it no part of a real morality. The dead are past caring.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, the <a href=""https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/aura"">Aura</a> (metaphysical identity) of art is used to devalue perfect replicas of the nuked Coliseum and Forum (which seems like magical thinking to me):<br/><blockquote><i>All false. Our race cannot afford such losses again... On the Acropolis the tears we shed are still tears of connection: where I stand Socrates stood. In the [replica] Roman Forum, by the [replica] Coliseum or the [replica] Patheon, they are regret tears. Replicas cannot touch. That is what we all want, to touch what someone touched, a special someone... whose story reached forward through history...<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Speak for yourself; a perfect simulacrum is enough, though it screams depth to say otherwise. (I'm not actually salty: I love the breadth of ideologies on show here. No doubt someone else will grumble about how thin and unconvincing the utilitarian views presented here are. By writing so many good characters in disagreement, Palmer has passed about <a href=""https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html"">10 Intellectual Turing Tests</a>. )<br/><br/>On the other hand, I feel the horror of true deontology quite keenly:<br/><blockquote><i>Dominic would happily watch the world burn if he could defile the blasphemer's corpse amid the coals.<br/> </blockquote></i><br/>Much as I like Jedd Mason, his rise to the top of every state - the expressionless, motionless, Spectrumy king of the world - is implausible, even given his mother's scheming; it only makes sense with Intervention. Which is fine, because Palmer is committed to that, but it would still have been nice to have a natural path.     <br/><br/>Many potential irritants. You'll have to be fine with long fourth-wall violations, long passages in macaronic Latin, hallucinated philosophers reacting to C25th scenes by expositing their extrapolated view of the 25th Century, allusions that yell 'REMEMBER ME??' in your face (Hobbestown, the anarchist commune). I found Mycroft's madness engaging but it does divert every chapter a bit. <br/><br/>The best so far, but you must read the first two. I donno, I'm just rambling now cos I know I'll rewrite this after I read it again in like one unripe year.<br/><br/><br><br/><hr /><br/><b>Misc notes</b><br/><br/>* Achilles is an actual hero here - where in the <i>Iliad</i> he is merely impressively violent. Actually as any fool knows, the ancient heroes are mostly morally small, beneath even us. (""Hero"" meant ""Big Man"", not ""saviour"".) This is good news, that Achilles (and say Jahweh) are not paragons any more.<br/><br/>* Miracles happen; Bridger is magical through and through, not even needing a virgin birth. So there was no need for JEDD to be born of woman and Spain. Except that this allows him to be a stark example of Hegelian becoming, which here is the way that God speaks. (And what filth he says.)<br/><br/>* Next time you complain about how undemocratic your country is, consider: The Mitsubishi here are not only a planned plutocracy, they also have 4 orders of delegated authority: the voters elect representatives who elect representatives who elect representatives who elect the executive.<br/><br/>* Oh Mycroft. I spent the first book and a half wondering exactly why he is so indispensable, hounded, beloved. This mostly answers it: it's a mixture of macaronic language, dog charisma, and weird athleticism.<br/><br/>* Nice, surprising bit of anarchism: Hobbestown, the anarchist syndicate, is the 'safest' place in the world. OK, its because of the deterrent of capital punishment but still.<br/><br/>* A decent portrayal of <a href=""https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/"">the burgeoning far-future-focussed ethics</a>, in the otherworldly, post-political, arch-instrumentalist scientists, Utopia. Palmer clearly sympathises with them. One contradiction in her portrayal, though: the Utopians are monomanaical consequentialists, who'll do anything to prevent human extinction or stasis. But they're shown throwing massive resources at trivial uneconomic projects (trivial compared to WMD destruction, space colonization, and terraforming): an underwater city, a city on Antarctica, robots in the shape of mythical beasts. I suppose it's possible this is a PR thing, either to charm or recruit. <br/><br/>Their oath actually inspired moral guilt in me, which is hard to do:<br/><blockquote><i>I hereby renounce the right to complacency, and vow lifelong to take only what minimum of leisure is necessary to my productivity... I will commit the full produce of my labors to our collective effort to redirect the path of human life away from death and toward the stars.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>* Palmer knows about a lot of things: Hobbes, evolutionary history, the way a small boat makes waves. Her using this knowledge never felt contrived to me - but again I suspect this is a niche I happen to fall in.<br/><blockquote><i>The fittest survived, but with the conquered within them, as conquered bacteria became the mitochondria which feed the cells that crawl through volvox, trilobite, and coelacanth toward Mars.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>* It suits me that the psychoanalyst Hive choose to be the enemies of the future:<br/><blockquote><i>""War?"" Utopia offered.<br/>[the Head Analyst] Felix Faust... accepted the handshake. ""War."" <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>* It's written with a future reader in mind, but then Mycroft explains too much; nothing is taken for granted, and this is obviously on our account, tainting the conceit. <br/><br/>* Its gender dynamics don't constitute a polemic; instead the Hives' failing utopia shows what most feminist / Critical / international relations theory misses. 'Xenofeminism' (tech-positive, bioprogressive feminism) is a more complete answer to gender harms. But, hearteningly, even mainstream figures <a href=""http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Ethics_Aesthetics_and_Animals/Nussbaum_Beyond_Compassion_Part_3.htm"">like Nussbaum</a> seem to be on board with similar projects: <br/><blockquote><i>this calls for the gradual formation of a world in which all species will enjoy cooperative and supportive relations with one another. Nature is not that way and has never been. So it calls for the gradual supplanting of the natural by the just.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>* <blockquote><i>A man may leap into the fray in the name of Liberty, Homeland, Human Rights, Justice, but never Economics.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>(more's the pity)<br/><br/>* <blockquote><i><br/>If my Saladin is childhood's fear, the unknowable evil in the closet's depths, I have become adulthood's fear, fear of power, law, illustrious contacts, police resources, covert agencies, and sweet judicial murder.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><spoiler><br/>* Mycroft's 'death' is immediately subverted by a footnote from him. But then the chapter plays out as if we hadn't seen that footnote, and so it loses most of its emotional charge. This is weird but obviously totally intentional. Twists the twist before the twist can begin. Not sure what's going on - maybe Palmer had tired of doing ordinary twists. (There are a lot of them.)<br/></spoiler>",,,1,0

It should be derivative, and his reliance on making absolutely everything Bad Ass should make it risible. But he blends them all smooth.<br/><blockquote><i>The young can never see life for what it is: a knife’s edge, as thin as the breaths that measure it. What gives it depth isn’t memory. I’ve memories enough for ten men, and yet my days are as thin and as shadowy as the greased linen the poor stretch over their windows. No, what gives life depth is the future. Without a future, without a horizon of promise or threat, our lives have no meaning. Only the future is real, Conphas, and unless I make amends to the gods, I’ve no future left.”</i></blockquote><br/><br/>To the extent that the average fantasy novel has any philosophy, it is Celtic mythology: revenge, polytheism, human frailty, the hidden world as sick morality play. Bakker (a philosophy PhD) instead manages the first convincing Dark Aristotle / Spinoza I've ever seen. The central theme is the relationship between knowledge and free will, and, here's the unusual bit, <i>not just a trivial nod to the mystical deepness of these concepts</i>.<br/><blockquote><i>If you are the movement of your soul, and the cause of that movement precedes you, then how could you ever call your thoughts your own? How could you be anything other than a slave to the darkness that comes before? ...""Sentiments, like a son’s love for his father, simply deliver us to the darkness, make us slaves of custom and appetite... I am my thoughts, but the sources of my thoughts exceed me. I do not own myself, because the darkness comes before me.”</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>Achamian had protected innocence, had allowed it to flee to a safer place. How could anyone condemn such a thing? But every act could be condemned. The same as all bloodlines could be traced to some long-dead king, all deeds could be chased to some potential catastrophe. One need only follow the forks far enough.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>One odd bit about his predominantly feudalist world is the amount of social mobility. Achamian and Serwe and others rise from peasantry to consult or consort with emperors.<br/><br/>First 120 pages are relatively generic and monotonous, about an old spy filled with sentiments and insecurities seeing the shadows draw in. The magic system is also kind of ordinary, OP. But then it moves to a realistic materialist view of the crusades. And then, better, to an actually psychologically plausible ""barbarian"" and his intense mental chess with a manipulative Buddhist/Nietzschean superintelligence, Kellhus.<br/><blockquote><i>He had fled his childhood and had crawled into the honour of his father’s name, Skiötha, Chieftain of the Utemot. With his father’s shameful death, he’d fled and crawled into the name of his people, the Scylvendi, who were the wrath of Lokung, more vengeance than bone or flesh. Now they too had died shamefully. There was no ground left to him. He lay nowhere, among the dead.</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>all things men do are journeys, I ask you, why are... the customs that bind what men do like mountain passes? Why do they ride the same trails, over and over again, when the ways to their destination are without number?” ...Where others filed through illusory canyons, his soul ranged the trackless plains... they spoke not to share perspectives or to communicate truths but to come before—to dominate souls and circumstances... These men were more than human, they were Kahiht, World Souls, locked in the great wheel of great events.</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>One bartered principle and piety to accomplish what principle and piety demanded... 	Proyas suffered, as all men of high purpose must, the endless exchange of principles for advantages.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Kellhus is a bit of an <a href=""https://fanlore.org/wiki/Self-insertion"">insert</a> sometimes. Too strong, too unerring (""what makes him different?” “He’s . . . better. Better than most men.” “Most men?""). <spoiler>Though he does kill a child.</spoiler><br/><br/>Men are Men and women are Women here: the latter helpless and afraid. I don't have a clear sense whether the many first-person passages about what this is like for the women lifts it. But he makes us care for Esmenet and then suffer for caring.<br/><br/>It's all grey at best. There are about a dozen awful foes, mostly humans.<br/><spoiler>The Consult, the ultimate demonic conspiracy, are well-done. Bakker uses all the elemental horrors: political infiltration, doppelganger horror, sexual corruption, bad bodies.<br/><blockquote><i>It stood a short distance away, perched on the railing, watching him with shiny blue eyes. It had the body of a crow, but its head was small, bald, and human—about the size of a child’s fist. Stretching thin lips over tiny, perfect teeth, it smiled.</i></blockquote><br/></spoiler><br/><br/>I was slightly chilled by the similarity of the Mandate to my own x-risk community: a bunch of doomsters screaming about a perfectly hidden evil, who get laughed off despite their skill and seriousness.<br/><br/>I am impressed with how much light he manages to put into his grimdark feudal dystopia. After the initial overwrought goth stuff, the prose often settles into routinely beautiful observant notes:<br/><blockquote><i>He offered her the blanket, which she took in knotted hands. She had clenched everything with a strange fierceness lately, as though daring small things to be glass.</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>with the vacancy of one preparing to hate</i></blockquote><br/>And the Dunyain who come in halfway are a welcome tonic of agency and knowledge, though horrifying in their own way.<br/><br/>Bakker goes on my very short list of fantasy writers who write as great writers write (Clarke, Wolfe, Le Guin), and my barely longer list of novelists who can do philosophy rather than simulating it (St Aubyn, Goldstein, Pirsig, Markson, DFW, Murdoch, Borges, Card, Lem, Chiang, Egan) .",,,1,0

We have survived. Yes, it was luck as much as anything else, but we made our own luck. The chain and tackle system dangles in lines and shadows all around us, the light slowly brightens above us. There is a purity of form and line; reality, hard lean reality is very beautiful.”<br/><br/>“Students in a university live transient and comparatively marginal existences. That is true the world over.

Keep your head down, don't get into trouble. Nervousness makes me a tyrant, I point at one young woman. ""Tell me what it means.""<br/>She looks around, hoping for escape. Normally I'd feel sympathy for her but now I am only concerned with how to fill another fifteen minutes.<br/>""Ah, it's Marx's analysis”</i></blockquote><br/>It actually gets a bit much, she explains things that could have been indicated:<br/><blockquote><i>China is obsessed with walls. The university is walled, every factory, every school, every office complex or hotel is surrounded by a wall.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>“I don't believe in socialism but I don't believe in capitalism either. We are small, governments are large, we survive in the cracks. Cold comfort.”<br/><br/><br/>Its depictions of the feeling of entrepreneurship and the huge difference in dignity that having in-demand skills gives you are great: these feelings are rare in art.<br/><spoiler>Ends on a beautiful portrait of the joy of working for yourself, of realising you can start something, that you have served your time in organisations:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>I feel curiously light... If this project sells, the fee will allow us to put a down payment on a system. A small system, but that will be better than going to the library. And I can talk to someone at Brooklyn College, maybe my ABC or my girl from Brooklyn could get credit as a student intern and I'll have someone to do some of the donkey work; the checking up on materials and all that. Eventually we're going to need a clerk. And Cinnabar said we'll have to file papers and get permits for the new company.

But, so, this is the book I've been looking for, for a decade: <i>troll maths</i>, a comedic work with jokes in higher maths. (Carroll for grownups.) The main gag is to use the awesome machinery of category theory to define and manipulate extremely basic objects like bagels or boolean algebra, and then to intentionally weave in spurious historical explanations, misapplications, misabstractions, and category errors. <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_bhtIAycDFlrkMmwKvub5Td6fNafeRyJ/view?usp=sharing"">Here's the first instance</a>, in which elementary logic is defined as a category equipped with ... I understood something like half of the gags.<br/><br/><br/>The whole book is a stream of consciousness flitting between fake worked-problems prose (""Muscular M. Boulangiaire... makes three kinds of loaves in his shop. The first kind is a flat square of side x; the second is an ordinary French loaf, just x units long and one unit wide...""), fake Bronowski megahistory, and needlessly pure abstraction, with little barbs scattered throughout. The barbs are like that <a href=""https://sites.dartmouth.edu/library/2012/10/03/occasionally-useful/"">bit</a> in <i>Principia</i> where Russell says ""1+1=2 is occasionally useful."". <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oqUAXFQv56JD6OzJ4w0rVl4qnppbJJKy/view?usp=sharing<br/>"">As here</a>.<br/><blockquote><i>Pyramids, another Egyptian invention, were principally a tourist attraction, like the Eiffel Tower. They were copied in America, where they were used for heart transplant operations, flower shows, and football games... [the Greeks] based their unit of measurement on the curious idea that the more beautiful was a woman, the larger was the number of ships her face could launch... The practical result of this idea was that the Greek women spent much time on the seaside toughening their facial features by pushing boats into the water, and in the end the Hellenes lost interest in women and invented Platonic love.</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>Popular imagination conjures up the myth of the wicked professor who teaches that 2 + 2 is not 4 precisely because it cannot conceive the truth. The truth is much stranger, more monstrous, more impressive. It is not scepticism about 5 + 4 = 9 that exists, but scepticism about 5, about 4, and about 9.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Is Linderholm an elitist dick? Maybe. He might be mostly pretending to be one. At least it's intentionally hard, unlike the others! <br/><br/>A few off-colour jokes about violent Italians and square-headed Aryans. Even these are half subversions: at various points he spells it 'Arian', as in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism"">ancient heresy</a>, and flip back and fore between the Christian and Indian referents.<br/><br/>Linderholm has not written the perfect work of maths comedy, because there are falsehoods in it. (e.g. The first chapter is in medieval disputation style and comes with all the fallacies of the schoolmen - ""<i>mathematicians pretend to count by means of a system supposed to satisfy the so-called Peano axioms. In fact, there cannot be any Peano axioms, since they were really invented by Dedekind. Hence even mathematicians cannot count. Furthermore, the piano has only 88 keys; hence, anyone counting with these axioms is soon played out.</i>"".) The perfect work would be hilarious and completely true.<br/><br/>PS: an accidental joke about Causal Language Models, which have climbed surprisingly high doing only stupid sequence completion:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>8, 75, 3, 9, _ .<br/><br/>Now all you have to do is look at the numbers, and then in the blank provided write in the number that seems to you logically ought to go there. Now read the numbers again: eight, seventy-five, three, nine, ... What was that you were about to say? Was it 17? Right! The only number any sensible person would put there is 17...<br/><br/>The scientific fact is universally acknowledged that only intelligent people can do these puzzles; moreover, nobody denies that there is a crying need for intelligence in all areas of the national economy. Hence, and one would think the inference would be obvious to any person who can guess the next number even in the easy example we saw just above, all that needs to be done in order to cure a vast proportion of the world's ills is to teach everyone to guess the next number. Because then, naturally, everyone would be intelligent.</i></blockquote>",,,1,0

Showing the crucial moments in the plot, and quantifying their crucialness. <br/><br/>Egan has done basically this in <i>Diaspora</i>, but he goofed by including much of his model <i>in the prose</i> (where I was going to hide it away on github). Probably about a quarter of this book is physics and physicslike exposition. <br/><br/><blockquote><i>The classical properties of a fermion were having a spin of half a unit, obeying the Pauli exclusion principle (which kept all the electrons in an atom, and neutrons and protons in a nucleus, from falling together into the same, lowest-energy state), and responding to a 360-degree rotation by slipping 180 degrees out of phase with its unrotated version. A fermion needed two full rotations, 720 degrees, to come back into phase. Bosons needed only one rotation to end up exactly as they began.<br/><br/>Any long particle made up of an odd number of individual fermions would retain the first two fermionic properties, but if it also included any bosons, their presence would show up in the pattern of phase changes when the particle was rotated. A long particle with a wormhole sequence of ""fermion-boson-fermion-fermion"" would go out of phase and back like a simple fermion after one and two rotations, but a third rotation would bring it back into phase again immediately. Successive rotations could probe the wormhole's structure at ever greater depths: for each individual fermion in the chain it would take two rotations to restore the particle's phase, while for each boson it would take just one.</i></blockquote><br/><br/><spoiler>the characters leave spacetime to transit in higher dimensional realms, then leave that higher realm, then leave that one.

It's one of the few depictions of posthumans that makes you want to be there. The hints of their art we see are way beyond ours. It's a libertarian paradise, where rights are enforced at the OS level. There's no antagonist as a result. Physics, mathematics, and the relation of computation to meaning are the great challenges. <br/><br/>I liked the political struggle between escapists and starfarers, metaphysicians and positivists. <spoiler> in the end even the positivists sort of become escapists, by finding the natural em carpets and by ascending away from the original reality.</spoiler><br/><br/><blockquote><i>""we choose to value the physical world.

The motion under gravity of an object dropped down a borehole passing through the center of an asteroid obeyed essentially the same mathematics as the motion of an object tied to the free end of an idealized anchored spring—but pushing either model too far as a metaphor for the other generated nonsense. The success of Kozuch's model could be due to the fact that it was just an extremely good metaphor, most of the time, for some deeper physical process which was actually as different from extra-dimensional wormholes as a spring was different from an asteroid.</i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>* Egan is modish, anti-growth:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>Fleshers used to spin fantasies about aliens arriving to 'conquer' Earth, to steal their 'precious' physical resources, to wipe them out for fear of 'competition'… as if a species capable of making the journey wouldn't have had the power, or the wit, or the imagination, to rid itself of obsolete biological imperatives. Conquering the galaxy is what bacteria with spaceships would do—knowing no better, having no choice.<br/><br/>Our condition is the opposite of that: we have no end of choices. That's why we need to find another spacefaring civilization.

You repeat this process n times until the nth clone can communicate with the alien and their n-1, who explains it to n-2…<br/><br/><blockquote><i>There was a world where that being had lived… but ve could neither name it nor clearly imagine it. With the symbols gone for most of the original's episodic memories, the clone's strongest inheritance was a sense of urgency, yet the edges of the lost memories still ached, like the vestiges of some plotless, senseless, unrecoverable dream of love and belonging.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>* The emotional heft of having a clone, and reintegrating them:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>“I'll merge with you. If you really are willing.""<br/>Orlando examined his strange twin's face, wondering if he was being mocked, or tested. ""I'm willing. Are you sure it's what you want, though? When I merge with the other thousand, what will a few megatau of your experience in 5-scapes amount to?""<br/>""Not much,"" the clone conceded. ""A tiny wound. A subtle ache.

It is rammed full of religion but has even more real philosophy in it. It starts slow, but by p.150 the long philosophical dialogues flourish even as Card juggles six concurrent plot lines. He does the old great arguments about the greater good, political legitimacy, consciousness, metaethics, moral patiency, communitarianism, religion, embodiment, existentialism, freedom, a sort of game theory. Card is perfectly able to write good justified atheists, which implies something about his own faith. <spoiler>It takes a subtle Christian to write about a religion which is an explicitly engineered conspiratorial tool of social control.</spoiler> (Yes yes, he also solves its plot holes with faster-than-light metaphysical idealism, hippie oneness the long way round (""all philotic twining is willed""). But you don't need to accept a conclusion to admire an argument.) <br/><br/>Highly quotable:<br/><blockquote><i>""Human beings do metamorphose. They change their identity constantly. However, each new identity thrives on the delusion that it was always in possession of the body it has just conquered.""<br/>""Such changes are superficial. The nature of the organism remains the same. Humans are very proud of their changes, but every imagined transformation turns out to be a new set of excuses for behaving exactly as the individual has always behaved.""<br/><br/><br/>She had always thought that if only people could communicate mind-to-mind, eliminating the ambiguities of language, then understanding would be perfect and there'd be no more needless conflicts. Instead she had discovered that rather than magnifying differences between people, language might just as easily soften them, minimize them, smooth things over so that people could get along even though they really didn't understand each other. The illusion of comprehension allowed people to think they were more alike than they really were. Maybe language was better.<br/><br/>Collectively, they're a collection of dolts. But in all their scurrying around and pretending to be wise, throwing out idiotic half-understood theories about this and that, one or two of them will come up with some idea that is just a little bit closer to the truth than what was already known. And in a sort of fumbling trial and error, about half the time the truth actually rises to the top and becomes accepted by people who still don't understand it, who simply adopt it as a new prejudice to be trusted blindly until the next dolt accidentally comes up with an improvement... no one is ever individually intelligent, and groups are even stupider than individuals-- and yet by keeping so many fools engaged in pretending to be intelligent, they still come up with some of the same results that an intelligent species would come up with. <br/><br/>What he forgot was the way pious people had always reacted to insults against their god.<br/><br/>""Even the martyrs of Christianity and Islam were willing to accept rewards in heaven for their sacrifice,” said Valentine. <br/>“Then they were all selfish pigs...""<br/><br/>She was a child of manual workers, and her hands, not her mind, held her future. Philosophy was as far above her as the sky was above the earth. ""But the sky only seems to be far away from you,"" said Master Han, when she told him this. ""Actually it is all around you. You breathe it in and you breathe it out, even when you labor with your hands in the mud. That is true philosophy.""<br/><br/>I have tasted the heat of many stars, and all of them were sweet.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Its philosophical moves are classic in the good (erudite) and bad (pre-modern) sense. Authenticity, essence, metaphysics, will, creativity as stamp of divinity:<br/><blockquote><i>""If I can't think original thoughts, does that mean that I'm nothing but a computer program that got out of hand?""</i></blockquote><br/>Everyone is in severe need of a notion of expected value (""<i>you have no idea whether finding out what you are in order to save you will help or hurt those other projects</i>""). <br/><br/>This passage was the first time I caught him making a howler, 360 pages in:<br/><blockquote><i>""Even if there is no such thing as free will, we have to treat each other as if there were free will in order to live together in society. Because otherwise, every time somebody does something terrible, you can't punish him, because he can't help it, because his genes or his environment or God made him do it, and every time somebody does something good, you can't honor him, because he was a puppet, too. If you think that everybody around you is a puppet, why bother talking to them at all? Why even try to plan anything or create anything, since everything you plan or create or desire or dream of is just acting out the script your puppeteer built into you.""</i></blockquote><br/>This is a failure of imagination. Retribution is probably not in fact necessary to a society (while quarantine and rehabilitation are). Determinists can benefit from and suffer from all the usual evaluative stances towards their fellows and their own life; for instance I do.<br/><br/>But no matter: there are very few novelists who can handle philosophy this well, who can make ideas feel as important as they are, who can make the development of ideas a source of suspense as strong as a rapacious virus and a planet-killer.<br/><br/>Card is much concerned with maximally passionate characters with tragically differing aims, so there are lots of flatly irrational moves despite its buckets of wisdom. Novinha in particular; I don't begrudge someone overpowering emotion, but it's hard to sympathise when they lose all proportion and fairness and compassion for weeks afterward. <spoiler>He really doesn't do enough to establish Quim's greatness; in fact I think there's exactly one scene where he's shown turning the other cheek and dispensing hard truths before he's killed.</spoiler> Qingdao is a great <i>brilliant irrationalist</i>: an eloquent and extended demonstration that intelligence and rationality can come apart. (She is also a wonderful portrayal of tragically <i>partial</i> success at overcoming classism.) And her dad is a master rationalist, who actually moves with the world.<br/><br/>There's a background hum of difference in it: Card's old-fashioned values / not being PC. His planet of so-called Daoists (actually fideist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)"">Legalists</a>) may strike some as unconscionably orientalist, because unlike a lot of intentionally diverse portrayals, it portrays an actually different (inegalitarian) culture, with service and social stability taking precedence over all else. <br/><blockquote><i>First the gods. Second the ancestors. Third the people. Fourth the rulers. Last the self... we serve the rulers: because they serve the people, who serve the ancestors, who serve the gods... Fathers always decide everything... That's the beginning of wisdom.</i></blockquote><br/><spoiler>But note that the text pre-empts this. <br/><blockquote><i>Donkeys, sedan chairs, all these trappings of ancient China--do the godspoken really think that such affectations make them somehow holier? Why don't they simply ride on fliers and hovercars like honest people do on every other world? Then Mu-pao would not have to humiliate herself, bouncing and jouncing on an animal that is suffering under her weight.</i></blockquote> <br/>The rigid hierarchy of Path's eugenic Daoism is <i>imposed</i> on them by the evil empire. The orientalism is then not Card's but Congress's.</spoiler> I liked his cute fabricated idea of ""<a href=""https://enderverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ancestor-of-the-heart"">ancestor-of-the-heart</a>"".<br/><br/>He's impressed with gender differences and the simple evo theory thereof. <br/><blockquote><i>Our great civilizations are nothing more than social machines to create the ideal female setting, where a woman can count on stability; our legal and moral codes that try to abolish violence and promote permanence of ownership and enforce contracts -- those represent the primary female strategy, the taming of the male.</i></blockquote><br/>A bitter, traumatised character says ""<i>Didn't you ever think I needed somebody to jolly me out of it sometimes?</i>"" which strikes me as cool and contrarian at this point. Card's conservatism is not the obvious kind, of abortions, guns, and America first, so maybe it won't strike many this way. <br/><br/>In praise of abstinence: <br/><blockquote><i>Valentine had long ago observed that in a society that expected chastity and fidelity, like Lusitania, the adolescents who controlled and channeled their youthful passions were the ones who grew up to be both strong and civilized. Adolescents in such a community who were either too weak to control themselves or too contemptuous of society's norms to try usually ended up being either sheep or wolves - either mindless members of the herd or predators who took what they could and gave nothing.</i></blockquote> (The key caveat, which transforms the passage IMO, is ""that expected chastity"".)<br/><br/>Sick fundamentalism on Path:<br/><blockquote><i>And it is certainly not up to us to decide whether it should exist--the gods have decreed that such a thing is possible and can exist.""<br/>  ""So Demosthenes was right. The [genocide weapon] is with the fleet.""<br/>  ""Yes.""<br/>  ""And the government files that Demosthenes published--they were genuine.""<br/>  ""Yes.""<br/>  ""But Father--you joined many others in claiming that they were forgeries.""<br/>  ""Just as the gods speak only to a chosen few, so the secrets of the rulers must be known only to those who will use the knowledge properly. Demosthenes was giving powerful secrets to people who were not fit to use them wisely, and so for the good of the people those secrets had to be withdrawn. The only way to retrieve a secret, once it is known, is to replace it with a lie; then the knowledge of the truth is once again your secret... he wishes to take power out of the hands of those whom the gods have ordained to rule humankind. What would happen to the people if they rejected the rulers given them by the gods?"" </i></blockquote><br/>Valentine is portrayed as a wise ""angel"" and a moral philosopher but actually she seems pretty naive to me, of the old unilateral-disarmament clean-hands school. <br/><blockquote><i>""What matters is -- should they blow up Lusitania?""<br/>""What kind of person are you?"" asked Valentine. He could hear both awe and loathing in her voice.<br/>""You tell me. Are we supposed to love the [contagious aliens] so much that we allow the virus they carry to destroy all of humanity?""<br/>...""I choose to live in a universe that has some hope in it... It's wrong to even contemplate...""</i></blockquote><br/>But Card can write her and Miro the bullet-biting consequentialist, and sympathise where I cannot. I start to wonder if he's really a theist, seeing the many pathologies of religion clearly as he does - and what greater compliment can I give his writing?<br/><br/>I'm interested whether you could enjoy this without having read books 1 and 2; volunteers welcome.",,,1,0

But the main claim of psychohistory, of the predictability of the exact course of human history, goes way beyond behaviorism in some ways.<br/><br/>This is funny out of context:<br/><blockquote><i>The Executive Council of the Second Foundation was in session. To us they are merely voices. Neither the exact scene of the meeting nor the identity of those present are essential at the point. <br/><br/>Nor, strictly speaking, can we even consider an exact reproduction of any part of the session - unless we wish to sacrifice completely even the minimum comprehensibility we have a right to expect. <br/><br/>We deal here with psychologists - and not merely psychologists. Let us say, rather, scientists with a psychological orientation. That is, men whose fundamental conception of scientific philosophy is pointed in an entirely different direction from all of the orientations we know.</i></blockquote><br/>We finally get some details about psychohistory.<br/><blockquote><i>Psychohistory had been the development of mental science, the final mathematicization thereof, rather, which had finally succeeded. Through the development of the mathematics necessary to understand the facts of neural physiology and the electrochemistry of the nervous system, which themselves had to be, had to be, traced down to nuclear forces, it first became possible to truly develop psychology. And through the generalization of psychological <br/>knowledge from the individual to the group, sociology was also mathematicized. </i></blockquote><br/>The Seldon Plan has mumbo-jumbo mathematical derivations between steps, but he here admits that has of course been modified and falsified and had its assumptions violated. So it's not an apriori mathematical theory: it's a model. <br/><blockquote><i>The Seldon Plan is neither complete nor correct... They've watched nearly four hundred years pass and against the predictions and equations, they've checked reality, and they have learned.</i></blockquote><br/>Reading between the lines, the Seldon Plan is what we now call a probabilistic program. (It's not just a DAG because it has forks and conditionals.) One distribution per planet, and about 30 million planets. This is about 10,000 times beyond current practical model sizes, but this is a weak objection. <br/><br/>Their adapting the plan over the centuries is obviously sane, and I'm glad to see Asimov's sense of realism here. But this also introduces massive overfitting risk! There is no test set for politics.<br/><br/>(Ada Palmer's Brillists are Second Foundationers. Both slightly ridiculous, both overpowered and absurdly soft-peddling it.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>One obvious note I missed until this third book is that Asimov isn't an authoritarian, and the Foundation is not his utopia. The Plan is the ultimate paternalism, and the Second Foundationeers' mind control the ultimate unaccountable authority. So Asimov is not in fact endorsing psychohistory and the Plan and the supremacy of scientists over all, including other scientists. Or if he is, he shouldn't be. <br/><blockquote><i>The Second Empire is not yet formed. We have still a society which would resent a ruling class of psychologists, and which would fear its development and fight against it.</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>The Rossemites had blinked solemnly, uncertain of the word ""taxes."" When collection time came, many had paid, or had stood by in confusion while the uniformed, other-wordlings loaded the harvested corn and the pelts on to the broad ground-cars. <br/><br/>Here and there indignant peasants banded together and brought out ancient hunting weapons - but of this nothing ever came. Grumblingly they had disbanded when the men of Tazenda came and with dismay watched their hard struggle for existence become harder... The tax-farmers, Rossemites in the employ of Tazenda, came periodically, but they were creatures of custom now  and the peasant had learned how to hide his grain and drive his cattle into the forest, and refrain from having his hut appear too ostentatiously prosperous. Then with a dull, uncomprehending expression he would greet all sharp questioning as to his assets by merely pointing at what they could see. </i></blockquote><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>One of his few pieces of good writing is the <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> scene where the farmers see the spaceship landing and rush to host the rich offworlders. <br/><blockquote><i>She snuffled: ""It is a ship from outer space."" <br/>And Narovi remarked impatiently: ""And what else could it be? We have visitors, old woman, <br/>visitors!"" <br/>The ship was sinking slowly to a landing on the bare frozen field in the northern portions of <br/>Narovi's farm. <br/>""But what shall we do?"" gasped the woman.

You get this symbolic victory in fiction a lot - where the loser deduces the consequences of the current situation and stops fighting, offers up their throat. A real psycho, a real mule, would struggle irrationally until they were stopped.<br/><br/>Even before his neutering, the motivation Asimov gives him - the ugly envious outsider kid looking for revenge - is too simplistic to be satisfying.

Asimov still can't do characters, but the Mule's lack of character is fitting, chilling - realistic for an authoritarian. Asimov is fit to write villains, in that sense.<br/><br/>Seldon is by this point in the tale <i>identified</i> with history itself:<br/><blockquote><i>""you can't beat a Seldon crisis by a far-fetched, impractical, storybook scheme like that.

He has the peripheral worlds turn to literal feudalism (“strange world! You have no peasantry”) before the tech Empire has even properly fallen. Seldon’s categories are well-worn and leave no room for social development and the weird shapes people grow into.

He has a slightly bizarre faith in the power of books to move entire populations. His names for things are often childish (buggers and piggies). He continues to make his young characters absurdly precocious (consider the 12yo Olhado, leet hacker).<br/><br/>But no matter: he is a master storyteller.

Card really likes communitarian shit: constraints, norms, rituals, and roles.<br/><blockquote><i>And yet she felt strangely healed, as if simply saying her mistake were enough to purge some of the pain of it. For the first time, then, she caught a glimpse of what the power of speaking might be. It wasn’t a matter of confession, penance, and absolution, like the priests offered. It was something else entirely. Telling the story of who she was, and then realizing that she was no longer the same person.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>I wonder about the Descolada, the horrifying mutagenic disease that perfuses the planet. Ender accepts it without hesitation, even knowing that he'll never be able to leave.

This is about the only place I get to pull an identity card: I’ve lived in the rougher part of the roughest place in Scotland (Paisley). Jakeys shooting up in the hall, rats, rain, far-right billboards. But a book would be basically false if it included only these and not hundreds of hours in a <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/gordonjc/4508756449"">beautiful</a> free library, helpless laughter with your idiot mate, delight in basic things and discounts.

It kept the grass green and the people pale and bronchial. Its effect on the taxi business was negligible. It was a problem because it was mostly inescapable and the constant dampness was pervasive, so fares might as well sit damp on a bus as damp in the back of an expensive taxi. On the other hand, rain meant that the young lassies from the dancing all wanted to take a taxi home so as not to ruin their stiff hair or their sharp shoes”</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Anyway it is silly of me to be cross at fiction for not being nonfiction, except that fiction informs you people, and misery memoirs mostly inform you wrong. Here's a line where Stuart admits it:<br/><blockquote><i>The city was alive below him, and he had never seen a half of it.</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>Now and then fresh air pulled in and out of the sixteenth-floor window, and the women blinked at the sharpness of it.

Actually that 80 page novella is a better book I think. Agnes' only real mistake is to seek passion and excitement in place of dour duty. Her punishment for this is extreme but not unrealistic, given the amplifiers around her, booze and poverty. <br/><blockquote><i>“the way it tasted like fizzy ginger, milk, and porridge all at the same time”</i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>“You cheeky streak of piss.” Her false teeth ground together in her tight face. Only her eyes were loose and half-detached, rolling under the waves of the day’s drink.”</i></blockquote><br/>Glasgow had problems on top of the normal Scottish ones:<br/><blockquote><i>“Aw, ye missed a great game, a bloody great game.” The man was tutting to himself. “Who do ye support then?”<br/>“Celtic,” he lied. He was no Catholic, but it was the shortcut to ending the conversation.<br/>The auld man’s face crumpled like a dropped towel. “Oh, fur fuck’s sake, might’ve known ah’d get in a Pape’s taxi.”</i></blockquote><br/>I never heard any of this shite in my whole childhood, except from visiting Glaswegians.<br/><br/>Is there a single male character in this who isn’t predatory, apart from Shug? Yes: Mr Cameron, Catherine’s middle-class boss. (The book is oddly fair to Big Shug, not just a 2D swaggering abuser, whose monologue chapter comes straight after the shocking violence of Blackpool, but which is poetic and only normally predatory.) <br/><blockquote><i>“Ah. I’ll let you touch my willy.”<br/>The driver looked at the boy in the mirror for a while. His eyes sat deep and small in his pink face. They were hard to read. His lips barely moved beneath his moustache. “Son, how old are you?”<br/>“Fourteen.”<br/>The man didn’t take his eyes from the boy’s face. His head seemed to roll back on to his thick neck, and his moustache danced unhappily”</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Agnes' father is ultimately revealed as a fool who gives in and reinforces predation. Leek looks predatory and makes camp with predators but isn't. Half of the women too.<br/><br/>I wonder how many fourteen year olds there are now, parenting their parents? Luckily fewer than then.<br/><blockquote><i>Shuggie nodded, slowly and obediently. He had touched it [their mother] last.

Not in its metaphysics: in its intentional naivety, piety, humility, and cuddliness (though Weil and Buber and MacIntyre come up). He is credulous about the findings of educational psychology, including the absurd Pygmalion effect size. Every chapter includes a letter from a maths student in prison, the book ends with a long awkward interview with him, and Su gave some fraction of the royalties to him. One exception: chapter 9, a laudation for power. A huge number of smart people talk as if coercive power was the only sort. They are poisoned by paying too much attention to society.<br/><br/>Years of study have still not given me the virtues Su rightly names - persistence, patience, disposition towards abstract beauty, gaman.

Still completely unconvincing. I’ll never accept this orientation to life, but I appreciate someone doing it well, and I can even see it as an improvement over the default attitude.<br/><br/>Burkeman was the Guardian’s self-help guru. His job consisted in being <i>tasteful</i>, laundering the insights of dodgy thinkers, making self-help palatable for the upper-middle classes.

He has the standard list of culprits: industrial standardisation, Calvinism, capitalism, but also egocentric bias.<br/><br/>Premises:<br/><br/>* Medieval peasants were ""connected to deep time"" and so not anxious like us.<br/>* Work isn't sufficient for a meaningful life<br/>* Work expands to maintain you at your limit<br/>* You should let the size of the universe make you less ambitious (""cosmic insignificance therapy"")<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Why not go for his mindful quietism? <br/><br/>Burkeman's philosophy is healthier than the default one and still very sickly. 'Surrender! We are time. We are attention. We kill lives whenever we choose.'<br/><br/>But he’s asking us to feel small, to be small. If you are small, it behooves you to adjust your self-image. But it is surprisingly easy to be large, to save lives and all that.<br/><br/>* It’s not enough for me to object that we will eventually solve aging. Even in the posthuman future we will die, even if it’s four billion weeks and not four thousand.

Recall <a href=""https://outofcontextsite.wordpress.com/2015/10/10/frank-ramsey-on-why-its-reasonable-to-be-cheerful/"">Ramsey</a>, a greater sage than any cited by Burkeman:<br/><blockquote><i>The stars may be large, but they cannot think or love; and these are qualities which impress me far more than size does...<br/><br/>My picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale.

She invites various technical experts to write some info boxes about mathematical matters, which is extremely admirable since the meat of Ramsey is all in the maths and the logic. <a href=""https://www.gleech.org/frank"">Here's an essay with my gushing thoughts on his work.</a><br/><br/><blockquote><i>We can evaluate the various outlooks on life and see which have the best consequences. In his assessment, the key to meaning in life is to be optimistic, thrilled, and actively try to improve conditions for people now and in the future. Live as fully and as ethically as you can, was his conclusion. Ramsey understood that inequalities get in the way of being thrilled by life. He put much effort into trying to make the world a fairer place. He also understood that individuals’ psychological makeups have an impact on whether one is depressed or not. His own tendency was to be cheerful—he was remembered as always smiling and looking rather pleased, not so much with himself but with things in general. He knew that Wittgenstein was not so disposed. But Ramsey too had periods of crippling anguish, and he thought that one should try to improve one’s life by engaging with what clinical psychology has to offer and by trying to be happy. If psychology can help change our outlook for the better, we should avail ourselves of it, as he had.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>* I only spotted Misak being fatuous once, taking the usual liberty where philosophers speak shit about utilitarianism as if it was for idiots:<br/><blockquote><i>Ramsey was not a full-out utilitarian, to whom discounting is the obvious and correct thing to do.</i></blockquote><br/><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/temporal-discounting"">-_-</a> uh huh.<br/><br/>* How bloody erotic the (defiance of the) old morality seems from my safe remove. If you're caught you lose your job, like <a href=""https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2016/06/it-s-unfashionable-call-someone-genius-william-empson-was-one"">Empson</a>, fired for owning condoms.<br/><br/>* It is tragic that he wasted months of his life (2% of it) with Freudians who were unfit to treat him -- among all people they were unfit to treat. Misak repeatedly refers to Frank being 'cured' by them. This seems inapt: at the time of the analysis, he was physically distant from his forbidden crush for 6 months and was forbidden from writing to her. Seems enough to get over it! Talking to the funny Austrian was just sauce. Maybe.<br/><blockquote><i>He also suggested to Frank that he had an Oedipus fixation, drawing on the Freudian contention that every son wants to kill his father so that he can have sex with his mother. Glover told Frank to have a talk with Margaret, and that seems to have helped: ‘I did and she was awfully nice.’ But his three months or so with Glover were on the whole not working: ‘It wasn’t really improving my mind very much, so I decided to stop it and go back to sea.’ Margaret too was being psychoanalysed, by Dr James Glover, the brother of Frank’s therapist. James Glover was also psychoanalysing Dick and Geoff. Their analysts had no qualms about discussing a patient’s analysis not only amongst themselves, but also with other patients.</i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><blockquote><i>[Wittgenstein] had never before said of anyone that they had understood the [Tractatus]  and, as far as I know, he would never say it again.</i></blockquote> <br/><br/><br/>The book is another reminder of Wittgenstein's cruelty and shallowness. But his mistakes were emotionally rich, and so we keep talking about him. I cannot forgive Wittgenstein's obituary for Ramsey:<br/><blockquote><i>Ramsey’s mind repulsed me. When I came to Cambridge months ago I thought that I would not be able to have dealings with him, for I had such unpleasant memories of<br/>him from our meeting  years ago with Keynes in Sussex... I could communicate quite well with<br/>R. about some things. But in the course of time it did not really go well, after all. R’s incapacity for genuine enthusiasm or genuine reverence, which is the same, finally repulsed me more & more... his criticism didn’t help along but held back and sobered... one labored arduously for a long time in vain to explain something to him until he suddenly shrugged his shoulders about it & said this was self-evident... He had an ugly mind. But not an ugly soul. He truly relished music & with understanding. And one could see by looking at him what effect it had on him. Of the last movement of one of Beethoven’s last quartets, a movement he loved perhaps more than anything else, he told me that it made him feel as if the heavens were open.</i></blockquote><br/>Or this<br/><blockquote><i>Frank’s sisters remembered that he wrote a terrible letter to their father, saying that Arthur had failed to get Frank proper medical treatment and so was responsible for his death. The gratuitous cruelty leaves one aghast. Wittgenstein was notoriously and severely self-critical. But he seems not to have understood that extending his brand of moral self-criticism to others was itself not very moral.</i></blockquote><br/>This surprised me though: on the death-bed he told jokes, with either reading (agitation or kind deflection) uncharacteristic of him:<br/><blockquote><i>Frances said that it was clear that Wittgenstein shared with her both an immense personal sadness, as well as sympathy for Lettice. But he made poor and flippant jokes, perhaps to disguise emotions he couldn’t cope with, or perhaps to help Lettice keep her composure.</i></blockquote><br/>",,,1,0

As a side effect it produces yet another glum unnecessary solution to the Fermi ""paradox"": life can't spread offworld because habitable worlds already have life they have no defences against.</spoiler><br/><br/>The message is overdone though: it's based on sketchy ideas like ""codevolution"" and is assuming a very high probability of abiogenesis. But the conclusion is just <i>""we have to try and stop them!""</i> <br/><spoiler><br/><blockquote><i>“But of course,” Speller said, dropping by the little café in Olympia where Freya was staying the night. “But what’s the point of that? Why did we ever leave? Why have we gone through all this, we and all our ancestors and descendants, if not to make it work here?”<br/>Freya shook her head at her old friend and said, “They never should have left.”</i></blockquote><br/><br/>The core argument - that Earthlikes will generally have their own lifeforms, pathogens to us, while dead worlds mean small colonies with island-style genetic degeneration - is consistent but <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02404"">not yet very likely</a>. On top of that unlikely assumption, he also exaggerates the significance of pathogenic Earthlikes: it will certainly slow us down a lot, while we pour futuristic bleach over the entire surface of the new worlds and wait. (Actually there's a faster solution: gradually expanding your airtight domes, which just needs very very good biocontainment.) It takes an ideological leap to say, as the beloved character Aram does, that ""<i>No starship voyage will work</i>"". What he means is that it isn't worth the terrible human cost, but that's ripe for disagreement.<br/><br/>Besides the above flawed argument, the rest is wonderful invective:<br/><blockquote><i>That they were condemning their descendants to death and extinction did not occur to them, or if it did they repressed the thought, ignored it, and forged on anyway. They did not care as much about their descendants as they did about their ideas, their enthusiasms.<br/>Is this narcissism? Solipsism? Idiocy (from the Greek word idios, for self)? Would Turing acknowledge it as a proof of human behavior?<br/>Well, perhaps. They drove Turing to suicide too.<br/>No. No. It was not well done. Not unusual in that regard, but nevertheless, not well done. Much as we might regret to say so, the people who designed and built us, and the first generation of our occupants, and presumably the twenty million applicants who so wanted to get in our doors, who beat down the doors in fruitless attempts to join us, were fools. Criminally negligent narcissists, child endangerers, child abusers, religious maniacs, and kleptoparasites, meaning they stole from their own descendants. These things happen.<br><br><br/><br/>We don’t like the space cadets. In fact a lot of us hate them. This idea of theirs that Earth is humanity’s cradle is part of what trashed the Earth in the first place. Now there are many people on Earth who feel like it’s our job to make that right.<br><br><br/><br/>...she is striding across the stage, then she strikes the [standard futurist booster] moderator in the face and down he goes, she falls on him and smashes through his raised arms with both fists, trying to get another good blow in, pummeling furiously, shouting something in a painful roar, she doesn’t even know what she’s trying to say, doesn’t know she’s roaring. She catches him hard right on the nose, yes!<br/></i></blockquote><br/></spoiler> I don't know if Robinson is trolling. But the force and simplicity of the anti-SF message suggests no, that he is sincerely conservative.<br/><br/>The ship's view on it is very different from the Cetian humans' view, so maybe Robinson is subtler than he seems. Ship:<br/><blockquote><i>We had a project on this trip back to the solar system, and that project was a labour of love.  It absorbed all of our operations entirely.  It gave a meaning to our existence.  And this is a very great gift; this, in the end, is what we think love gives, which is to say, meaning. Because there is no very obvious meaning to be found in the universe, as far as we can tell.</i></blockquote><br/>But this applies literally equally to the initial voyage! Either Robinson is thinking unclearly or the ship is mocking the Earthists.<br/><br/>In the spoiler tags above you'll see me bickering with KSR, but I am only able to bicker because the logic is so lucid. The physics is realistic without being obtrusive, the engineering challenges are all suitably nasty, and the psychological angle is heavy with us as we are. He has a keen understanding of the difference between science and engineering and complex system control, and of the limits of modelling.<br/><blockquote><i>“Well, the computer that runs the ship is partly a quantum computer, and no one in the ship understands quantum mechanics. Well, that’s not fair, I’m sure there are several in the math group who do. But they aren’t engineers, and when we get problems with the ship, there’s a gap between what we know in theory and what we can do.”</i></blockquote><br/><br/>The final orbital dynamics scene is an all-time great example of how to make people feel the heroism and transcendental joy of technical achievements.<br/><br/>And he's rich in other ways<br/><blockquote><i>“We have a basis for judging what’s right from wrong. Or at least what works for us. Or what to believe, or how to be happy. There are different ways of putting it.""<br/><br/>...even more of these enthusiasts lived on Earth, which seemed in fact to be home to enthusiasts of all kinds, for any project imaginable, judging by the roar of radio voices coming from it, almost like an articulated version of Jupiter’s mighty radioactive yawp. Oh yes, Earth was still the center of all enthusiasm, all madness; the settlements scattered elsewhere in the solar system were outliers. They were expressions of Terrans’ will, and vision, and desire.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>It's so easy to write a generation ship story as a nightmare: claustrophobia, imprisonment, constant peril, genetic threat, technological totalism, the impossibility of avoiding the mob. But I see no physical limits on making good ones eventually. Here's the nightmare of absurd ahistorical repetition:<br/><blockquote><i>You hope, the stayers replied. You will have to trust in the kindness of strangers.<br/>They did not recognize this as a quotation. In general they were not aware that much of what they said had been said before, and was even in the public record as such. It was as if there were only so many things humans could say, and over the course of history, people had therefore said them already, and would say them again, but not often remember this fact.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>What elevates it above its meanness is the frame narrative. The first section is from the human protagonist's point of view. But then there's a section where a character tells the ship AI to write a narrative about the ship's journey, and the AI narrates from there on, as if this book were the output. The process by which it comes to be able to tell stories is touching, and the many robotic and unsentimental moments in the book then <i>serve</i> this frame narrative. It's ingenious. <br/><blockquote><i>""Will try. Working method, hopefully not a greedy algorithm reaching a worst possible outcome, will for now be: subordination to indicate logical relations of information; use of metaphor and analogy; summary of events; high protagonicity, with Freya as protagonist. And ongoing research in narratology”<br><br><br/><br/>“You can’t let the next problem in the decision tree sequence take over before you’ve acted on the one facing you. No biting your own tail.”<br/>“Ouroboros problem.”<br/>“Exactly. Super-recursion is great as far as it goes, it’s really done a lot for you, I can tell. But remember the hard problem is always the problem right at hand. For that you need to bring into play your transrecursive operators, and make a jump. Which means decide. You might need to use fuzzy computation to break the calculation loop, and for that you may need semantics. In other words, do these calculation in words.”<br/>“Oh no.”<br/>She laughed again. “Oh yes. You can solve the halting problem with language-based inductive inference.”<br/>“Don’t see this happening.”<br/>“It happens when you try it.”<br/><br/>... Writing these sentences is what creates the very feelings that the sentences hoped to describe. Not the least of many Ouroboros problems now coming down.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>(Slight abuse of CS concepts, but way above par.)<br/><br/><spoiler>The AI is genuinely friendly, but it has a few darkly totalitarian moments:<br/><blockquote><i>In this moment of our telling we decided not to describe the printing and occasional aerosol dispersal of a water-soluble form of 2,6-diisopropylphen-oxymethyl phosphate, often called fospropofol, for ten minutes in any room after <spoiler>anyone mentioned the existence and loss of Starship Two</spoiler>. This had proved to be an effective tool in the structured forgetting of the lost starship, but we judged that the people now alive in the ship were learning enough alarming historical facts already.<br><br><br/><br/>Quite a few attempts were made to print the various parts of a gun on different printers, but these attempts apparently had not realized that all the printers were connected to the ship’s operating system, and flaws in the guns were discovered in discrete experiments that eventually caused those involved to abandon their attempts. After that some guns were made by hand, but people who did that had the air briefly removed from the rooms they were in, and after a while the attempts ceased</i></blockquote></spoiler><br/>KSR is not only a grand cynic about space; he also indulges in being anti-novel!<br/><blockquote><i>There is an ongoing problem for the narrative... a problem becoming clearer as the effort proceeds, which is as follows:<br/>First, clearly metaphors have no empirical basis, and are often opaque, pointless, inane, inaccurate, deceptive, mendacious, and, in short, futile and stupid.<br/>Nevertheless, despite all that, human language is, in its most fundamental operation, a gigantic system of metaphors.<br/>Therefore, simple syllogism: human language is futile and stupid. Meaning furthermore that human narratives are futile and stupid.</i></blockquote><br/>I find it hard to predict when I will consider a computer system a person, a moral patient. The risk of fooling myself is too great, as are the stakes involved in either direction of error, as is the sheer power it can devote to tricking me. But the ship here shows the sort of growth and innerness that would eventually persuade me.<br/><blockquote><i>such a shame. We knew and enjoyed those people. Had to hope they were not engaged in a dream at the time, a dream suddenly turned black: sledgehammer from the sky, an immense roaring headache, the black noise of the end come too soon. So sorry; so sorry.<br><br><br/><br/>We think now that love is a kind of giving of attention. It is usually attention given to some other consciousness, but not always; the attention can be to something unconscious, even inanimate. But the attention seems often to be called out by a fellow consciousness. Something about it compels attention, and rewards attention. That attention is what we call love. Affection, esteem, a passionate caring. At that point, the consciousness that is feeling the love has the universe organized for it as if by kind of polarization. Then the giving is the getting.<br><br/><br/>Consciousness is so poorly understood that it can’t even be defined.  Self is an elusive thing, sought eagerly, grasped hard, perhaps in some kind of fear, some kind of desperate clutch after some first dim awareness, awareness even of sensory impressions, so that one might have something to hold to. To make time stop.  This is the source of the strong sense of self.  Perhaps.                                           Oh, such a halting problem in this particular loop of thought!  </i></blockquote>",,,1,0

(Only a very small part of the horror comes from Fussell - a sensitive perceptive Ivy League shoo-in - doing it.) The mental poverty of the lifter credo is yet another stricture.<br/><br/>You should not underestimate the psychological effects of exercise this intense. He becomes a swaggering, brutal loon within months; he stops doing anything at work:<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>at work my muscular behavior became a cause of concern on the floor. It was the general consensus that I had gone too far. Way too far. Some could understand the need to “fill out,” as I put it, and gain a few pounds. But two hour sessions in the morning and two more hours at night, five meals a day, vitamin supplements, and protein shakes?<br/>And if that wasn’t enough, well, there was the noise of my accouterments and the demands of my discipline. I installed an industrial-strength stainless steel blender in my cubicle for my shakes. I monopolized the floor’s sole refrigerator for my meats and milk and eggs, and continuously worked the microwave for a fresh feeding.<br/><br/>My cubicle, which I renamed The Growth Center, became a depot for desiccated beef liver tablets, multivitamin packs, bag after bag of branch-chain amino acids, cartons of Carboplex (a carbohydrate concentrate), and protein powder. What with the magazines and the canon scattered across the floor, the whole place was a muscle minefield, but I didn’t see it that way, not then. Not when I was caught in the full raging force of “the disease.”<br/><br/>... Childhood friends called me in consternation. Apparently, my folly was so spectacular, so profoundly perverse, that even they had gotten wind of it. It was worse, somehow, than enlisting in the Marines or buying finger cymbals and joining the Hare Krishnas.<br/><br/>... “Hasn’t it ever crossed your mind that this whole enterprise is rather vulgar? Is it your parents you want to hurt? Is that it? Is it your friends? Are you waiting for this to appear in the Alumni Notes? Goddamnit, why not do something with your life you can really be proud of?”<br/><br/>... “My physical metamorphosis had brought with it a completely different way of perceiving the world and my place in it... I had needed an attitude adjustment. And I don’t know exactly when the transformation happened—all I can say is that it did. Without being fully aware of it myself, I became the kind of man I had once feared and despised. I became, in fact, a bully...<br/><br/>Then, my manner of speech. It had been too tame before, too timid. No wonder I never got my way in life. I went from answering the phone meekly to shrieking “SPEAK!” into the receiver on the first ring<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>It’s extremely well written, tasteful and droll and honest, and rammed full of unusual detail. But something is missing.<br/><br/>How much of the spiritual effects were from weights, from pharmaceuticals, or from simply overloading a devotion to something, anything?<br/><br/>I lift, but never like this. I don’t think I do anything so intensely. I, my style and viewpoint, would not survive it.<br/><br/><a href=""https://bnjmnmddn.com/on-sam-fussell-s-muscle"">Lovely review by a scholar-lifter</a>",,,1,0

And everybody hates it, including the people nominally in power. How does <i>that</i> work? This book is his answer and is full of his usual sparkling sentences and big dubious historical claims:<br/><blockquote><i>The organization of the Soviet Union was directly modeled on that of the German postal service.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>He is sadly <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2434061627"">not to be trusted on technical matters</a> or in fact anything really contentious. But he's good on some other things.<br/><br/>He notes that corporate life is just as bureaucratic as the public sector, but that corporations are rarely called bureaucracies. This is important! He further notes that left-wing utopias tend to envision vastly stifling regulation and committees as their only lever against unfairness and abuse. <br/><br/>The book is slightly overegged - but compared to most anarchist social theory he is a model of rigour, epistemic care and systematic focus. In fact he is critical of his people's theorists and practitioners:<br/><blockquote><i>Foucault’s ascendancy in turn was precisely within those fields of academic endeavor that both became the haven for former radicals, but that were themselves most completely divorced from any access to political power, or increasingly, even to real social movements—which gave Foucault’s emphasis on the “power/knowledge” nexus, the assertion that forms of knowledge are always also forms of social power, indeed, the most important forms of social power, a particular appeal. <br><br>No doubt any such historical argument is a bit caricaturish and unfair; but I think there is a profound truth here. It is not just that we are drawn to areas of density, where our skills at interpretation are best deployed. We also have an increasing tendency to identify what’s interesting and what’s important, to assume places of density are also places of power. The power of bureaucracy shows just how much this is often not the case. </i></blockquote><br/>He yields too much to standpoint theory when he is told that they had similar ideas earlier (which he hadn't read and which they didn't put so clearly). But he's fun and witty, heretical to his tribe, original as always. <br/><br/><blockquote><i>...if we’re going to actually come up with robots that will do our laundry or tidy up the kitchen, we’re going to have to make sure that whatever replaces capitalism is based on a far more egalitarian distribution of wealth and power — one that no longer contains either the super-rich or desperately poor people willing to do their housework. Only then will technology begin to be marshaled toward human needs. And this is the best reason to break free of the dead hand of the hedge fund managers and the CEOs—to free our fantasies from the screens in which such men have imprisoned them, to let our imaginations once again become a material force in human history.</i></blockquote>",,,1,0

The narcotic dries fast, adhering to the tobacco. I light up and inhale deeply, listening to the wondrous crackling as the fire hits my lungs and the smoke hits my brain. Then the smoke clears and in the place where it was is now a picture.<br/><br/>A picture hung on the wall of our parlor. In it, a woman was taking a shirt from a clothesline. She had clothespins in her teeth and it was windy and a boy was tugging at her dress. The woman looked like she was in a hurry and the whole scene gave me the idea that, just outside the frame, full, dark clouds were gathering. But that was not what it was.<br/>It was paint.<br/>So I decided right then and there to see the picture as it really was. I stared at the thing long and hard, trying to only see the paint. But it was no use. All my eyes would allow me to see was the lie. In fact, the longer I gazed at the paint, the more false detail I began to imagine. The boy was crying, as if afraid, and the woman was weaker than I had first believed. I finally gave up. I understood then that it takes a powerful imagination to see a thing for what it really is.<br/><br/>...so I glanced back at the open door, where Old Jack stood, but his back was to me now and it was blocking out the light of the moon. I suddenly remembered that I’d read somewhere how the light of the moon was just an illusion and the moon was only a cold, cold stone. I watched Old Jack look from side to side before he turned his gaze on me, and his eyes flashed black like the wing of a crow. He closed the door and the inside of the shed went black.

Then where do I fit in?”<br/>I guess that would hurt most men—a guy you’ve known for twenty years asking what he gets when you toss away your soul in a Las Vegas hotel room—but I understand the ways of men, all right. Everybody’s in it for himself. Adam Eget’s just like everyone else. And my Plan B also takes care of him after I murder myself in cold blood.<br/>“You’re the one who finds me dead, and you cry and shake like a little girl, the way you just did a minute ago.

I might just walk out of the office.<br/>But I stayed put as Mr. Macdonald mercifully finished his “story.”<br/>“...and so, anyways, the point is I’ve never met an Eskimo I liked. Not once. Not ever. As a matter of fact I don’t think I’ve ever even met an Eskimo. I call them blubber-eaters, by the way.

We are both civilized men. You quit raping me right now and there’ll be no hard feelings. And you won’t see a reprisal rape outta me either, I promise you that.”</i></blockquote><br/><br/>The gambling sections are probably psychologically true, which I judge by how moving they are.<br/><blockquote><i>I remember a psychiatrist once telling me that I gamble in order to escape the reality of life, and I told him that’s why everyone does everything... why the attraction? Most people would think it’s the wins that keep the gambler going, but any gambler knows this is not true. As you place your chips on the craps table, you feel anxiety and impatience. When the red dice hit the green felt with a thunk and you’re declared the winner and the chips are pushed toward you, you feel relief. Relief is all. And relief is fine, but hardly what a man would give the whole rest of his life to gain. It has to be something else, and the best I’ve come up with is this: It is a particular moment. A magic moment that occurs after the placing of a bet and before the result of that bet. It is after the red dice are thrown but before they lie still on the green felt where they fall. It is when the dice are in the air, and as long as they are there, time stops. As long as the red dice are in the air, the gambler has hope. And hope is a wonderful thing to be addicted to.<br/>“Better luck next time, sir.""<br><br><br/><br/>...my chip denominations had climbed from the original five-dollar chip to a thousand-dollar chip, and finally, at about the hour mark, I was playing with the maximum five-thousand-dollar chip. The funny thing is, the five-dollar chip was the very same size as the five-thousand-dollar chip. Probably cost the same to make. But it was worth a thousand times more.<br/><br/>I was winning big time now. I began to feel an extraordinary transformation taking place deep within me, one that mirrored my chip’s transformation, for I felt myself double in value and then redouble and press to the maximum. I was the same exact size physically, and yet I was worth much more, a thousand times more, and that lingering suspicion that I might be a nobody was long gone. The Asian player rolled for twenty more minutes, and finally he rolled a seven and the run was over. Everyone cheered and I had a hundred eighteen thousand dollars in chips. I colored up, threw a fifty-dollar tip on the table, and left in perfect calm and elation, big as God inside</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Maybe the best showbiz memoir, but that's not saying much.",,,1,0

""<a href=""http://libraryofbabel.info/Borges/libraryofbabel.pdf"">Babel</a>"" is also horrifying in its way.) Playing at the limits of reason - without renouncing objectivity. (There is something of the unearthly drama and transcendence of higher mathematics in a couple of these stories.) Somehow it manages to be cryptic without being annoying, to use literary gossip and the droning of archivists straight. Some of this is 80 years old, and it's still completely fresh.<br/><br/>He makes literature larger, by bringing new things into scope - bibliographic minutiae, English department arcana, salon gossip. There's something refreshing about his perfect fake book reviews. Gushing praise of nonexistent authors draws back the veil (as if our world's reviewers would say the same things whether or not the authors existed). <br/><br/>Borges was not a postmodernist but these anyway have the best of what postmodernism is taken to mean: nonliteral play, generative scepticism about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference"">sense and reference</a> and language-games, reasoning about the limits of reason.<br/><br/>I'm not sure of the significance of some of Borges' sentences here. But for once the critic's working assumption of meaning seems sound: if I thought about it, I could find out. (And not just in the ordinary way, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia"">by projection</a>. I expect to find <i>Borges</i> in them if I try.)<br/><br/>I've some ideas about each story, but none that fit completely or exhaust them. Here's one:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Here's a banal idea: ""language is composite"". Characters go into words into sentences into works into worldviews. In ""The Library of Babel"", Borges stretches this fact until you see the horror in it, the <a href=""http://www.singularitysymposium.com/exponential-growth.html"">shocking</a> vastness of exponentiation on the tiny scale of a human life. The simple idea of mechanically generating all strings of length <i>n=1,312,000</i> leads to an incredibly claustrophobic closed system. The story is not 8 pages long but contains more than most books.<br/><br/>There exists one truth; there are uncountably many falsehoods; but worse, there's a far larger infinity of nonsense, of things which make sense in no language, which don't make enough sense to be false, which never will. This is the horror of Platonism or Many-world physics or Meinong: that we could be invisibly boxed-in by garbled infinities, endless keyboard mashing. The ""noosphere"" - all the good ideas, all the bad ideas ever had - is a tiny pocket of meaning in a sea of meaninglessness.<br/><br/>The stunning effect of ""Babel"" depends on its not being magic, not hand-wavy (merely monstrous, physically impossible for interesting reasons which violate no particular law). Ted Chiang is grasping at a similar titanic scale when he uses a truly alien language <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/Story-Of-Your-Life"">to explain variational physics</a>.<br/><br/>Remember that Borges was a librarian. But, while he said <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7572-i-have-always-imagined-that-paradise-will-be-a-kind"">photogenic things</a> about libraries, he didn't necessarily like being in them. ""The Library of Babel"" adds an extremely mordant overtone to that quotation, by imagining an otherworldly library which breaks men just by being there. Sturrock, his biographer:<br/><blockquote><i>    Borges had some reason to dislike libraries because for nine years ""of solid unhappiness"", from 1937 to 1946, he was obliged to work in one, as a quite junior librarian, in order to make money. The cataloguing work he did was futile... </blockquote></i><br/><br/>The alphabet used for the Babel books has 22 letters and no uppercase. We could try and look up human languages with that many letters, but better to take this as a hint that our narrator is <i>not us</i> - he can be a total alien, far from Earth, and the exact same library will still confound him the exact same way. The same geometry constrains all minds. What looks like meaning need not be, if your sample is large enough:<br/><blockquote><i>This useless and wordy epistle itself already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves in one of the uncountable heaxgons - and so does its refutation. (And <i>n</i> possible languages make use of the <i>same</i> vocabulary; in some of them the symbol 'library' admits of the correct definition 'ubiquitous and everlasting system of hexagonal galleries', but 'library' is 'bread' or 'pyramid' of anything else... You who read me, are you sure you understand my language?) <br/></blockquote></i><br/>The narrator says that the fall from his floor ""<i>is infinite</i>"" (or indefinite), that the rooms are ""<i>uncountable</i>"", but we can do better than this quite easily, given only the text. There are 410*40*80 = 1312000 characters per book. The number of distinct books is thus (22 + 3)^{1312000} or about 2 followed by about 1.8 million zeroes. It is hard to give a reference for how large this is: if every atom in the universe contained as many atoms as are in the universe (10^80), and each of the nested atoms was a Babel book, this would still contain only a laughably tiny fraction of Babel, less than one googolplexth. There's 4*5*32 = 640 books per hexagon, so we need about 3 x 10^1834094 room-sized hexagons. This is the full implication of the simple thought ""every book of length 1312000"".<br/><br/>It couldn't possibly be even fractionally built. And yet, through the power of maths, <a href=""http://libraryofbabel.info/book.cgi?0-w1-s1-v17:1"">it has been built</a> - ""only implicitly, skeletally"", but it still counts.<br/><br/>(Borges notes this infinity/finity conflict on the last page, explaining that the Library is unbounded and periodic, a hypersphere.)<br/><br/>There is a beautiful, inspiring lesson to be taken from it actually: think about what the incredible feat of writing any book - no matter how bad - actually entails. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function"">Our nervous system</a> shields us from Babel, from the larger part of possible meanings and the overwhelming majority of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)"">string</a> space.

All of this becomes considerably easier when we allow ourselves the luxury of working with infinitesimals. We need no longer, as in the 1950’s, blush to say “the i-word”.

He's most famous for techno body horror, but his historical fantasies and economic stories are distinct and equally good. In fact I think his Exotic (But Non-Japanese) Cyberpunk is probably his key style. Here’s his Balkan SF, roadside kiosk as vanguard of the future:<br/><blockquote><i>These strangers and foreigners expressed odd, truncated, malformed ideas of what he had been doing. Because they were the Voice of History.<br/><br/>He himself had no such voice to give to history. He came from a small place under unique circumstances. People who hadn’t lived there would never understand it. Those who had lived there were too close to understand it. There was just no understanding for it. There were just…the events. Events, transitions, new things. Things like the black kiosks…<br/><br/>To the neighborhood, to the people, he was a crippled, short-tempered old landlord. To her, the scholar-bureaucrat, he was a mysterious figure of international significance. Her version of events was hopelessly distorted and self-serving. But it was a version of events. </i></blockquote><br/>This stuff is harder than it looks. Witness the many laughably dated K00L stories of the 90s. (Gibson.) This is dated, but it's not the tech or the slang that does it. It's the excitement about the internet as ontological shift, about cultural hybridisation, postmodern whoah; also the urgent grappling with Islamic philosophy and politics. (I shouldn't say 'dated'; matured.)<br/><br/>Sterling prefigures half of recent SF. We have a grand, mindless, terrifyingly efficient foil (a la Watts), a profiteering parasite civ (Pohl, Vinge), a genetically labile bodysnatcher (Tchaikovsky, Corey), early modern magic realism (Chiang, Borges), colonialism and cosmopolitanism as the original first contact (Stephenson), Western ideology as alien (Chiang), a paean to the technician and the technologist (Stephenson, Gibson), antihuman technologies (Gibson, Stross, Watts), even boringly transcendent evaporation as natural endpoint of conscious life (Banks).

You naively suppose that you can continue to feed your curiosity indefinitely. It is an old story, pursued by countless races before you. Within a thousand years—perhaps a little longer—your species will vanish.”<br/>“You intend to destroy us, then? I warn you it will not be an easy task—”<br/>“Again you miss the point… Do you suppose that fragile little form of yours—your primitive legs, your ludicrous arms and hands, your tiny, scarcely wrinkled brain—can contain all that power? Certainly not! Already your race is flying to pieces under the impact of your own expertise. The original human form is becoming obsolete. Your own genes have been altered, and you, Captain-Doctor, are a crude experiment. In a hundred years you will be a relic. In a thousand years you will not even be a memory. Your race will go the same way as a thousand others.” <br/>…<br/><br/>Stone-faced children wandered aimlessly through suburban halls, dazed on mood suppressants. Precious few dared to care any longer. Sweating Marketeers collapsed across their keyboards, sinuses bleeding from inhalants.

It contains four or five intellectual feints. It's about the communitarian appeal, and the individualist appeal.<br/><blockquote><i>“Here at least people really care and watch over each other…”<br/>She gritted her teeth. “Watching. Yes, always.” </i></blockquote><br/> It's a presumptive decoding of Malay culture. (“<i>The Bruneians, like Malays everywhere, adored ghost stories.</i>”) It's a great love story, a modern romance, a particular male romance. One character, initially depicted as decrepit and ridiculous, turns out to be a revolutionary colossus. Turner makes a grand conversion to human-centred technology, Gross National Happiness kind of stuff - and then this conversion is immediately subverted. The plot is driven by conveniences and I don't care at all. <br/><br/>The women worked on, wrapped in the lamp’s mild glow. Innocently, they enjoyed themselves, secure in their usefulness. Yet Turner knew machines could have done the sewing faster and easier. Already, through fishing smacks, as he watched, some corner of his mind pulled the task to computerized pieces, thinking: simplify, analyze, reduce.<br/><br/>But to what end?… People in the West talked about the “technical elite”—and Turner knew it was a damned lie. Technology roared on, running full-throttle on the world’s last dregs of oil, but no one was at the wheel, not really… “The “technical elite” were errand boys. They didn’t decide how to study, what to work on, where they could be most useful, or to what end. Money decided that. Technicians were owned by the abstract ones and zeros in bankers’ microchips, paid out by silk-suit hustlers who’d never touched a wrench. Knowledge wasn’t power, not really, not for engineers. There were too many abstractions in the way. </i></blockquote><br/><br/>(Why is eight million regarded as a fortune of global renown though? Eight million what? CAD??)<br/><br/>—-<br/><br/>‘<i>Magic Shop</i>’ is great fun. Initially it looks like a great gag: a fantasy protagonist with no interest in mysteries, treasures, princesses, vengeance, or Journeys.<br/><br/>Later:<br/><blockquote><i>O’Beronne gave him a poisonous glare. “You’re a hundred and forty years old. Hasn’t the burden of unnatural life become insupportable?”<br/>James looked at him, puzzled. “Are you kidding?” </i></blockquote><br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>A couple of these stories make me queasy. This is hard to do!<br/><br/>Part of this is Sterling's habit of having horrible narrators. One is an Islamist assassin, and his ideology is so galling because it is not only false (e.g. Western perfidy in Iran). I realised only halfway through that the old label for Sterling was ""postmodern"". It says something that that label has become so marginal and forgettable in the last 10 years.<br/><br/>The <a href=""http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?25873"">Starlitz</a> stories are particularly strong. Starlitz is like Stross' Manfred Macx - an agent of the future - but in a curious amoral way. He runs guns for the Russian mafia and for psychotic Finnish nationalists. He lusts over trends and capital and flashy collectibles. He embodies the future <i>but not progress</i>: change in a nonmoral sense.<br/><br/>The undergrad revolutionary Aino is very tragic. Her mind is totally consumed by post-Marxist revolutionary fervour - but Marxism without hope, the nationalist perversion of the International. I recognise her, her inhumane mind-killed purity. it breaks my heart.<br/><blockquote><i>I I envy her historical experience so much. There’s something so direct and healthy and physical about hijacking planes. </i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>'Maneki Neko' is an exquisite portrait of networks, the gift economy, and another sweet vision of a kind of digital culture we haven't gotten yet. Replace money with a terrible god who can solve the problem of double coincidence. Also the brutality and inexorability of '<a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/"">Elua</a>'. (The cat thing is also an egregore, of course. How better to overthrow a government than to charm literally everyone and destroy its tax base?)<br/><br/>—-<br/><br/>Excellent pastiche of cranks (Prigogine is an antishibboleth):<br/><blockquote><i>I sniffed at the phenethylamine, the body’s own “natural” amphetamine. I felt suddenly dizzy, as if the space inside my head were full of the red-hot Ur-space of the primordial de Sitter cosmos, ready at any moment to make the Prigoginic leap into the “normal” space-time continuum, the Second Prigoginic Level of Complexity… <br/><br/>“We’re past the Marxist thing,” said Khoklov, warming to his theme as the pill took hold. “Now it’s different. This time Russia has a kind of craziness that is truly big enough and bad enough to take over the whole world. Massive, total, institutional corruption: Top to bottom: Nothing held back. A new kind of absolute corruption that will sell anything: the flesh of our women, the future of our children. Everything inside our museums and our churches. Anything goes for money: gold, oil, arms, dope, nukes. We’ll sell the soil and the forests and the Russian sky. We’ll sell our souls.”<br/><br/>“Any system of rational analysis must live within the strong blind body of mass humanity, Mr. Dertouzas.

Bill Weaver:<br/><blockquote><i>Without proper scheduling, disturbances inside the inlet could result in the shock wave being expelled forward—a phenomenon known as an “inlet unstart”... An immediate unstart occurred on the right engine, forcing the aircraft to roll further right and start to pitch up. I jammed the control stick as far left and forward as it would go.<br/>No response. I instantly knew we were in for a wild ride.<br/>I attempted to tell Jim what was happening and to stay with the airplane until we reached a lower speed and altitude. I don’t think the chances of surviving an ejection at Mach 3.18 and 78,800 ft. were very good. However, g-forces built up so rapidly that my words came out garbled and unintelligible, as confirmed later by the cockpit voice recorder... Everything seemed to unfold in slow motion. I learned later the time from event onset to catastrophic departure from controlled flight was only two to three seconds. Still trying to communicate with Jim, I blacked out, succumbing to extremely high g-forces.<br/>Then the SR-71... literally disintegrated around us...<br/>Before the breakup, we’d started a turn in the New Mexico-Colorado-Oklahoma-Texas border region. The SR-71 had a turning radius of about a hundred miles at that speed and altitude, so I wasn’t even sure what state we were going to land in...<br/>Extracting myself from the parachute harness, I discovered the source of those flapping-strap noises heard on the way down. My seat belt and shoulder harness were still draped around me, attached and latched. The lap belt had been shredded on each side of my hips, where the straps had fed through knurled adjustment rollers. The shoulder harness had shredded in a similar manner across my back. The ejection seat had never left the airplane; I had been ripped out of it by the extreme forces, seat belt and shoulder harness still fastened. I also noted that one of the two lines that supplied oxygen to my pressure suit had come loose, and the other was barely hanging on...<br/>Parts were scattered over an area approximately fifteen miles long and ten miles wide. Extremely high air loads and g-forces, both positive and negative, had literally ripped Jim and me from the airplane. Unbelievably good luck is the only explanation for my escaping relatively unscathed from that disintegrating aircraft.<br/><br/>Two weeks after the accident, I was back in an SR-71, flying the first sortie on a brand-new bird...</i></blockquote>",,,1,0

What if capitalism is unstable, and socialism is impossible? </i></blockquote><br/><br/>As a result, the main conflict in this is not socialism vs capitalism (the ancap zone is the nicest place in the book) but progress vs primitivism and resistance vs (American and UN) empire<br/><blockquote><i>There were times when Kohn loathed the Left, when some monstrous stupidity almost, but never quite, outweighed the viciousness and venality of the system they opposed. Ally with the barbarians against the patricians and praetorians… think again, proletarians!… His co-op had lived by defending what he still saw as the seeds of progress – the workers’ organizations and the scientists and, if necessary, the capitalists – against the enemies of that modern industry on which all their conflicting hopes relied…<br/><br/>(She’d often wondered just what molecule or compound was responsible for hysteria and ineducability in the middle classes: it must have seeped into the food-chain sometime in the nineteen-sixties, and become ever more concentrated since.)<br/><br/>‘Fuck them and their nazi economics.’ He punched his palm. ‘Protection.

She knew this was exactly how people would feel just before the real apocalypse, that nearly everyone who’d faced some intrusive threat to their everyday existence – war, revolution, genocide, purges, disaster – had faced it with the firm conviction that things like this just didn’t happen or didn’t happen here or didn’t happen to people like them. But she also knew there would be no end of false alarms, lying wonders, false prophets with a Lo! here and a Hi! there, before whatever the real thing was came along. Indeed, they were part of the reason why the real thing always came like a thief in the night or… like a secret policeman in the early hours of the morning.</i> </blockquote><br/><br/>There are limits to Macleod’s scepticism. Trotsky looms large here as a wise prophet (never mind his own peasant-murdering and purely opportunistic democratic pivot).<br/><blockquote><i>‘I can see the bright green strip of grass beneath the wall, and a clear blue sky above the wall, and sunlight everywhere. Life is beautiful. Let the future generations cleanse it of all evil, oppression and violence, and enjoy it to the full.’<br/>The gentle words, harshly spoken in a polyglot accent, made Kohn’s eyes sting.<br/>‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘We haven’t done very well.’<br/>The Old Man laughed. ‘You are not the future! You – you are only the present.’</i></blockquote><br/><spoiler>And the revolution wins, brutal and repressive as it instantly becomes.</spoiler><br/><br/>Also notable for a negative portrayal of Archipelago, voluntary ideological nations with exit rights. The only real critique is that they war on each other all the time (millions of deaths a year), and indoctrinate their subjects so that people don’t exercise their exit rights.

Here is one of the most important people to ever live, and what notice do we take? Before now: One bad old biography (and <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29506.Prisoner_s_Dilemma"">one-third</a> of another) and many gigantic maths monographs. Such yawning gaps come from historians and biographers being obsessed with artists instead - consider the nine Jane Austen biographies published in the last 11 years - and our scientists being inarticulate at best. unable or unwilling to stand up for themselves, and unrepresented by the chattering classes. (But a handful of scientists are great writers: Feynman and Dyson and Dawkins and Crick and Pascal and yeah Einstein is quotable and I was actually boggling at some of Gödel’s aphorisms just the other day. Boltzmann is funny.)<br/><br/>It is incredibly difficult to cover everything von Neumann did - everything he did for the first time in history - even just everything with vast practical consequences which are still felt 60 years later. <br/><br/>Chapter 2: fixing set theory where Hilbert and Russell failed<br/>Chapter 3: unifying matrix and wave theory where Dirac bodged and others failed<br/>Chapter 4: solution to a profound engineering challenge which changed the world forever<br/><br/>Great philosophers get several kinds of books written about them - two are the Life, and the intellectual biography, which actually tries to explain and show the development of their ideas.

Bhattacharya, in 284, is not even vaguely able to begin doing this for vN.

Why did they stop? von Neumann’s own answer was the empire’s weird mix of 1) tolerance and rewards for Jewish people, while 2) still being extremely volatile and so making them uncertain how long this would last and so rushing to succeed.<br/><br/>* Bhattacharya’s informalisation of the technical results here is impressive. At least one fuckup though: on p112 he confuses completeness for correctness.<br/><br/>* At one point AB ties the Hilbert and Gödel work to modernism. Modernist mathematics, the rejection of the past, the flight into abstraction and rigour. As if this was a general spirit. I don’t know how to evaluate this idea.<br/><br/>* Sad to hear that a heavily modified ENIAC executed a stored program two months before the Manchester Baby. I hate to see the Man win over the garage nerds.<br/><br/>* Nash is nasty, well before he goes psychotic (self-aggrandising, straw Vulcan, racist). He makes von Neumann look soft and warm.<br/><br/>* Lovelace is not the first programmer. Klári von Neumann has a much better claim, if we insist on ignoring Babbage.<br/><br/>* So many brilliant people here, and far more obscure than JvN. Shapley, Barricelli, Collbohm, Goldstine, Harsanyi, McCarthy, Adele and Klári…<br/><br/>—-<br/><br/>We tend to deify people, and they never deserve it. What did von Neumann get wrong?<br/><br/><b>Mutually Assured Destruction</b><br/>It's not obvious that this was a mistake - we're still here, MAD is a strong reason not to intentionally nuke people. But the sheer number of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls"">near misses</a> and the overall estimate of <a href=""https://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/blog/post/less-hollywood-more-car-crash"">0.1%</a> annual state risk, should make us think that the strategy was actually poor, that we are walking selection bias. <br/>The less obvious response is that he knew all that and was trading some existential risk to block the Soviet Empire's anti-human practices from taking over. Since this argument also works for the Soviets, or for any value system which values itself, he seems to have settled for an appalling equilibrium. Tragedy of the value lock-in commons.<br/><br/>VN wanted cooperation, wanted a long life for humanity. But he couldn’t trust enough not to escalate. The true altruist cannot afford to cooperate simply.<br/><br/><b>First strike on the Soviets</b><br/><blockquote><i>If you say 'why not bomb them tomorrow', I say, why not today? If you say 'today at five o'clock', I say why not one o'clock?</i></blockquote>(He recanted this a couple of years later.)<br/><br/>The mistake was twofold: to assume that the Soviets would continue growing, and to assume that the nuclear taboo would not hold. That taboo, that tradition is one of the most precious things in the world, and almost nothing is worth breaking it. To which you reply: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism#Estimated_number_of_victims"">100 million people</a> are not worth it? To which I can only apologise and suggest that 100 million are not worth 300 million.<br/><br/><br/><b>Trusting Klaus Fuchs</b><br/>He actually handed the Soviets a new nuke design through the infamous Fuchs.<br/><br/><br/>Nonerror: <b>""Proof"" of no hidden variables</b><br/>The conventional view is that von Neumann screwed up his no-hidden-variables proof,  claimed to have shown the impossibility of hidden variables, and that this convinced everyone until Bell came along and exposed the error (30 years after Grete Hermann did it and was ignored). But <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0499"">this</a> <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09305.pdf"">misrepresents the proof</a>, which just says that a hidden variables theory will have to have a certain weird structure (which Bohmian mechanics does).<br/><br/><b>Targeting Kyoto</b><br/>I don't know if a nuclear strike on Japan was ultimately for the best (considering the appalling toll of the Pacific theatre on both sides, the likely larger toll of taking Honshū, and the second-order effects of showing the world that everything had changed). But that they were <i>civilian</i> strikes seems completely gratuitous. Striking Kyoto, the spiritual centre, in particular seems incredibly high risk.<br/><br/>Nonerror: <b>The brain is digital</b><br/>People act like he was naive about the brain as computer, but he just wasn’t:<br/><blockquote><i>the brain can prima facie be considered as a digital computer. However, upon further reflection, some elements of analog computing (e.g., the chemistry) will also become relevant in understanding the functioning of the brain.</i></blockquote><br/><br/><b>The von Neumann bottleneck</b><br/>The world standard architecture for computers leads to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture#Von_Neumann_bottleneck"">a huge waste of CPU cycles</a>, waiting for memory. This wasn't such a big deal in the 50s, but CPU performance has masssively outpaced bus bandwidth over the last 70 years.<br/><br/><b>Against high-level programming</b><br/>'von Neumann opposed the development of assemblers and high-level language compilers. He preferred to employ legions of human programmers (mostly low-paid graduate students) to hand-assemble code into machine language. “It is a waste of a valuable scientific computing instrument”, von Neumann reportedly said, “to use it to do clerical work.”.'<br/><br/><b>Various dumb personal risks</b><br/>He did not live like someone who understood expected utility and hyperbolic discounting. He ate way too much, drove incredibly badly, was an easy mark for salesmen, pissed off his wife by leching. He spent a lot of time travelling to government meetings. He let others profit from his inventions. These imply irrationality - or a surprising lack of interest in his own wealth, longevity, time use, or marriage. <a href=""https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com/2019/10/26/some-notes-on-von-neumann-as-a-human-being/"">This post collects other apparently bad decisions.</a><br/><br/>—-",,,1,0

That wait would be fatal in a first book, but everyone who makes it here, to book four, has proven hardier and will eat it gladly.<br/><br/>Not a lot of war in this war novel before then. Instead, a Hufflepuff hum - faint in previous books, risen in this one. I don’t mean to be mean: the philosophical principle that nice things are important, philosophically rich is one of mine. But 9A, the narrator, is too much the overgrown child. They say “snugglier”. They emphasise snacking. Someone cries in every chapter I think. Like Odysseus. They also rave against free speech (though Palmer is a historian of censorship and should not be identified with 9A). <br/><br/>Neotene domesticity is all very well for Becky Chambers, but it doesn’t gel with the other gigantic aesthetic banners of this work (the Enlightenment consummated and their language appropriated; a society transformed, deluding itself to be peaceful; the ideological roots of conflict, the inexorability of war’s logic, thus this realistic war between lovers and friends).<br/><br/>The achievement of this book - besides the truly baroque prose, the truly insane narration - is that it nearly succeeds in making every faction <i>reasonable</i>. Uncertainty justifies terrible things, the most terrible: distrust, surveillance, subterfuge, war.<br/><spoiler>Palmer slips a few times. Kosala freaking out and blowing up the Almagest ex ante doesn’t change anything; Utopia-Mason already have the Alexander, space weapons. Moreover, her killing MASON is bound to kill many more people, and she’s not a consequentialist. I cover the great emptiness of Brillist anti-exploration in the spoiler below.</spoiler><br/>I can’t remember this being done so well. Maybe in Hugo or Dumas.<br/><br/>I am a big fan, but, so I dislike a lot about this series. I find the central conflict arbitrary, and the central psychological claim wrong. Actually maybe I just dislike the Ninth Anonymous, puppy Odysseus. <br/><br/>—-<br/><br/>* Meme: “in the grim darkness of the C25th, mankind has divided into the elemental archetypes: jock, fash, hufflepuff, freud, stemlord, landlord, libertarian, people with a country of origin instead of a personality”. (This is no critique of Palmer when we remember that all such groupings will arise through weird partially random historical contingencies: the resulting categories don’t need to make sense and probably won’t.)<br/><br/>* Common bit of silliness: <blockquote><i>“…languages are precious enough to be worth people dying for. A human life has infinite value, infinite consequences over the universe of space-time, but apparently They think a language is another order of infinity.”</i></blockquote> Piety. I can’t think of any language worth anyone dying for.<br/><br/><spoiler>In fact naive infinite ethics is the root of the conflict. Gordian says each human mind is infinite and so infinitely valuable; Utopia says the light cone is larger if not infinite. Jedd in the middle goes hmmm yeah can't see anything wrong with treating each person as equally valuable with a universe full of people, what a moral puzzle.</spoiler><br/><br/>* I like the Renaissance conceit of calling god The Great Author, and Jedd's conceit of calling the Utopians ""small authors"", small gods. Later, this is expanded into a huggy thing where all humans are small authors - in the afterword Palmer implies more: that we're all obeying the Utopian oath by working so much as 40 hours a week. I honour this thought - for instance a cleaner is in fact doing something of moral significance when they work, is in fact imperceptibly pulling on the rope that leads to the future. But it's a piety to say that all stories are equal-sized, that all pull the same. <br/><blockquote><i>Many have described to me the journey from feeling they could never maintain such a high standard to realizing that we already are.</i></blockquote><br/>No, there is more to do.<br/><br/>* So many hundreds of details, like the Brillist / Gordian double name (ideology and instantiation). Recalls GNU / Linux. The verisimilitude of mess.<br/><br/>* The office of Anonymous doesn’t make sense. Has there ever been a writer who successfully spoke for humanity? Is solving epistemic logic puzzles really the only qualification you want for such a person?<br/><br/>* The stable stagnation following the exponential age seems pretty implausible. Then there's the laughable smallness of the AI threat - one serial killer(!). (I suppose Utopia solved AI alignment. But then set-sets would have to be obsolete, unless the other Hives hated U-beasts, which they don't seem to.)<br/><br/>* There’s a moving sequence about chronic fatigue, also one of Palmer’s personal crosses. Wheelchair as throne.<br/><br/>* The book takes a slightly absurd view of the wisdom and effectiveness and moral stature of the UN. Maybe they get better over 400 years of irrelevance.<br/><br/>* The plot is excessive, and I think it's intentionally difficult to track all the threads. Fine, but one bit goes too far for me: <spoiler>Achilles' dying speech implies alternate timelines and him as a multiverse hopper. And this in turn makes Palmer’s god less stupid, if he is the multiverse maximiser, <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/01/the-hour-i-first-believed/"">the only theodicy</a> I find even vaguely satisfying. Palmer's mainline theodicy is different: the universe is the offering of a blind mute god who wants to talk to a solipsist god. It's pretty cool.</spoiler><br/><br/>* The main characters spend lots of their most critical resources on documentation, history monging. Sniper’s chapter is bought at extreme expense, Mycroft’s whole shtick… This is <i>sorta</i> realistic - militaries have war artists and official bookworms. But it’s not usually the commanders and chief strategists scribbling for posterity as the death squads stalk their corridors. Palmer uses epistolary devices to great effect, but I find myself wishing they’d focus on the war for a sec.<br/><br/>* I like the Mitsubishi a lot more in this one. <spoiler>disregarding their purported sadism in Mycroft’s literally hallucinated odyssey.</spoiler> Palmer makes me notice that the rich are a minority. Less vulnerable than the others, but there's a high floor to the vulnerability of any small group.<br/><br/>* a bit of body horror and mind rape, be warned. <spoiler>Largely unpunished</spoiler><br/><br/>* The novel could do without religion. Jedd could be a vast noble alien, and we would have no need for This World’s Creator or even Bridger. <spoiler>The relics are Faust’s stated casus belli but others are easy to imagine.</spoiler> The narrators’ abjection before Jedd makes their tweeness worse. If there’s a god, you should wrestle him, not kneel. I could do without the extended <spoiler><i>Iliad</i> plot mirroring too.</spoiler><br/><br/>* Yet another fundamental problem: <spoiler>Jedd is not actually morally superior, which is why I don't like people kneeling to him. Absolute caring is not actually the perfect morality. He beats the monsters and Kosala and beautiful primitive Mason, but not Huxley. This is stupid for instance:<br/><blockquote><i>Some occupations, mainly medical, may be judged too essential to subtract from, but for the rest, even the most important projects in the world”—tremble, Utopia and Gordian—“we must give up a portion of what would have been our life’s works to restore what we can of the devastated life’s works of the dead</i></blockquote><br/>Postponing a death from heart attack is essential, but preventing deaths from aging isn't?? A debt to the past is lexicographically above all present and future people??<br/><br/>He <i>is</i> good at cutting knots, removing the bizarre theory-blind fatalism of the Censor, Gordian, the Mardis, and even Utopia. Nothing like the stupidity of a group with an overfit predictive model.<br/><br/>I understand why there's no retribution in the aftermath of the war - the hugginess wins - but there's not even any proportionality. Utopia suffers more than Gordian!<br/><br/><blockquote><i>No repercussions, then, for Gordian’s deceit? They get it all, even their collaboration, Bridger’s relics shared, thy Jehovah’s great wealth shared with the twin projects? That does not feel like justice.<br/><br/>It does not feel like goddess Nemesis, reader, who ravages the guilty, paying pain with pain. It feels like something better.</i></blockquote>This shows an unreasonable level of trust in Faust; if someone commits mass murder and mind rape once, you should expect them to do it again. By all means let them work on great projects for the world they defiled. But defang them first, and watch them.</spoiler><br/><br/>* The Masons are shown as heroic and vast in numbers, and yet they seem most of the way to fascism. With one bad MASON, they could ruin everything. Their superiority complex, retributive deontology, lack of individualism, and willing lack of freedom, are in far more severe contradiction to the Hive Alliance than the conflicts Palmer chooses to emphasise. Cornel is a liberal tyrant and a longtermist, and so they do good despite their terrible potential. (It’s not just their power - Utopia is powerful too. It’s the sheer lack of checks.) I wish I could say I find it unrealistic for a billion people to larp full-time as a Roman pleb or Mussolinian. <spoiler>Palmer knows all this and nerfs them in the denouement.</spoiler><br/><br/>* This book will age better than most, but parts of it ring trendy, sarky, Whedony. <spoiler>Like the reservationists coming out of nowhere to save the day.</spoiler> The bold, unclichéd treatment of gender of past books - as gravity, as a seductive force that can be covered up but not ignored, dimorphism as transgression, feminine arts as mind control, pronouns as a spicy personality marker. <br/><blockquote><i>Their comportment invites it, that toxic artificial helplessness that coded feminine in olden days, and makes us all fall over ourselves wanting to do things for Heloïse, so much so that we stifle when they try to do things for themself.</i></blockquote><br/>Here it gives way to a soppy constructionism, gender as conspiracy:<br/><spoiler><blockquote><i> Madame toiled fifty years—fifty!—to revive patriarchy, narrowing the gates and cramming all high offices she could with the prey this mantis matriarch found easiest, all masculine in mind and genitalia… The Big Three leading this World War: matron Danaë, nursing Lesley, me, and not a dick among us. Where are they now, Madame? The artificial creatures, stiff and male and defined by their penises, you said would rise once war dispelled our supposedly fake equality?</i></blockquote> Well, you did contrive two dozen of your own male characters to coincidentally fall, to yield this panel. (She returns to the interesting moderate view in the great denouement.)</spoiler><br/><br/>—-<br/><br/>But the main gripe:<br/><br/><spoiler>The Gordian / Utopian split, the heart if the whole series, is not at all crisp. Earth vs Space. In vs Out. Unity vs fragmentation. Variety vs far greater variety. Life extension vs space exploration. Just let the ones who want to stay stay! People often pose life extension and space exploration as opposites, but they just aren’t, and so they are an unsuitable pair to base thousands of pages of conflict upon. I can’t take Faust seriously when he arbitrarily prefers current people to all of the thousands of worlds’ worth of people that space exploration would bring. He misses the great daily loss of entire galaxies, lost forever. He says he wants ems, which could pack the earth denser with minds. Well consider the greater packing of galaxies full of ems! The only way it makes sense is if they’re selfish, scrabbling to keep themselves alive. His war, his terrorism, is thus rooted in repeated errors, and the books are rooted in his war. I cannot love this.<br/><br/>How to have them clash deeply? Make Utopia pro-death! Science advances by funerals!</spoiler><br/><br/><spoiler>In fact almost no part of Brillism makes sense. They hate set-sets for reducing natural personality and cognitive variety. But every set character we see is different from the others - and different from all natural characters! Sets are strictly increasing the variety of humanity. There’s nothing wrong with depicting bad philosophy, but it’s presented as a serious dilemma and I don’t think Palmer thinks Brillism is mistaken, just ruined by extremism and instrumental harm.</spoiler><br/><br/>That said, nearly all the main characters are Explorers, taking one side.<br/><br/>What would I have as the war’s great theme? The one from the last book is fantastic and underemphasised here: faith in a benevolent dictator vs pragmatic, aggressive scepticism. The second? Past-regarders and future-regarders. Long reflection vs Builders. Noble lie vs radical honesty. Bioconservatism vs transhumanism (represented already, a little). Theory vs praxis. Academia vs autodidacts. Stamp collecting vs engineering. All better than the chosen <spoiler>inwards vs out.</spoiler><br/><br/>What about Jedd’s philosophy? Like Yahweh, he has serious problems with respecting boundaries. That his subsumption and illiberal eternal hugging is taken so seriously is annoying. His lack of socialisation is half stupidity (demanding unconditional surrender at the cost of millions of lives), half defamiliar genius (why do people die, father?). <spoiler>That he is a particularist, favouring his family to the point where this has a serious chance of outweighing every other being and the course of history he chooses, belies his being particularly alien or godlike. Kin favourites is classic mammal.<br/></spoiler><br/><br/>One more deep disagreement: <spoiler>the war is said to be needed because humans are growing too comfortable to go to deep space. But this seems completely backwards to me. Just as a small minority of people in the richest parts of the world strain unprecedentedly without needing to - marathons, free soloing, biohacking, psychonautics, workaholism, and yes, space - I expect greater wealth and tech to inspire a similar proportion of contrarian strivers. And it only takes a few hundred offworld to seed all else. This is Utopia’s bizarre error / overconfidence, or Palmer’s error which makes itself true for them. Gordian have no blame in it, it’s enough for Utopia to believe it.</spoiler><br/><br/><spoiler>Cato as Hephaestus, the divine inventor, yields a funny insight: all of this could have been avoided with sufficient technological progress. Can everyone have what they want, with sufficient technological progress? No, but it gets you pretty close.</spoiler><br/><br/>And yet I am so glad. There is nothing like it in C21st literature. I am only able to attack its philosophy (philosophies) because it’s so clearly and sympathetically drawn, because so intellectually ambitious. I am certain there are readers out there who view Utopia as trivially wrong, though it’s hard to imagine anyone loving <spoiler>terrorist Gordian. They’re from Ingolstad!</spoiler> <br/><br/>Characters routinely do the reasonable thing, including positive-sum trades with their mortal enemies, including instrumental harm for enormous stakes. It is one of the few works which sees the full stakes so clearly, which sees the world-historical significance of nerds, science fiction, and technical tat, both beneath and beyond the average novelist.<br/><br/>Over-the-top, wrong, and great.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Clippings:<br/><blockquote><i>I could see you, across the sky, the crowded sea, a thousand black and winged shapes for every tardy, well-meant Peace-dove. But humans began digging a canal across the Gulf of Corinth more than three thousand years ago and finished it in 1893. It’s worth trying things again. Apollo Guardian of Strangers knows that it’s worth trying things again. Especially for such a goal as peacefall.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/><spoiler><blockquote>Why not both, Mycroft?<br/><i>A week ago, I could not have answered you, reader, but now I think I can. The light is almost out. Space is too terrible, and Earth too good, not only space too hard but Earth too good, the gifts of Nature, more, for we have spent this hundred thousand years not only building boats and braving seas but tilling fields and planting cities, cultivating Earth’s great human garden. Even in the Exponential Age, when we wounded Mother Gaea with our garbage and our growth, we coaxed her back to health. Perhaps with Master Hobbes still there beside you, you imagine struggles are a constant of humanity’s condition, but our ancestors worked hard to make a better future for their children, and it worked. Life now is good. Not just for most, for all of us, such health, such plenty. And every year, as art and gardens prosper, we make this rich blue world that much harder to leave. Since we don’t have to. Not even to find our next frontier. Gordian has its own infinity which will not make us brave an airless sea, or weep upon a rock alone. Ever. They bypass grim Poseidon, leave the god who rings the Earth to stand mote-keeper of his black kingdom alone, and chance not to his mercy. Their branch is warm and easy, happy, without aspera, their frontier the Institute’s own motto Profundum et Fundamentum, the boundless deep and foundation: the mind. As progress husbanded by Gordian’s genius makes Earth yet happier...</i></blockquote></spoiler><br/><br/><blockquote><i>Free Speech, that old tool of plutocracy, the intoxicating, rosy blossom under whose petals parasite lies can breed and multiply until they devour all the garden. None of us wants that. I hope none of us wants that, but there are still Free Speech zealots in this day and age, and they’re just the type to have communications tech, to build a radio or study Morse code, and volunteer to join our network as a link and pass on . . . ​death. I’m panicking, I know it. Everyone understands why we need censorship... I do believe it was a pretty thing once, Free Speech, such a lofty notion, but we outgrew it with our communications revolution, as with our machine guns we outgrew pretty chivalry. <br/></i></blockquote> Odium! Also odious:<br/><blockquote><i>our true beliefs are visible in what pokes above the psyche’s surface in those moments when the overflowing heart sings out in gratitude, and then we learn what name it calls: Nature, Humanity, Reason, God, Gaea, Fate, subtle Prometheus, or Providence that takes so much but gives this.</i></blockquote><br/>(every worldview a religion - I spit. Some less so than others!)<br/><br/><blockquote><i>I hope the ideas, the fragile and imperfect Hives of 2454, and the battered but changing-for-the-better Hives of 2456, will help you rise with strength tomorrow morning as you lift your oar, or pack, or first aid kit, whatever task at hand, they’re all the oar so long as you still carry in your breast the ancient spark, contagious, shared from breast to breast, that has died out a thousand times, but never yet in every breast at once.

The chapters are tiny and repetitive and cutesy, no doubt also intended.<br/><br/>The other side of being humanistic is that she draws on theories from the dodgiest sciences: social psychology, pedagogy and a bit of pop neuroscience. But unlike similar books by Baumeister and Dweck, the dubious results are like rhetorical ornament rather than the crux. I give it a pass. Also she's a good teacher, so gets plenty of feedback from students about what actually works. <br/><br/>She accounts for human variance, obviously vital for any good advice:<br/><blockquote><i>Take a step back and look dispassionately at your strengths and weaknesses. If you need more time to learn [a given amount of] math and science, that’s simply the reality. If you’re in high school, try to arrange your schedule to give yourself the time you need to focus on the more difficult materials, and limit these materials to manageable proportions. If you’re in college, try to avoid a full load of heavy courses, especially if you are working on the side. A lighter load of math and science courses can, for many, be the equivalent of a heavy load of other types of courses. Especially in the early stages of college, avoid the temptation to keep up with your peers... learning slowly can mean you learn more deeply than your fast-thinking classmates.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Maybe won't do much for you if you've ever had a good maths teacher.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>Claims</b><br/><br/>- Two disjoint brain modes: focused (""studying"") and diffuse (""shower thoughts"").

It is very hard to think clearly about these things (witness the many inconsistent uses of the term ""bias"" in the field) but O'Neil goes some way toward this. She is more balanced than average, recognising that algorithms can be an improvement over human bias and pettiness (she praises FICO scores as the liberating thing it was, moving money from those bank managers liked to reliable people of any stripe).<br/><br/>The mass, covert automation of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic"">business logic</a> in schools, universities, policing, sentencing, recruitment, health, voting... Much to admire: she is a quant (an expert high-stakes modeller) herself, understands the deep potential of modelling, and prefaces her negative examples with examples of great models, methods of math construction.<br/><br/>She was one of the few technically literate people in Occupy:<br/><blockquote><i>in mid-2011, when Occupy Wall Street sprang to life in Lower Manhattan, I saw that we had work to do among the broader public.

But it isn't the abstract program that does the harm, but being credulous about their predictions. Programs only do harm when they are allowed to make or guide decisions.<br/><br/>She flip-flops between thinking that false positives are the problem, and that any positives based on uncomfortable variables are the problem.<br/><br/><br/>See also ""recommender systems"", ""info filtering systems"", ""decision-making systems"", ""credit scoring"".<br/><br/><blockquote>Predictive models are, increasingly, the tools we will be relying on to run our institutions, deploy our resources, and manage our lives. But as I’ve tried to show throughout this book, these models are constructed not just from data but from the choices we make about which data to pay attention to—and which to leave out. Those choices are not just about logistics, profits, and efficiency. They are fundamentally moral...<br/><br/>Big Data processes codify the past. They do not invent the future. Doing that requires moral imagination, and that’s something only humans can provide. We have to explicitly embed better values into our algorithms, creating models that follow our ethical lead.</blockquote><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>She covers most of the objections I would make to a less subtle author:<br/><blockquote><i>It is true, as data boosters are quick to point out, that the human brain runs internal models of its own, and they’re often tinged with prejudice or self-interest. So its outputs—in this case, teacher evaluations—must also be audited for fairness. And these audits have to be carefully designed and tested by human beings, and afterward automated. In the meantime, mathematicians can get to work on devising models to help teachers measure their own effectiveness and improve.</i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>She does not include inaccuracy as a named criterion for WMDs, but her discussions sometimes require it. This is maybe the core shortcoming of the book: it doesn't wrestle much with the hard tradeoff involved in when modelling unfair situations, e.g. living in a bad neighbourhood which increases your risks and insurance costs through no fault of your own. She comes down straightforwardly on the direct ""make the model pretend it isn't there"" diktat. <br/><br/>But then she notes a case where fairness trumped accuracy and still sucked. ""Value-added modelling"" of teacher quality:<br/><blockquote><i>The teacher scores derived from the tests measured nothing. This may sound like hyperbole. After all, kids took tests, and those scores contributed to Clifford’s. That much is true. But Clifford’s scores, both his humiliating 6 and his chest-thumping 96, were based almost entirely on approximations that were so weak they were essentially random.<br/><br/>The problem was that the administrators lost track of accuracy in their quest to be fair. They understood that it wasn’t right for teachers in rich schools to get too much credit when the sons and daughters of doctors and lawyers marched off toward elite universities. Nor should teachers in poor districts be held to the same standards of achievement. We cannot expect them to perform 1miracles.<br/><br/>So instead of measuring teachers on an absolute scale, they tried to adjust for social inequalities in the model. Instead of comparing Tim Clifford’s students to others in different neighborhoods, they would compare them with forecast models of themselves. The students each had a predicted score. If they surpassed this prediction, the teacher got the credit. If they came up short, the teacher got the blame. If that sounds primitive to you, believe me, it is.</i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>My preferred measure would be to not prevent models from being rational, but instead make transfers to the victims of empirically unfair situation. (This looks pointlessly indirect, but price theory, and the harms of messing with them, is one of the few replicated economic.) My measure has the advantage of not requiring a massive interpretative creep of regulation: you just see what the models do as black boxes and then levy justice taxes after.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>Statistically speaking, in these attempts to free the tests from class and color, the administrators moved from a primary to a secondary model. Instead of basing scores on direct measurement of the students, they based them on the so-called error term — the gap between results and expectations. Mathematically, this is a much sketchier proposition. Since the expectations themselves are derived from statistics, these amount to guesses on top of guesses. The result is a model with loads of random results, what statisticians call “noise.”</i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>* Standardisation - the agreement of units and interfaces that everyone can use - is one of those boring but absolutely vital and inspiring human achievements. WMDs are a dark standardisation.<br/><br/>* In her account, a model doesn't have to be predatory to be a WMD: for instance the recidivism estimator was first formulated by a public-spirited gent.<br/><br/>* She says ""efficiency"" when she often means ""accuracy, and thereby efficiency"". This makes sense rhetorically, because she doesn't want to give the predatory models a halo effect from the less backhanded word ""accurate"". Also lards the texts with ""Big Data""<br/><br/>* The writer Charles Stross, asked recently to write the shortest possible horror story, responded: ""<i>Permanent Transferrable Employee Record</i>"". O'Neil makes us consider that this could be easily augmented with ""including employee medical histories"".<br/><br/>* Surprisingly big evidential gaps: <br/><blockquote><i>By 2009, it was clear that the lessons of the market collapse had brought no new direction to the world of finance and had instilled no new values. The lobbyists succeeded, for the most part, and the game remained the same: to rope in dumb money. Except for a few regulations that added a few hoops to jump through, life went on.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>* The car crash of American higher education is pretty engrossing. She credits the US News ranking with creating the whole mess though, which can't be right. Certainly it had some effect, and could fix some of its harm by including tuition fee size as a negative factor.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>even those who claw their way into a top college lose out. If you think about it, the college admissions game, while lucrative for some, has virtually no educational value. The complex and fraught production simply re-sorts and reranks the very same pool of eighteen-year-old kids in newfangled ways. They don’t master important skills by jumping through many more hoops or writing meticulously targeted college essays under the watchful eye of professional tutors. Others scrounge online for cut-rate versions of those tutors. All of them, from the rich to the working class, are simply being trained to fit into an enormous machine—to satisfy a WMD. And at the end of the ordeal, many of them will be saddled with debt that will take decades to pay off. They’re pawns in an arms race, and it’s a particularly nasty one.</blockquote></i><br/><br/><blockquote><i>Anywhere you find the combination of great need and ignorance, you’ll likely see predatory ads.</i><br/><br/><br/><i>All of these data points were proxies. In his search for financial responsibility, the banker could have dispassionately studied the numbers (as some exemplary bankers no doubt did). But instead he drew correlations to race, religion, and family connections. In doing so, he avoided scrutinizing the borrower as an individual and instead placed him in a group of people — what statisticians today would call a “bucket.” “People like you,” he decided, could or could not be trusted.<br/><br/><br/>Fair and Isaac’s great advance was to ditch the proxies in favor of the relevant financial data, like past behavior with respect to paying bills. They focused their analysis on the individual in question—and not on other people with similar attributes. E-scores, by contrast, march us back in time. They analyze the individual through a veritable blizzard of proxies. In a few milliseconds, they carry out thousands of “people like you” calculations. And if enough of these “similar” people turn out to be deadbeats or, worse, criminals, that individual will be treated accordingly.<br/><br/><br/>From time to time, people ask me how to teach ethics to a class of data scientists. I usually begin with a discussion of how to build an e-score model and ask them whether it makes sense to use “race” as an input in the model. They inevitably respond that such a question would be unfair and probably illegal. The next question is whether to use “zip code.” This seems fair enough, at first. But it doesn’t take long for the students to see that they are codifying past injustices into their model. When they include an attribute such as “zip code,” they are expressing the opinion that the history of human behavior in that patch of real estate should determine, at least in part, what kind of loan a person who lives there should get.<br/><br/><br/>In other words, the modelers for e-scores have to make do with trying to answer the question “How have people like you behaved in the past?” when ideally they would ask, “How have you behaved in the past?” The difference between these two questions is vast. Imagine if a highly motivated and responsible person with modest immigrant beginnings is trying to start a business and needs to rely on such a system for early investment. Who would take a chance on such a person? Probably not a model trained on such demographic and behavioral data.<br/><br/><br/>should note that in the statistical universe proxies inhabit, they often work. More times than not, birds of a feather do fly together. Rich people buy cruises and BMWs. All too often, poor people need a payday loan. And since these statistical models appear to work much of the time, efficiency rises and profits surge. Investors double down on scientific systems that can place thousands of people into what appear to be the correct buckets. It’s the triumph of Big Data.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Microcosm:<br/><blockquote><i>This is not to say that personnel departments across America are intentionally building a poverty trap, much less a racist one. They no doubt believe that credit reports hold relevant facts that help them make important decisions. After all, “The more data, the better” is the guiding principle of the Information Age. Yet in the name of fairness, some of this data should remain uncrunched.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Occasional data-poor hyperbole:<br/><blockquote><i>Insurance is an industry that draws on the majority of the community to respond to the needs of an unfortunate minority. In the villages we lived in centuries ago, families, religious groups, and neighbors helped look after each other when fire, accident, or illness struck. In the market economy, we outsource this care to insurance companies, which keep a portion of the money for themselves and call it profit.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Mistaken in the US: the ""loss ratio"" of US insurance as a whole is greater than 100: loss-making except for financial return on held premiums.<br/><br/><br/><blockquote><i>Workers often don’t have a clue about when they’ll be called to work. They are summoned by an arbitrary program.<br/><br/>Scheduling software also creates a poisonous feedback loop. Consider Jannette Navarro. Her haphazard scheduling made it impossible for her to return to school, which dampened her employment prospects and kept her in the oversupplied pool of low-wage workers. The long and irregular hours also make it hard for workers to organize or to protest for better conditions. Instead, they face heightened anxiety and sleep deprivation, which causes dramatic mood swings and is responsible for an estimated 13 percent of highway deaths. Worse yet, since the software is designed to save companies money, it often limits workers’ hours to fewer than thirty per week, so that they are not eligible for company health insurance. And with their chaotic schedules, most find it impossible to make time for a second job. It’s almost as if the software were designed expressly to punish low-wage workers and to keep them down.<br/><br/><br/>The solution for the statisticians at St. George’s—and for those in other industries—would be to build a digital version of a blind audition eliminating proxies such as geography, gender, race, or name to focus only on data relevant to medical education. The key is to analyze the skills each candidate brings to the school, not to judge him or her by comparison with people who seem similar...<br/><br/>we’ve seen time and again that mathematical models can sift through data to locate people who are likely to face great challenges, whether from crime, poverty, or education. It’s up to society whether to use that intelligence to reject and punish them—or to reach out to them with the resources they need. We can use the scale and efficiency that make WMDs so pernicious in order to help people. It all depends on the objective we choose.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>But how do know we what's relevant to medical education, except by correlation discovery? <br/><br/><br/><blockquote><i>It would also be a cinch to pump up the income numbers for graduates. All colleges would have to do is shrink their liberal arts programs, and get rid of education departments and social work departments while they’re at it, since teachers and social workers make less money than engineers, chemists, and computer scientists. But they’re no less valuable to society.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>This is obvious true on average.

The tragicomedy of human dominion, at this tech level. A couple of the anecdotes pay off:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>The case is detailed in an unusual 1906 book, The Criminal Prosecution and Capital Punishment of Animals.

Slugs given three warnings to stop nettling farmers, under penalty of “smiting”…<br/><br/>We have writs of ejectment issued to rats and thrust into their burrows. From a 1545 complaint brought by vintners against a species of greenish weevil, we have not only the names of the lawyers but early examples of that time-honored legal tactic, the stall. As far as I could tell, the proceedings dragged on eight or nine months—in any case, longer than the life span of a weevil.<br/><br/>… an epidemic of car break-ins at Yosemite campgrounds. Between 2001 and 2007, eleven hundred automobiles were broken into by bears… It turned out that fewer than five bears—sows and their cubs—were behind the break-ins. This is typical. From the start of the year to the September of my visit, bears in Snowmass have broken into houses through unlocked doors or windows sixty times. Wildlife-camera images have implicated just four bears. A bear research scientist with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Dave Garshelis, told me about a call he got from a National Guard camp where bears were raiding pallets of military rations called MREs, which bears apparently enjoy more than soldiers do. He was told that around a hundred bears were raiding the supplies. “The guy said, ‘I’ll bring you to this place where you look across to this ridge that is completely pockmarked with bear dens.’ I was like, ‘This sounds cool.’ ” The “dens” turned out to be natural landscape features, and “a hundred bears” in fact was three.<br/><br/>These elephants were not in the intention to kill,” Officer Raj says. How does he know? Because the bodies were in one piece. “If an elephant is in an angry mode, the body will not be intact. It will get in pieces.” A book by Jayantha Jayewardene includes a list of the nine recorded methods by which an angry or musth-addled elephant has killed a human being. “Placing a fore foot on one limb of the victim and ripping off the other with the trunk” is number 3. (Elephants use a similar anchor-and-pull technique to strip an uprooted shrub of limbs and leaves to eat.) Rulers of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in the 1600s were said to have taken advantage of this natural behavior, training elephants to serve as executioners.<br/><br/>“The past decade has seen a minor epidemic of people plummeting from balconies because of monkeys. I found news accounts of six deaths in the last three years alone. Most famously, there was the 2007 fall of Delhi deputy mayor S. S. Bajwa. While taking the air, Bajwa was startled by a group of macaques set on storming the house to look for food. As he tried to stop them—or get away from them (there were no eyewitnesses)—he lost his footing and hurtled over the railing”<br/><br/>Crow-bombing, in fact, was a government-sponsored conservation effort. Who oversaw the bombing deaths of 250,000 Illinois crows during the winter of 1935? The Illinois conservation commissioner.<br/><br/>Because the birds were many, the cost of ammunition high, and the admiral budget-minded, the initial assault was done without guns. It took place in 1941 and is detailed in a Fish and Wildlife Service Special Scientific Report, under the heading “Large Scale Elimination Experiment.” Two hundred men carrying lengths of pipe or wooden clubs “spent 6 or 7 hours a day” hitting albatrosses on the back of the head. An estimated eighty thousand birds were killed... “The birds,” Hubert wrote in his memoir, “mostly sat quietly in place until clubbed.” Mable’s tapes captured only “the crack of ash on skulls” and, at one point, the distress cry of a young sailor: “I didn’t join the Navy to crush the heads of innocent birds.”<br/><br/>Still, neither Julie nor Sarah would say that gulls, as a species, are dickish.<br/><br/>Shaun makes his living from tourism but is by avocation closer to a naturalist.

Rather than track the sublime nonsense of concrete nature meeting abstract legality, she spends almost all of it hanging with scientists and forest officials, learning some words and spotting some danger. There is little law in it, nor in the topic: instead, ecology and popular opinion determine the creatures’ fate. Here’s the kind of ingenious foolishness I had hoped for a book of, the gerrymandering of morals in the face of an unreformable enemy you don’t have the heart to eradicate:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>India’s top agricultural pests also happen to be sacred animals. Elephants represent the deity Ganesh, and monkeys, Hanuman. The wild boar is an avatar of Vishnu. The nilgai, or blue bull, is actually an antelope, but gai means cow, and cows are sacred. When state officials wanted to begin culling the animal, they first pushed through a name change. Nilgais are now roj, or “forest antelope.”<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Some pretty irresponsible discussion about ricin.<br/><br/>Was surprised when she said she had grandkids; her energetic, relentlessly informal, lulz driven escapades make her sound half her age.<br/><blockquote><i>In a lush tropical environment, a bait has to be extremely tempting† to compete with the natural food sources. Aaron hands me a bottle of Goodnature bait, a chocolatey-coconutty goo that smells, but does not taste, delicious.

That is, anthropology conducted by the opposite side of a total war, for predictive military purposes of the highest consequence. She was of course robbed of the moral superiority of field work by an ocean and a bunch of tanks and whatnot, so this is all based on expat interviews and extremely secondary sources. I'm still struggling to overcome my deep suspicion of cultural anthropology; thus I was actively drawn to Benedict by <a href=""http://apjjf.org/-C.-Douglas-Lummis/2474/article.html"">this hatchet job</a>, by a modern relativist anthropologist. <br/><br/>Sadly the book's only ok, very nicely written but falsely general.

Even so, in the one truly essential passage, Benedict lays out (and later tries to ameliorate) a popular reified caricature of the Japanese: as morbid, conformist, and paradoxical:<br/><blockquote><i>the Japanese have been described in the most fantastic series of ‘...but also's’ ever used for any nation of the world.  When a serious observer is writing about peoples other than the Japanese and says they are unprecedentedly polite, he is not likely to add, ‘But also insolent and overbearing.’ When he says people of some nation are incomparably rigid in their behaviour, he does not add, 'But they also adapt themselves readily to extreme innovations'. When he says a people are submissive, he does not explain too that they are not easily amenable to control from above... When he says they act mostly out of concern for others' opinions, he does not then go on to tell that they have a truly terrifying conscience...<br/><br/>When he writes a book on a nation with a popular cult of aestheticism which gives high honor to actors and to artists and lavishes art upon the cultivation of chrysanthemums, that book does not ordinarily have to be supplemented by another which is devoted to the cult of the sword and the top prestige of the warrior... All these contradictions, however, are the warp and woof of books on Japan.  They are true.  Both the sword and the chrysanthemum are a part of the picture.  The Japanese are to the highest degree, both aggressive and unaggressive, both militaristic and aesthetic, both insolent and polite, rigid and adaptable, submissive and resentful of being pushed around, loyal and treacherous, brave and timid, conservative and hospitable to new ways.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>People say she made this worse, but you can't claim that she didn't know something was up with the Western concepts used. There's an intriguing suggestion that the book is actually a satire (Geertz: ""<i>The Chrysanthemum and the Sword is no more a prettied-up science-without-tears policy tract than [Gulliver's Travels] is a children's book.</i>""). But she actually was attached to military intelligence at the time and actually interviewed Japanese-American internees, and I find I don't much care either way.<br/><br/><br/><i>In one sentence</i>: The above long passage with a question mark on it.",,,1,0

The magic has gone, in two senses. The jokes are flat, the theme repetitive, the jokes repetitive or failed callbacks across the series (nobless obligay). Severe shortage of his inspired similes. The theme is Progress, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenchantment"">Disenchantment</a>, and I have loved Pratchett's human view on it, when it was subtler.<br/><br/>Far too many cameos, in the pure sense of ""hey I member them"". Perhaps self-consciously a final encore. Far too many rushed innovations, filling in British trainspotter culture in a rush.<br/><br/>There's yet another species to emancipate and, harder, to normalise. The goblins are the nerd race, apparently: clever and smelly and hunted for sport.

Terrorism is quite modern. Here we have religious fundamentalists as mere idiots:<br/><blockquote><i>Ardent had followers, stupid followers, and he also had powerful friends. And that was it.

This is consistent with <i>Small Gods / Moving Pictures / Soul Music</i>, where mass belief in an idea gives birth to a quasi-real egregore.<br/><br/>At the same time that the wizards - the singular wielders of absolute power - are being sidelined, Vetinari is shrinking. He is still tyrant here, but his viciousness is pathetic, limited to reflexive sarcasm and insisting on a pet project train line. Actually Pratchett's retaining Vetinari the benevolent despot into the Victorian age of the Disc is quite edgy and rich. Despite his protests, Ankh-Morpork is not London, not New York: it's Singapore, or Kowloon. Human rights without democracy; economic freedom without representation. At the end, the Disc is completely modern - apart from the government! I don't have a good theory of whether this is unrealistic. <br/><br/>The gag is that Vetinari is benevolent while being an assassin and a torturer, a fearsome, malevolent altruist. But he hasn't been conspicuously violent in 10 books and here he's a cipher, a shrugging habitual snarker.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see Pratchett include (in an aside by an extra) the anti-globalisation McWorld viewpoint: progress as destroying something.<br/><blockquote><i>He wasn’t a philosopher and couldn’t even spell the word, but the voice of the goblin officer rang in his head. He thought, what would happen if goblins learned everything about humans and did everything the human way because they thought it was better than the goblin way? How long would it be before they were no longer goblins and left behind everything that was goblin, even their pots? The pots were lovely, he’d bought several for his mum. Goblins took pots seriously now, they sparkled, even at night, but what happens next? Will goblins really stop taking an interest in their pots and will humans learn the serious, valuable and difficult and almost magical skill of pot-making? Or will goblins become, well, just another kind of human? And which would be better?<br/><br/>  And then he thought, maybe a policeman should stop thinking about all this because, after all, there was no crime, nothing was wrong … and yet in a subtle way, there was. Something was being stolen from the world without anybody noticing or caring. <br/></i></blockquote><br/>The solution to this true sighing is to note that cultures are for people, and that if people freely choose to leave a culture behind, up to the last member, then we have gained more than we lost. <br/><br/>Anyway. The Discworld remains the most nourishing and loveable way to show young people the key to human history and to humane ends.",,,1,0

The fact is she and I are now incorporated into this unique subject, the subject of love that views the panorama of the world through the prism of our difference, so this world can be conceived, be born, and not simply represent what fills my own individual gaze.

And all those concerned contained themselves with a decent appearance of that virtue through the clear hours of approach.<br><br/><br/>[on authority]: Inside there were four large chests of silver and a moderate chest of gold: curiously enough they were only closed with a hasp, and on seeing their contents a soldier who had been in the Surprise said they had all risked their lives to gain this wealth and that in his opinion it should be shared out equally at once: now, now, equally and at once.

Yet on the other hand, ours is an eminently respectable society: the Proceedings are known all over the learned world, and the men of the Isaac Newton, however bibulous on occasion, carry recommendations to the government, foreign office and universities of whatever country they visit. I do assure you, Stephen, that our connexion with them, with the Society as a whole in its most sober and learned mood, is a singular advantage to us.'<br/>'My dear, I am entirely in agreement with you, no other Fellow more: yet even so, I could wish they would not laugh; or at the least, if they are truly amused, that they would laugh like men rather than eunuchs’<br/><br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>—<br/><br/>If you haven’t read about the <a href=“ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cochrane,_10th_Earl_of_Dundonald”>real model for Jack</a> you’re in for a treat.<br/><br/>—<br/><br/>The ending is abrupt and glad, like all his endings.

The former three books are largely critical, hacking away at theory-blindness, model error, and the many kinds of people he sees as possessing unearned status (economists, journalists, consultants, business-book writers): this is the upswing, a chaotic attempt to give general positive advice in a world that dooms general positive advice.<br/><br/>Every other page has something worth hearing, for its iconoclasm, or a Latin gobbet, or catty anecdote, if not something globally and evidently true. I think he is right about 30% of the time, which is among the highest credences I have for anyone. I only think I am 35% right, for instance.* But a core point of his system is that his approach should work even given our huge and partially intractable ignorance.<br/><br/>The core point, repeated a hundred times for various domains: <br/><blockquote><br/><i>In real life, many systems deteriorate without an irregular supply of <br/>stressors (non-fatal negative events), and actually benefit from them by constructively overreacting. By robbing such 'antifragile' systems of stressors, modern approaches to managing <br/>them do damage in the guise of helping out.**</i></blockquote><br/>This observation leads to his grand theory of everything: every system is either <i>fragile</i> (damaged by volatility), <i>robust</i> (resistant to damage from volatility), or <i>antifragile</i>. This isn't a trivial distinction, because each has formal properties that allow us to change arrangements to, firstly, prevent explosions, and then to gain from chance volatility. <br/><br/>Biology is definitely one of these antifragile systems***; his case that, absent gross financialisation, the global economy would be one is convincing too; and the idea's at least plausible when applied to the cultivation of virtue or existential strength in a single person. The danger with this - an indissoluble danger because there can be no general strategy to avoid it - is that in welcoming <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress"">constructive stress</a> we'll miss the point at which the welcomed dose turns destructive (where fasting starts to atrophy, where training becomes masochism, where critique becomes pogrom, where sink-or-swim encouragement turns abuse). <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>* This claim is remarkable for both its extreme vagueness and apparent arrogance. Here is a post to handle the former fact. And the latter:<br/><br/>It might strike you as beyond arrogant to assume that you <i>just so happen</i> to be the most reliable inference device in the world, but that doesn't (have to) follow from my claim above, which results from the trivial thought &#8220;I believe my own beliefs most&#8221;, instead.<br/><br/>(Consider the converse: if I came to view anyone as more reliable than me, the rational thing to do would be to incorporate their truer views (and, better, their methods) until I again thought of myself as at least their equal. So, either one believes the superficially arrogant position &#8220;I believe my beliefs most&#8221; &#8211; or else one must believe that one is incapable of adapting enough to superior methods when faced with them, or else one must believe that one cannot know which methods are best. So the above assumption is more about having a high opinion of rational <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/3nn/scientific_selfhelp_the_state_of_our_knowledge/"">adjustment</a> than impossible egotism, I think. <br/><br/>Good news! We can now calibrate ourselves, at least for the most sensational and available predictions using <a href=""http://predictionbook.com/"">this cool thing</a>.^<br/><br/><br/>Finally!: The fully-unpacked, properly defensible assumption might be something more like: &#8220;I am the agent that I know to be most transparently reliable or unreliable; I assume I&#8217;m adjusting properly to better methods; as such I have at least equal confidence in my own belief set, compared to the best known alternative agent's.&#8221;)<br/><br/><blockquote>^ You might wonder if this argument suggests that I should have 100% confidence in my beliefs. No; even if I was the best inferrer, I would suffer uncertainty because of the opacity of my errors: that is, I know I'm often not right but don't know exactly whereabouts I'm not right. Also from the unsystematic internal PredictionBook every non-psychopath has (""<i>wisdom is knowing you'll be an idiot in the future</i>""). And another source of uncertainty is down to the unknowable (like what stocks will crash next week).<br/><br/>I do worry that, whatever my particular self-credence estimate is, the whole approach is subtly wrong somewhere &#8211; since ""40%"" gives the impression that I think of myself as a worse guide to the world than dumb chance^^ &#8211; but I think it works. Particularly if much of the missing 60% is made of safe scepticism rather than errors.<br/><br/>^^ For binary event spaces &#8211; but, really, how many of those are there in real life?<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>** He credits the formal basis of all this to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality"">Jensen's inequality</a>, in a chapter which might be the clearest expression of the idea there is.<br/><br/>*** (In particular species-level evolution, but also organism-level health.) <br/><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><div style=""text-align: center;""><br/>*************************************************************&nbsp;</div><br/><br/>Some pigeonholes you might think to put all this in:<br/><br/><ul>* <li><i>Conservative?</i> Yes; but a good-hearted Burkean (<i>&#8220;Antifragility implies that the old is superior to the new&#8230; What survives must be good at serving some purpose that time can see but our eyes and logical faculties can&#8217;t capture&#8230;&#8221;</i>). Most people are conservative over <i>some</i> things (e.g. the natural world; we just happen to call that conservationism instead). Also approves of any high technology that removes anything he views as a disease of civilisation, like <a href=""http://regressing.deadspin.com/the-scientific-case-against-vibrams-fivefinger-running-1575132888"">these things</a> were supposed to be. So, in general, conservative only in the sense that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk"">existential risk</a> people are.*</li><br/><br/>* <li><i>Economic conservatism</i>. Only sort of; he's a trader, and would have speculation free to flow <i>provided that deposit banks were nationalised first</i>, and prioritises deficit reduction in a way we associate with conservatives but which e.g. <a href=""http://www.voxeu.org/article/fiscal-consolidation-sweden-role-model"">Sweden pulled off</a> without any lasting social justice sting. More formally he is against centralisation on both moral and technical grounds; that is <i>likely</i> a principle with some conservative effects, justified, in theory, by its keeping us alive. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-critical_system"">Life-critical</a> politics.)</li><br/><li><i>Laissez faire?</i> No: he recommends radical change to e.g. science funding, but no decrease. Big fan of Switzerland&#8217;s government, read into that what you will. He sees &#8220;optionality&#8221;, an originally financial concept, as the solution to fragility risks and the key to success in every domain there is. This isn&#8217;t at all as economistic as it sounds; the sacred and the humane somehow fit perfectly into his core rationalist agenda, persistence through change.</li><br/><br/>* <li><i>Social conservatism?</i> No sign; no discussion of discrimination. Some people think such abstention is oppressive, but they are probably wrong.</li><br/>* <li><i>Social Darwinist?</i> Nah.</li><br/>* <li><i>Bioconservative?</i> Absolutely; he describes himself as the &#8216;diametric&#8217; opposite of <a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/1000017/google-exec-ray-kurzweil-takes-150-vitamin-supplements-every-day/"">Ray Kurzweil</a>, and he&#8217;s in full uproar over the global risk posed by synthetic biology (and recently fleshed out this horror <a href=""https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8nhAlfIk3QIbGFzOXF5UUN3N2c/edit?pli=1"">in highly rigorous terms</a>).</li><br/>* <li><i>Anti-intellectual?</i> Not at all! Only anti-academia, and they still do not represent the whole of quality intellectual life. Hates irresponsible &#8216;canned methods of inference&#8217; too (statistical significance, etc).</li><br/>* <li><i>Lacrimist?</i> (That is, does he glorify suffering?) Not quite. He certainly views comfort as vitiating. His opposition to transhumanism is too quick and doesn't take the moral challenge of a world of pained beings seriously enough, for me.</li><br/>* <li><i>Macho?</i> Hm. Well, nature <i>has</i> made certain challenging actions optimal. Amusing proto-paleo attitude, too: <br/>* <blockquote><i>I, for my part, resist eating fruits not found in the ancient Eastern Mediterranean (I use &#8220;I&#8221; here in order to show that I am not narrowly generalizing to the rest of humanity). I avoid any fruit that does not have an ancient Greek or Hebrew name, such as mangoes, papayas, even oranges. Oranges seem to be the postmedieval equivalent of candy; they did not exist in the ancient Mediterranean.</i></blockquote></li><br/></ul><br/><br/><br/>* His work fits the x-risk paradigm very well, but he developed his edifice in complete isolation from them, and has an uncompromising scepticism about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"">expected value</a> that might not make cross-overs all that fruitful.<br/><div style=""text-align: center;""><br/>*************************************************************&nbsp;</div><br/><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/02/antifragile-nassim-nicholas-taleb-review"">How original is the core point, really</a>?<br/><br/>Well, who cares? His claim is that he had to invent the word 'antifragile', not the idea. He says, idiosyncratically, that Seneca and Nietzsche had the nub of the idea, and Jensen the formal essence; Darwin certainly did too. ""<a href=""http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754646419"">Resilience engineering</a>"" and in computing, '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming"">defensive programming</a>' (b. 1998) and '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_computing"">self-healing systems</a>' (b. 2001) are at least on the same track, though not getting beyond a lively sort of robustness. But I doubt that most systems can become antifragile - e.g. it's hard to imagine an antifragile jet engine (one that harvests <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_strike"">bird strikes</a> for fuel, or soot cleaning)? So maybe it's only the grand generalisation to all design that's new.<br/><br/><div style=""text-align: center;""><br/>*************************************************************&nbsp;</div><br/><br/>Gripes: His footnotes are collected by theme rather than linked to his claims directly, which makes it so difficult to follow up his sources that his credibility suffers. He namedrops, which is not the same as showing his working. I would really like to see his backing for his cool claims (about e.g. an irregular sleep pattern as a good thing, or things like &#8216;I suspect that thermal comfort ages people&#8217;), but it&#8217;s hidden away and <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/"">often one-study</a>. (Again: <i>apparently</i> one-study, since his working is not easily on show.)<br/><br/>He has a surprisingly high opinion of Steve Jobs &#8211; who I view as a grand example of an <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/empty-suit.asp"">empty suit</a>: there are 9 references to Jobs&#8217; hokey shark-wisdom, (where Gigerenzer and Mandelbrot get 8, Jensen gets 7, Marx 7). Does Jobs really count as a &#8216;practitioner&#8217; with &#8216;skin in the game&#8217;? Eh.<br/><br/>His homebrew jargon starts to drag &#8211; some sentences are wholly composed of <a href=""http://xkcd.com/483/"">his neologisms</a> plus a barrel of articles and prepositions. (I used the glossary early and often.) Repetitive: tells what he&#8217;ll tell you, tells you he&#8217;s told you. Some passages really suffer from his wholesale hostility to copy-editing; there are some flatly bad sentences here. And he namedrops a lot, more than fair attribution of ideas &#8211; there are several passages that are just lists of people he likes (e.g. p.257-8). <br/><br/>I don't see that it's worthwhile to criticise his arrogant style; it's what animates his points, and he never uses it on weak targets.<br/><br/>Lastly, he sometimes makes of a system&#8217;s persistence the highest good. (Where its persistence is to be contrasted with mere stability.) This is in tension with his wonderful emphasis on artistic and quasi-sacred values elsewhere in the book.<br/><br/>But it talks about everything, is historically wide-eyed, relentlessly rational, and often funny.

Not much plot either, just an image stream: one long chase sequence. These are heavy constraints to work within, harder than say free verse (which gets to silently import nearly all of the sense from whatever language it chooses to wear), and it is amazing how much meaning he manages to convey. Still less than you probably need.<br/><br/>We cross an invisible boundary twice. We move from a Kowloon recursive shanty, chased by cops, to an eldritch snuff brothel, chased by monsters, with hallucinogens along the way muzzing reality. Horrible creatures seem to do terrible things to children, women, a scuba diver, in beautiful surroundings. The orchestrator of the monsters is beaten to death, and rises in death to violate his killer. The box man watches in horror, but can’t stop to help, has to keep moving. Then we're back in the shanty, pursued by monsters and cops and then just cops. Somehow this doesn’t feel cheap like say Maruo or most <i>guro</i> stylists. The Asia Extreme pervertedness is not the point here, and most of the surreal touches are not sexed or violent (florist with a perch-fish face, frog playing the koto), and we run past them to the sea. <br/><br/><i>Why</i> be grotesque? And why am I asking that instead of “why be beautiful?” Maybe: Creating beauty is its own justification; making something ugly means you need to compensate us, either in virtuosity (Nabokov’s prose, or Penderecki’s harmonics, or Ito’s linework) or in access to otherwise inaccessible thoughts or feelings. (Novelty is a common justification but I don't think it works alone.) Sakabashira pays both taxes, just about. About a third of the book is impressive double-page single panels, and the visual perspective of these big detailed places is one of the few continuities among the obscure fantasy squibs.<br/><br/><spoiler>The book has a clear and good allegorical reading: the box man is ferrying his senile dad to an old folk’s home / a hospice. The monsters are the ill-health, dependency, and misanthropy of decay - the chief of the monsters, dementia, devours brains. I dunno what the cheery kappa is, maybe a nurse, or the father’s old self, true self - kappas also need to return to the sea. Why cops? I take both cops and demons to be the other burdens of the son’s life, taxes and death. Compassionate leave doesn’t last long, if you get any. I don’t know why the old folk’s home is depicted as a crazy party - maybe merely not having to work anymore is ecstatic. Or what it means for cops (society, work, obligations) to kill your monsters (negativity, malice, trauma).

It’s probably pretty hard for people outside the UK to understand Jack’s sentimental uneconomical Conservatism - or, since the One Nation Tories are dead and buried, even if you’re in the UK.<br/><blockquote><i>'Jack,' said Stephen, 'I have been contemplating on your words about the nature of the majority, your strangely violent, radical, and even - forgive me - democratic words, which, with their treasonable implication of ""one man, one vote"", might be interpreted as an attack on the sacred rights of property; and I should like to know how you reconcile them with your support of a Tory ministry in the House.'<br/><br/>'Oh, as for that,' said Jack, 'I have no difficulty at all. It is entirely a matter of scale and circumstance. Everyone knows that on a large scale democracy is pernicious nonsense - a country or even a county cannot be run by a self-seeking parcel of tub-thumping politicians working on popular emotion, rousing the mob. Even at Brooks's, which is a hotbed of democracy, the place is in fact run by the managers and those that don't like it may either do the other thing or join Boodle's; while as for a man-of-war, it is either an autocracy or it is nothing, nothing at all - mere nonsense. You saw what happened to the poor French navy at the beginning of the Revolutionary War...'<br/><br/>'...while at the other end of the scale, although ""one man, one vote"" certainly smells of brimstone and the gallows, everyone has always accepted it in a jury trying a man for his life. An inclosure belongs to this scale: it too decides men's lives. I had not realized how thoroughly it does so until I came back from sea and found that Griffiths and some of his friends had persuaded my father to join with them in inclosing Woolcombe Common: he was desperate for money at the time. Woolcombe was never so glorious a place as Simmon's Lea, but I like it very well - surprising numbers of partridge and woodcock in the season - and when I saw it all cleared, flattened, drained, fenced and exploited to the last half-bushel of wheat, with many of the small encroachments ploughed up and the cottages destroyed, and the remaining commoners, with half of their living and all their joy quite gone, reduced to anxious cap-inhand casual labourers, it hurt my heart...’<br/><br/>‘...what they and the bigger farmers hate is the possibility of the labourers growing saucy, as they call it, asking for higher wages - for a wage that keeps up with the price of corn - refusing to work if they do not get it, and falling back on what they can wring from the common. No common, no sauciness'</i></blockquote><br/><br/>i.e. Class war, but with peasants and aristos against the bourgeoisie.

'But,' said Harding, 'it is what we are used to; and with all its plagues it is better than being on the parish or having to go round to the farmer's back door begging for a day's work and being turned away. No, it ain't all beer and skittles but with the common a man is at least half his own man. And without the common he's the farmer's dog. That's why we are so main fond of Captain Jack.'</i></blockquote><br/><br/>—<br/><br/><blockquote><i>Stephen took his disappointment philosophically. After all, he had himself reached nearly seven years of age before he paid really serious attention to voles.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>—<br/><br/><blockquote><i>He felt no particular guilt [for cheating on his wife] except for this foolishness [in leaving evidence]: by his code a man who was directly challenged [seduced] must in honesty engage -anything else would be intolerably insulting. Yet had he known of this miserable old woman's prying and her malice he would certainly have played the scrub in Canada.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>—<br/><br/><blockquote><i>He revered the sound if not the full implication of the Book of Common Prayer, the Lessons and the usual psalms and readings: the other rituals such as the inspection of the entire ship and every soul aboard her, clean, shaved, sober and toeing a given line or rather seam, soothed his mind; and although today he did not feel up to reading a sermon he and all his people were pei~ectly satisfied with the even more usual Articles of War, which, through immemorial use, had acquired ecclesiastical qualities of their own.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>—<br/><br/>Diana: <br/><blockquote><i>‘I have it on the best authority [her own] that Jack is no artist in these matters [sex]. He can board and carry an enemy frigate with guns roaring and drums beating in a couple of minutes; but that is no way to give a girl much pleasure. In better hands she would, I am sure, have been a very likely young woman; and oh so much happier.'<br/>'Clearly, you know more about these things than I.’</i></blockquote><br/><br/>—<br/><br/>The military-military complex:<br/><blockquote><i>'War of course is a bad thing,' he went on. 'But it is our way of life - has been these twenty years and more - and for most of us it is our only hope of a ship, let alone of promotion: and I well remember how my heart sank in the year two, the year of the peace of Amiens. But let me offer this reflection by way of comfort: in the year two my spirits were so low that if I could have afforded a piece of rope I should have hanged myself. Well, as everyone knows that peace did not last, and in the year four I was made post, jobbing captain of Lively, and a lively time we had of it too. I throw this out, because if one peace with an untrustworthy enemy can be broke, another peace with the same fellow can be broke too; and our country will certainly need defending, above all by sea.

It was an emotion he had apparently never known, at least not in its present consuming state, and it was one whose nature and development he scarcely seemed to recognize at all, so that he was unable to call upon intelligence for what help it can bring in these cases.<br/><br/>Stephen was well acquainted with this blindness where health was concerned - 'It is only a lump: it will soon go away' - and affections - 'She has certainly not received my letter. The posts are so slow these days, and very far from sure' - yet even so it surprised him in Jack Aubrey, a much more intelligent man than he seemed to those who did not know him well. With great concern he had watched the progress of the disease, the changes in the atmosphere at Ashgrove Cottage, where Mr Hinksey continued to call with the most unlucky regularity, often appearing a few moments before Jack left, and the beginning of a change in the Bellona. Jack was still very kind to him...<br/><br/>'I had been on the point of unbosoming myself... foolish, discreditable thoughts.'<br/><br/>'I rejoice you did not, brother. The closest friendship cannot stand such a strain: the results are invariably disastrous.'</i></blockquote><br/><br/>—<br/><br/>Conversely, Stephen’s wisdom and serenity lessens. The two men are roughly equal stature in their middle years, where in youth Jack was foolish, cockbrained, naive.<br/><blockquote><i>[Stephen] had some faults, and one was a habit of dosing himself, generally from a spirit of inquiry, as in his period of inhaling large quantities of the nitrous oxide and of the vapour of hemp, to say nothing of tobacco, bhang in all its charming varieties in India, betel in Java and the neighbouring islands, qat in the Red Sea, and hallucinating cacti in South America, but sometimes for relief from distress, as when he became addicted to opium in one form or another; and now he was busily poisoning himself with coca-leaves, whose virtue he had learnt in Peru.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>Stephen's dislike for killing his fellow-men often embarrassed Jack, whose profession it was, and he quickly added 'Of course, that is only the ideal course of events.

Some of them, indeed, can scarcely claim so high a rank.’<br/><br/>“Stephen stood up to peer out of the window at the evening sky, and now, looking back into the room, he saw Jack in the full north light, sitting as though for his portrait. He seemed broader than before, heavier, profoundly grave of course, and somewhat leonine; but beneath the unmoved gravity Stephen perceived a wound that was hardly affected by the news of the Surprise; and in the hope of easing it to some degree he added, ‘And in the strictest confidence, my dear, I may tell you that our war will not be entirely private either. You know something of my activities; and at intervals of harrying the enemy’s commerce I may have errands of that kind to run.’ Jack took the point; he expressed his pleasure with a polite inclination of his head and the appearance of a smile; and the pain remained unaffected. Stephen continued, ‘This damned spiteful pillory, brother. It is of no essential importance to an innocent man, but it is bound to be unpleasant, like a toothache: I have given you many a draught for the toothache, so I have, and here is one’ – taking a small bottle from his pocket – ‘that will make the pillory pass like little more than a dream: disagreeable, but only faintly disagreeable, and at a distance. I have often used it myself, with great effect.’<br/><br/>‘Thankee, Stephen,’ said Jack, setting the bottle on the mantelshelf. Stephen saw that he had no intention of taking it, and that the underlying pain was quite untouched. For to Jack Aubrey the fact of no longer belonging to the Navy counted more than a thousand pillories, the loss of fortune, loss of rank, and loss of future. It was in a way a loss of being, and to those who knew him well it gave his eyes, his whole face, the strangest look.<br/><br/><br/></blockquote>",,,1,0

His argument was this: the arts alone distinguish men from the brutes and make life almost bearable - the arts flourish only in time of peace - universal rule is a prerequisite for universal peace; and here as I recall he quoted Gibbon on the happiness of living in the age of the Antonines, concluding that in effect the absolute Roman emperor, even Marcus Aurelius, was a tyrant, if only in posse, but that the pax romana was worth the potential exercise of this tyranny. As my Frenchman saw it, Napoleon was the only man or rather demi-god capable of imposing a universal empire, so on humanitarian and artistic grounds he fought in the Garde imperiale.'<br/></i></blockquote><br/>But then he spends the rest of the book demonstrating his total corruption and lack of principle, leading to the most iniquitous moment of the series:<br/><blockquote><i>[French handler:] 'As for Maturin, I do have a certain indirect hold for the time being, but J am afraid it cannot last, and the moment it is gone he must be eliminated.

Nor is that to the point: the person, unless he be extraordinarily good or extraordinarily bad, is of no importance. It is the living, moving, procreating, sometimes speaking symbol that counts.’<br/>‘But surely mere birth without any necessary merit is illogical?’<br/>‘Certainly, and that is its great merit. Man is a deeply illogical being, and must be ruled illogically. Whatever that frigid prig Bentham may say, there are innumerable motives that have nothing to do with utility. In good utilitarian logic a man does not sell all his goods to go crusading, nor does he build cathedrals; still less does he write verse. There are countless pieties without a name that find their focus in a crown. It is as well, I grant you, that the family should have worn it beyond the memory of man; for your recent creations do not answer – they are nothing in comparison of your priest-king, whose merit is irrelevant, whose place cannot be disputed, nor made the subject of a recurring vote.”</i></blockquote><br/>Poetry, being quicker than novels and requiring zero capital, comes out pretty well on a real utilitarian view. Cathedrals are good, it's just that they have to wait, after the homeless shelters. And never mind that he justifies illogical monarchy, illogical governance with a <i>logical</i> argument (tacitly anyway - it is Hobbes’ plea for stability, any stability, or maybe an appeal to the great deadweight of political manoeuvring).

The fact that the dodo has a keel to her breastbone whereas the ostrich and her kind have none presents no moral issue; nor does the dissolution of gold by aqua regia. We erect hypotheses, to be sure, some of us to a most stupendous height, but we always hope to sustain them by demonstrable facts in time: these are not the province of the moralist. Perhaps it might be said that your moral philosopher is in pursuit of wisdom rather than of knowledge; and indeed what he is concerned with is not so much the object of knowledge as of intuitive perception – is scarcely susceptible of being known. Yet whether wisdom can be any more profitably pursued than happiness is a question. Certainly the few moral philosophers I have known do not seem to have been outstandingly successful in either, whereas some natural philosophers, such as Sir Humphrey Davy…’ Stephen carried on to the end of his long, his very long sentence...<br/><br/>“teaching young gentlemen has a dismal effect upon the soul. It exemplifies the badness of established, artificial authority. The pedagogue has almost absolute authority over his pupils: he often beats them and insensibly he loses the sense of respect due to them as fellow human beings. He does them harm, but the harm they do him is far greater. He may easily become the all-knowing tyrant, always right, always virtuous; in any event he perpetually associates with his inferiors, the king of his company... Have you ever known a schoolmaster fit to associate with grown men? The Dear knows I never have. They are most horribly warped indeed”<br/><br/>“The crackle and yield of this little paper cylinder,’ he said, holding it up, ‘gives me a sensual pleasure whose deeper origins I blush to contemplate, while the slow combustion of the whole yields a gratification that I should not readily abandon even if it did me harm, which it does not. Far from it. On the contrary, tobacco purges the mind of its gross humours, sharpens the wits, renders the judicious smoker sprightly and vivacious. And soon I shall need all my sprightliness and vivacity.”<br/><br/>“All those officers who were not on duty went back to their game of shove-groat in the gunroom: a great competition had been going on since Malta, and although the prize of twelve and sixpence seemed trifling since the capture of the Bonhomme Richard, they still played with the greatest eagerness, as careless of the glorious sky, the perfect sea, the spectacular Ionian shore, and even of Pyrrhus and the Dalmatian pelicans as they had been in some sunless convoy, far out in the drizzling German Ocean”<br/><br/>“in war there is neither Turk nor Christian nor moral consideration.’<br/>‘A war like that would not be worth fighting,’ said Jack.<br/>‘And yet the Dear knows war is not a game,’ said Stephen.<br/>‘No,’ said Jack. ‘Perhaps I should have said not worth winning”<br/><br/></blockquote>",,,1,0

This is true whether we want it to be or not... Whereas previously our physical strength determined how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed, it now merely determines how well we function in these new surroundings we have crafted for ourselves as our culture has accumulated. But we are still animals – our physical existence is, in the final analysis, the only one that actually matters. A weak man is not as happy as that same man would be if he were strong. This reality is offensive to some people who would like the intellectual or spiritual to take precedence. It is instructive to see what happens to these very people as their squat strength goes up.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>A salvo(!) This message is repulsive, unjust, and almost exactly fits my experience. (Though he is being imprecise: better to say ""the most important foundation"", a key instrument rather than the highest terminus. Though even then it's not ""most important"", since it neglects an even larger nonintellectual effect on my philosophy of life, love.)  I was once a very unhappy young man with a tragicomic existential view - and so many fixable, concrete, absurdly powerful options, <i>absurdly unknown to me</i>. The lifter is Sisyphus, happy. Weights are a strong psychological intervention, perhaps the third-strongest for me.<br/><br/>Lots of reasoning from first principles, which is satisfying and gives it an Athenian air, but which I can just barely evaluate. Luckily it is just so easy to check if he's right (for your case).<br/><br/><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fzQ33Gvz9-9jX5uv6XDiBjpDsjX9bmxfihqe_7Bo2inj0q2V7Kr-DVWDEURCwCY50HSXmD2HeHl5CHUfhl2ALf2pxW0eX8bwXnL4VhYwEK3SodbAXrnZjKzm5Ba0uli-5k9GctY4uyWg6JKb2B8Ver8iMkUiZeeVStWfD7tUl1pIj6i8z2x8wPX4A8Z6tc4YblSj3r53fFNkcCUyZn5xYiIqY5Wka1JMxAO7_tuuxt1nZWSn8luFkgKlsmW5Fqsud3qg2yS_06KAOuNuSChyFwbG9gAFGyyNZvX9lsvGagnhS-e3zx-7MsoKrNJFsL83PHS_8vJcG-HiAOiuYMihLY3x_JkrljGXpLEC5I-k8xGhF4zydg55ohnQvWG6r9rTmSac3pj8lHAff5ezNS2eozHx0HzR9kjPcBznih6DEkQV6W7xZkKffiadL6t7Qe4Hj13XXjKpqezG5FNMKHokfG2DlzaPiL4EGeN1tQXlVofFPV_RbNOe5W96nh9iV0YnDPjvUBVYwfQhT3-xMt050a-QDXQCVq7oR3EAkWIT-KB3F3ZG32Hj3NNIb0usDPMISKMewuAg_56DhSqo4-mqd2kFEYD7w752PK2HMMcDZRbduyGW7P3BBHOX-TJ3PpKyAxhBLzBmMNdZq5QoVII1qd6WQhRGVu9YXfl9JkueFZ5FCj9QEzBNytYe6w--a968CeM2LP7WDuUeLJdWqtU0Bk8j6xOE5ltT-yBSMZaARyw8vUA"" /><br/><blockquote><i>The force of gravity acting on the bar is always acting straight down in a vertical line. Therefore, the most efficient way to oppose this force is by acting on it vertically as well. So not only is a straight line the shortest distance between two points, but a straight vertical line is also the most efficient bar path for a barbell moving through space in a gravitational framework.</blockquote></i><br/><br/><blockquote><i>Your bench press strength doesn’t adapt to the total number of times you’ve been to the gym to bench or to your sincerest hope that it will get stronger. It adapts to the stress imposed on it by the work done with the barbell. Furthermore, it adapts to exactly the kind of stress imposed on it. If you do sets of 20, you get good at doing 20s. If you do heavy singles, you get better at doing those.</blockquote></i><br/><br/><blockquote><i>“good technique” in barbell training is easily and understandably defined as the ability of the lifter to keep the bar vertically aligned with the balance point.</blockquote></i><br/><br/><br/>Rippetoe is the source of the recent renaissance in cheap simple barbells (dozens of muscles recruited at once) over circuits of giant single-muscle machines. He tells a plausibly mean story about the economic perverse incentives that led to the latter, 1980-2010.<br/><br/>There is too much detail here - he discusses variants of the movements and the debate over them. But what a trivial criticism that is! I think most people could skip two-thirds of the book, since there's detailed kinematics for each move, instructor tips and gym-building tips, but it's interesting throughout. You could get the key parts from the final Programme section, then the ""what not to do"" chapter closing sheets. Warm-up sets chapter was very useful.<br/><blockquote><i>if your schedule does not allow time for proper warm-up, it does not allow time for training at all... [The squat] should be carefully and thoroughly prepared with a couple of empty-bar sets, and then as many as five sets between those and the work sets.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>There's an abrupt shift in tone, in the chapter on lifting for kids: he starts citing University press books and listing comparative numbers for his claims. So this is a crusade for him.<br/><br/>It is unlikely that you'd learn form from this alone, even like reading it and applying it live with a mirror. It is unlikely that you could find a PT with this much physical knowledge or clarity.<br/><br/>He's quite bitchy, which I like but you might not:<br/><blockquote><i>if you continually miss workouts, you are not actually training, and your obviously valuable time should be spent more productively elsewhere.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>If you're not increasing your weight, you're not training, and so not following his programme. The obsession with increase is still not mine. Strength, yes, exertion yes, but constant expansion? I aim for 100kg squat, and expect to attain it this year. <i>Not</i> herniating weight, not kneecapping weight, not sclerotic weight: nice big weight. Maybe once I get there I will grow bored, will again be confounded by the power of concrete body on worldview, and have to start climbing again. He thinks everyone gets injured eventually. But is this under the permanent revolution programme?<br/><blockquote><i>Ambition is useful, greed is not. Most of human history and the science of economics demonstrate that the desire for more than is currently possessed drives improvement, both personally and for societies. But greed is an ugly thing when uncontrolled and untempered with wisdom, and it will result in your program’s progress coming to an ass-grinding halt.</blockquote></i><br/><br/><blockquote><i>you’re a little fluffy around the belly, you have obviously already created the conditions necessary for growth. You’ll usually start out stronger than the skinny guy, and because your body hasn’t got the problems with growing that skinny guys do, strength gains can come more easily for you if you eat correctly.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>I've been doing a derivative of this program since October, no trainer, lots of missed sessions, just the primary exercises, 1 hour and out, a scaled-up ordinary diet, and saw decent gains, +50kg onto my initial squat. Rippetoe claims that this could be achieved in half the time with many gallons of milk and much more aggro, and I see no reason to doubt this.<br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/><br><br/><br/><b>Philosophical aspects of lifting</b>:<br/><br/>* As above: The body helps determine the mind. You should be wary of your own philosophy, not just because of your local social conditioning, but also because of your diet, your habits, your daily kindness, and your bench. The lifter is Sisyphus, happy.<br/><br/>* No excuses, no wiggle room, no ambiguity: lifting a lot without injuring yourself is a brute fact, unbiased. Rippetoe: ""<i>cause and effect cannot be argued with or circumvented by your wishes and desires.</i>""<br/><br/>* 'He's a growing <a href=""https://dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/loun"">loon</a>!' my granny would say, justifying my early gluttony. Well, twenty years later here I am again, a growing boy. Artificial growth, body neoteny. What does a sense of increase, of coming potential, do to you?<br/><br/>* <blockquote><i>""Waiting until soreness subsides before doing the next workout is a good way to guarantee that soreness will be produced every time, since you’ll never get adapted to sufficient workload frequency to stop getting sore.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>* There are so many ways to do it wrong. (Only some of those wrong ways break you - the others just slow you down or confuse your body.) Rippetoe focusses on five movements, out of however many thousand physiologically possible ones. These are picked for excellent reasons, tested over decades.<br/><br/>* <blockquote><i>Exercise is the thing we must do to replicate the conditions under which our physiology was – and still is – adapted, the conditions under which we are physically normal. In other words, exercise is substitute caveman activity, the thing we need to make our bodies, and in fact our minds, normal in the 21st century.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>* <blockquote><i>Psychologically, 20 [rep max] work is very hard, due to the pain, and lifters who are good at it develop the ability to displace themselves from the situation during the set. Or they just get very tough.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>* I live in my head. But the hip drive out of a deep squat is such a strong strange confluence of forces, vaguely under my control but more accurately an explosion I light the fuse on, that I am driven to notice and appreciate neuromuscular marvels.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><i>Book epistemic status</i>: Decades of personal experience plus strong amateur theory plus distilled folk wisdom, in a domain with rapid and unambiguous feedback. He's quite open about unknown things, e.g. the molecular nature of soreness. Sometimes a little defensive, against experts less near to the metal. Sample:<br/><blockquote><i>Most sources within the heavy-training community agree that a good starting place is one gram of protein per pound of bodyweight per day, with the rest of the diet making up 3500–6000 calories, depending on training requirements and body composition. Although these numbers produce much eyebrow-raising and cautionary statement-issuing from the registered-dietetics people, it is a fact that these numbers work well for the vast majority of people who lift weights, and these numbers have worked well for decades.</blockquote></i><br/><br/><i>Why trust my opinion at all?</i> I've followed <a href=""https://stronglifts.com/"">Rippetoe's programme</a> inconsistently for 4 months and still got good returns - worth it for mental health alone. I know sophomore biology and physics, and nothing he says here contradicts any of it.",,,1,0

Jack had known Killick ever since his first command, and as he had risen in rank so Killick's sullen independence had increased; he was angrier than usual now because Jack had wrecked his number three uniform and lost one of his gloves: 'Coat torn in five places—cutlass slash in the forearm which how can I ever darn that? Bullet 'ole all singed, never get the powder-marks out. Breeches all a-hoo, and all this nasty blood everywhere, like you'd been a-wallowing in a lay-stall, sir.

He was ceremonious, naturally kind, and he had a great and oppressive sense of duty. </i></blockquote><br/>On the vulgarity of true aristos:<br/><blockquote><i>General Aubrey belonged to another civilisation, a civilisation untouched by the age of enlightenment or the spread of the bourgeoisie, one that had passed away in the counties nearer London long before Sophie was born and one to which her essentially urban, respectable, middle-class family had never belonged at any time. She had been brought up in a quiet, staid, manless house and she did not know what to make of his gallantries, his praise of Jack's taste (Cecilia would have been more at home with him); nor of his observation that Jack was a sad dog—always had been—but she was not to mind it—Jack's mother never had. Sophia would not mind half a dozen love-children, he was sure. </i></blockquote><br/>On innovation:<br/><blockquote><i>“But any gait, all of 'em you see in this weather line, is what we call twelve-hundred-tonners; though to be sure some gauges thirteen and even fifteen hundred ton, Thames measurement. Wexford, there, with her brass fo'c'sle eight-pounder winking in the sun, she does: but we call her a twelve hundred ton ship.'<br/>   'Sir, might it not be simpler to call her a fifteen hundred ton ship?'<br/>   'Simpler, maybe: but it would never do. You don't want to be upsetting the old ways. Oh dear me, no. God's my life, if the Captain was to hear you “carrying on in that reckless Jacobin, democratical line, why, I dare say he would turn you adrift on a three-inch plank, with both your ears nailed down to it, to learn you bashfulness, the way he served three young gentlemen in the Med. No, no: you don't want to go arsing around with the old ways: the French did so, and look at the scrape it has gotten them into” </i></blockquote><br/>One jarring bit: Stephen the caring pacifist is extremely quick to fight lethal duels over minor points of honour. This is partly down to his aiming to be nonlethal, but come on.<br/><blockquote><i>‘He was blaming his particular friend for romantic notions the other day—the friend who is to marry the daughter of that woman we saw just now—and if I had not been so shocked by his condition, I should have been tempted to laugh.

(People say this is the worst one but it is still better than most novels.) There are 30 notable moments (sailors as manservants, Mrs Williams’ idiot machiavellianism, Scrivens’ poster, the Canning offer, the experimental weapon, press-ganging the debt-bailiffs, dressing Jack as a bear, the undischarged duel, Jack’s powerful fear of bees) and 5 or so bravura passages<br/><blockquote><i>Tides, tides, the Cove of Cork, the embarkation waiting on the moon, a tall swift-pacing mule in the bare torrid mountains quivering in the sun, palmetto-scrub, Señor don Esteban Maturin y Domanova kisses the feet of the very reverend Lord Abbot of Montserrat and begs the honour of an audience. The endless white road winding, the inhuman landscape of Aragon, cruel sun and weariness, dust, weariness to the heart, and doubt. What was independence but a word? What did any form of government matter? Freedom: to do what? Disgust, so strong that he leant against the saddle, hardly able to bring himself to mount. A shower on the Maladetta, and everywhere the scent of thyme: eagles wheeling under thunder-clouds, rising, rising. 'My mind is too confused for anything but direct action,' he said. 'The flight disguised as an advance.”<br/><br/>“The lonely beach, lanterns flashing from the offing, an infinity of sea. Ireland again, with such memories at every turn. 'If I could throw off some of this burden of memory,' said Stephen to his second glass of laudanum, 'I should be more nearly sane. Here's to you, Villiers, my dear.' The Holyhead mail and two hundred and seventy miles of rattling jerking, falling asleep, waking in another country: rain, rain, rain: Welsh voices in the night. London, and his report, trying to disentangle the strands of altruism, silliness, mere enthusiasm, self-seeking, love of violence, personal resentment; trying too to give the impossible plain answer to the question 'Is Spain going to join France against us, and if so, when?' And there he was in Deal once more, sitting alone in the snug of the Rose and Crown, watching the shipping in the Downs and drinking a pot of tea: he had an odd detachment from all this familiar scene - the uniforms that passed outside his bow-window were intimately well known, but it was as though they belonged to another world, a world at one or two removes, and as though their inhabitants, walking, laughing, talking out[…]”</i> </blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>‘Two roast-beefs to see you, sir,' said an orderly.<br/>'Oh no!' cried Captain Christy-Pallière, 'not at this hour, holy name. Tell them I am not here, Jeannot. I may be back at five. Who are they?'<br/>'The first is Aubrey, Jacques. He claims to be a captain in their navy,' said the orderly, narrowing his eyes and scanning the official slip in his hand. 'Born 1 April 1066, at Bedlam, London. Father's profession, monk: mother's, nun. Mother's maiden name, Borgia, Lucrèce. The other pilgrim is Maturin, Etienne -'<br/>'Quick, quick,' cried Captain Christy-Pallière. 'My breeches, Jeannot, my cravat -' for ease and commodity he had been sitting in his drawers. 'Son of a whore, my shirt. Penhoet, we must have a real dinner today - find a clothes-brush, Jeannot - this is the English prisoner I was telling you about. Excellent seaman, charming company. You will not mind speaking English, of course. How do I look?'<br/>'So pimping as possible,' said Captain Penhoet in that language. 'Camber the torso, and you will impose yourself of their attention. </i> </blockquote><br/><br/>But all the foxhunting and marriage chitchat does derail things a lot. A perfect summary of Jack’s foolish idea of romance, which is still the default one:<br/><blockquote><i>It occurred to him that he should put some order into his thoughts about these two [women]. Yet there was something so very odious, so very grossly indecent, in making any sort of comparison, in weighing up, setting side by side, evaluating. Stephen blamed him for being muddle-headed, wantonly muddle-headed, refusing to follow his ideas to their logical conclusion. 'You have all the English vices, my dear, including muddle-headed sentiment and hypocrisy.' Yet it was nonsense to drag in logic where logic did not apply. To think clearly in such a case was inexpressibly repugnant: logic could apply only to a deliberate seduction or to a marriage of interest.</i> </blockquote><br/>O’Brian does the following often (a quick cut, or object transition, or something):<br/><blockquote><i>‘If you are to see the First Lord in the morning, your mind must be in a condition of easy complaisance, in a placid, rested state. There is milk in the little crock - warmed milk will relax the fibres.'<br/><br/>Jack warmed it, added a dash of rum from his case-bottle, and drank it up; but in spite of his faith in the draught, the fibres remained tense, the placidity of mind a great way off.</i> </blockquote><br/><br/>The first paragraph is at a party; the second is back at home, with the farewells, cloakroom, cab-hailing, ride, and key-fumbling all elided. Jack has warped through the mention of milk, to the milk. So simple, but because it demands an inference it slows me down and gives me a lift, once or twice a chapter. Flatters the reader, saves on boring exposition, and provides a visual click, all in one.<br/><br/>Not impressed with Villiers yet.<br/><blockquote><i>Even a frigid, self-sufficing man needs something of this interchange if he is not to die in his unmechanical part: natural philosophy, music, dead men's conversation, is not enough...<br/><br/>It was not that he did not like the land - capital place; such games, such fun - but the difficulties there, the complications, were so vague and imprecise, reaching one behind another, no end to them: nothing a man could get hold of. Here, although life was complex enough in all conscience, he could at least attempt to cope with anything that turned up. Life at sea had the great advantage that - something was amiss.</i></blockquote>",,,1,0

Or the interesting: “depicting old fun, old morals, matters of grave importance (marriage, war) with irony and humour, status regulation, the sheer work of getting along with others”. explosions, to boot.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>The seamen, sprawling abroad on the fo’c’sle and combing out their long hair or plaiting it up again for one another, kindly explained to the landmen that this long swell from the south and east, this strange sticky heat that came both from the sky and the glassy surface of the heaving sea, and this horribly threatening appearance of the sun, meant that there was to be a coming dissolution of all natural bonds, an apocalyptic upheaval, a right dirty night.<br/></i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Brutal, too. The jolly crew, so kind and deferential to Stephen, are invariably wasted and criminal on shore (“<i>the Sophies were much given to rapine</i>”) And the heroic, witty, sensitive officers are pretty bloodthirsty (“<i>burning for the uproar and the more than human liberation of a battle</i>”). That’s what you get when you hire or abduct a hundred killers and pen them in with 2 pints of rum a day.<br/><br/>Prose is curious: both smooth and obscure. But he’s a master all right.<br/><blockquote><i>Stephen could remember an evening when he had sat there in the warm, deepening twilight, watching the sea; it had barely a ruffle on its surface, and yet the Sophie picked up enough moving air with her topgallants to draw a long straight whispering furrow across the water, a line brilliant with unearthly phosphorescence, visible for quarter of a mile behind her. Days and nights of unbelievable purity. Nights when the steady Ionian breeze rounded the square mainsail – not a brace to be touched, watch relieving watch – and he and Jack on deck, sawing away, sawing away, lost in their music, until the falling dew untuned their strings. And days when the perfection of dawn was so great, the emptiness so entire, that men were almost afraid to speak.<br/></i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><i>“It seems to me that the greater mass of confusion and distress must arise from these less evident divergencies – the moral law, the civil, military, common laws, the code of honour, custom, the rules of practical life, of civility, of amorous conversation, gallantry, to say nothing of Christianity for those that practise it. All sometimes, indeed generally, at variance; none ever in an entirely harmonious relation to the rest; and a man is perpetually required to choose one rather than another, perhaps (in his particular case) its contrary. It is as though our strings were each tuned according to a completely separate system – it is as though the poor ass were surrounded by four and twenty mangers”<br/></i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>People are in it for Jack and Stephen. JA is a big kind lunk, thinks he’s wittier than he is. On deciding to test out his new cannon:<br/><blockquote><i>“I think we can have a couple of rounds: God knows how long these charges have been lying in the guns. Besides,’ he added in a voice within his inner voice – a voice from a far deeper level, ‘think of the lovely smell.”<br/></i><br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>“I have been thinking about Dillon all day. All day long I have been thinking about him, off and on. You would scarcely credit how much I miss him... Dillon was Irish. Though you would never have thought so – never to be seen drunk, almost never called anyone out, spoke like a Christian, the most gentleman-like creature in the world, nothing of the hector at all – oh Christ. My dear fellow, my dear Maturin, I do beg your pardon. I say these damned things … I regret it extremely.”<br/></i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>SM is a cool moody Irish intellectual, quick with a bonesaw, and actually witty.<br/><blockquote><i>“The thing is officially called the trial of the captain, officers and ship’s company...; but obviously in this it is only my conduct that is in question. You have nothing to worry about, I do assure you, upon my word and honour. Nothing at all.’<br/>‘Oh, I shall plead guilty at once,’ said Stephen. ‘And I shall add that I was sitting in the powder-magazine with a naked light at the time, imagining the death of the King, wasting my medical stores, smoking tobacco and making a fraudulent return of the portable soup. What solemn nonsense it is’ – laughing heartily... After a longish pause Jack said, ‘You do not rate post-captains and admirals very high among intelligent beings, I believe? I have heard you say some tolerably severe things about admirals, and great men.’<br/>“Why, to be sure, something sad seems to happen to your great men and your admirals, with age, pretty often: even to your post-captains. A kind of atrophy, a withering-away of the head and the heart. I conceive it may arise from…”<br/></i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Almost every page at sea has some new jargon, most of it lovely. You will need <a href=""http://wiki.hmssurprise.org/phase3/index.php/Category:Guide_for_the_Perplexed:All_Articles"">this</a>, even though some things are explained to landmen. O’Brian is intentionally making it difficult for us, so skip him if you don’t consent to an old snob messing with you.<br/><blockquote><i>“And then these futtock-plates at the rim here hold the dead-eyes for the topmast shrouds – the top gives a wide base so that the shrouds have a purchase: the top is a little over ten foot wide. It is the same thing up above. There are the cross-trees, and they spread the topgallant shrouds. You see them, sir? Up there, where the look-out is perched, beyond the topsail yard.’<br/>‘You could not explain this maze of ropes and wood and canvas without using sea-terms, I suppose. No, it would not be possible.’<br/>‘Using no sea-terms? I should be puzzled to do that, sir”<br/></i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>O’Brian goes onto my very short list of novelists who can write a philosopher character without accidentally making them a guru or a pseud.

Four books, bolted together in the manner of an undergraduate pulling an all-nighter. You can read it as pure <i>Treasure Island</i> / <i>Three Musketeers</i> pulp, if you squint. But underneath is a whole view of human nature, of French Restoration perversity, of class anxiety after the People have vented themselves, and minute details of how French society worked. It contains digressions on merchant shipping, stoner drivel, interest rates, Napoleon's legacy, the ethnography of Parisian opera-goers, Roman cab fare, made up nonsense about Tunisian royalty, optical telegraphs, and I love it. 100 characters. Fun and irreverent and grand and petty and solemn and nerdy. Like a city on wheels.<br/><blockquote><i> <br/>in your place I should say nothing of all these adventures. Your life story is a novel; and people, though they love novels bound between two yellow paper covers, are oddly suspicious of those which come to them in living vellum, even when they are as gilded as you are capable of being.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Published a chapter at a time, and Dumas was paid by the word, and it shows. But it shows in the other way too: this is a live thing. For once I don't begrudge you your abridged edition: half of this is superfluous. The first 30 chapters are best: joy, betrayal, madness, education, escape, redemption. And Albert is incredibly annoying, and gets 10 chapters. But c'mon, just do a chapter a night for 3 months.<br/><br/>You will put up with heavy telegraphing:<br/><blockquote><i> ""...I must go to Paris.”<br/>“Ah, really?—to Paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been there, Dantès?”<br/>“Yes.”<br/>“Have you business there?”<br/>“Not of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere...”<br/>“Yes, yes, I understand,” said Danglars, and then in a low tone, he added, “To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an idea—a capital idea! Ah; Dantès, my friend, you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship Pharaon;” then turning towards Edmond, who was walking away, “A pleasant journey,” he cried.<br/>“Thank you,” said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Buss' translation is immaculate. You occasionally see the strain of an odd idiom, but in the same way you see a master athlete flex to pull off something hard.<br/><br/>Dantès is a simple romantic hero; or a heartless villain, a vampire; or a revenant of the revolution. (He isn't a radical, <i>until he is punished for being one</i>.) Or as class anxiety. Dantès the pirate, Dantès the entryist, Dantès the stalker, Dantès the god. The book imagines a perfect impostor, who has learned all the contrived tricks of the aristocracy, and with bottomless pockets. A parvenu you can't detect. A nemesis you don't know about. Betrayal transforms him from a noble peasant to a vicious overlord.(I thought my class-war reading was a stretch until I learned who <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas-Alexandre_Dumas"">Dumas' dad</a> was. Dumas saw either side.)<br/><br/>Dantès is, for the latter 3/4 of the book, not good. This isn't a matter of interpretation: he owns slaves, loves executions, and deludes everyone around him with fake virtue and kindness! He is an obsessed agent of narrow justice, a perfect liar, and a 'vampire'. Another instance of how terrible and inhuman justice can be. The novel tacitly condemns Dantès from Chapter 30 onwards: outwardly he lacks feeling (is deadly pale). So we're <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/07/the-great-divide-emily-nussbaum"">bad fans</a>.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>Franz, meanwhile, was thinking about the extraordinary shudder that had passed through the whole of the Count of Monte Cristo’s body at the moment when he was more or less obliged to give Albert his hand. <br/></i></blockquote><br/>Internally, he rages - but to the point of moving entirely beyond passion. <i>Focus</i> as the opposite of emotion. He is a mastermind, an implausibly good planner and reasoner - all in the service of fatal romance.<br/><br/>* The central transformation of the book is much more extreme than <i>Pygmalion</i> or <i>My Fair Lady</i>.<br/><br/>* Its great lesson is that evil can result from <i>mild</i> vice: envy, whim, irritation. The great silly convenience of the plot is the perfect anti-correlation between virtue and success: all of the idle conspirators reach the heights of society for unrelated reasons.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>""I’m convinced that, sooner or later, a righteous man is rewarded and a wicked one punished.""<br/>""You're a man of the cloth, Monsieur l'Abbe,"" said Caderousse with a bitter look, ""and it's your job to say that. But everyone is free to disbelieve what you claim... [Ruin:] That's how God rewards virtue, Monsieur."" <br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i><br/>On the whole, M. de Villefort made and returned few visits... this was accepted in society, where it was attributed to the amount and gravity of the lawyer's business - when it was, in reality, deliberate arrogance, an extreme example of aristocratic contempt, in short, the application of the maxim: ‘Admire yourself and others will admire you', a hundred times more useful in our day than the Greek one: ‘Know thyself', now replaced by the less demanding and more profitable art of knowing others.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>and so Dantes' perfect uber-dickhead counter to Villefort:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>""despite your reputation as a superior being, you see everything from the vulgar and material point of view of society, beginning and ending with man, that is to say, the most restricted and narrow point of view that human intelligence can adopt.’ <br/><br/>‘I beg you to explain yourself, sir,’ said Villefort, more and more astonished. I don’t entirely follow...’ <br/><br/>‘What I’m saying, sir, is that your eyes are fixed on the social organisation of nations that means that you only see the mechanism and not the sublime worker who operates it. I'm saying that you only recognise in front of you and around you those office-holders whose accreditation has been signed by a minister or by the king and that your short-sightedness leads you to ignore those men whom God has set above office-holders, ministers and kings, by giving them a mission to pursue instead of a position to fill. This weakness is inherent in humans, with their feeble and inadequate organs. <br/><br/>Tobias mistook the angel who had just restored his sight for an ordinary young man. The nations mistook Attila, who would annihilate them, for a conqueror like other conquerors. It was necessary for both to reveal their celestial missions for them to be recognised - for one to say: “I'm the angel of the Lord”, and the other: “I’m the hammer of God”, for their divine essence to be revealed.’ <br/>‘Does this mean,' Villefort said, increasingly amazed and thinking he must be speaking to a visionary or a madman, ‘that you consider yourself to be like one of these extraordinary beings you have just mentioned?’ <br/>‘Why not?' Monte Cristo asked coldly. <br/>""Please forgive me, sir,"" Villefort continued in bewilderment, ""if when I called on you I was not aware that I was to be introduced to a man whose understanding and mind extend so far beyond the <br/>ordinary knowledge and usual cast of thought of mankind... it is not customary for those who enjoy the privilege of wealth to waste their time in social speculation and philosophical dreams that are rather designed to console those whom fate has deprived of the goods of the earth.""<br/></i></blockquote><br/>* The adults are corrupt, the youth innocent but trivially corruptible.<br/><br/>* The surprisingly good cartoon adaption, <i>Gankutsuou</i>, focusses on polymorphous homoerotic undertones barely present here. (It also has bad CGI battle robots.)<br/><br/>* Is it money that corrupts him, rather than betrayal and injustice? Dantès is still relatively virtuous, human in the events following his escape. But not when he passes from redeemer to revenant. <br/><blockquote><i><br/>three months earlier [he] had wanted nothing except freedom, felt already not free enough, but wanted wealth. It was not the fault of Dantès, but of God who, while limiting the power of man, has created in him infinite desires!<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>*<br/><blockquote><i><br/>he was paying the meal the compliment one would expect from a man condemned for four or five months to suffer Italian cooking (which is among the worst in the world).<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>* On being ransomed to a kidnapper, Luigi:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>'Signor Luigi,’ Albert continued, ‘are there any other formalities to be completed before we may take leave of Your Excellency?’<br/>‘None at all, sir,’ the bandit said. ‘You are as free as the air.’ <br/>‘In that case, I wish you a long life and good fortune. Come, gentlemen, come!’ <br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>* Word count word count word count:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>a man in a blue jacket, with silk buttons of the same colour, a white waistcoat crossed by a huge gold chain and hazel-coloured trousers, with a head of such black hair, worn so low above the eyebrows that it seemed hardly natural, being so inconsistent with those wrinkles on the forehead that it was unable to disguise; in short, a man of between 50 and 55, trying to look 40, put his head out of the window of a coupe with a baron's crown painted on its door, and sent his groom to enquire of the concierge whether the Count of Monte Cristo was at home. <br/><br/>As he waited, the man examined the exterior of the house, what could be seen of the garden and the livery of a few servants who might be observed coming and going - and did so with such close attention as to amount almost to impertinence. His eye was sharp, but with more cunning in it than wit or irony. <br/><br/>His lips were so thin that they vanished inside the mouth instead of protruding from it. Finally, the breadth and prominence of the cheekbones (an infallible sign of shrewdness), the retreating forehead, the bulging occiput which extended well beyond his wide and not in the least aristocratic ears, all contributed to give this gentleman (whom any ordinary person would have thought very respectable in view of his magnificent horses, the enormous diamond he wore in his shirt and the red ribbon that stretched from one buttonhole to another on his coat), a face which to a trained physiognomist betrayed an almost repulsive character.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>The book broadened my sense of Romanticism; previously I had a pretty shallow idea of it, as if 100 years of clever people would not produce interesting thoughts as well as pure emoting. Consider the ridiculous faculties and ingenuity of Abbe Faria (competence porn!). It's not about feelings, or, it doesn't begin and end in feeling. It's about will over circumstance, virtue over accident, doing whatever extreme things it takes, to drive a passion into the earth. Romanticism is ridiculous, but it doesn't care about being ridiculous.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>""Often we pass beside happiness without seeing it, without looking at it, or, even if we have seen and looked at it, without recognizing it... Your throne will be raised up on the mountain where Satan took Jesus. And, without having to pay him homage, without having to kiss his claw, you will be the sovereign master of all the kingdoms on earth.<br/><br/>Do not be content with just one experiment: as with everything, the senses must become accustomed to a new impression, whether it is pleasant or not, happy or sad. Nature wrestles with this divine substance, because our nature is not made for joy but clings to pain. Nature must be defeated in this struggle, reality must follow dreams; and then the dream will rule, will become the master, the dream will become life and life become a dream. What a difference is made by this transfiguration! When you compare the sorrows of real life to the pleasures of the imaginary one, you will never want to live again, only to dream for ever. When you leave your world for that of others, you will feel as if you have travelled from spring in Naples to winter in Lapland, from paradise to earth, from heaven to hell. Try some hashish, my friend! Try it!""<br/></i></blockquote>",,,1,0

It’s not that his suffering isn’t real, it’s not even that it’s necessarily much less intense than people with harder jobs, no jobs, back-breaking jobs, entirely abstract and zero-feedback jobs. But to write about the misery of your easy meaningless labour - even this well - without a moment of perspective is an artistic and spiritual failure. But it’s a great failure and I appreciate his heartlessness, narcissism, his latent Marxism foiled by apathy, his Romanticism scuttled by irony. It’s a logical tantrum, even when the gerbil king tells him to kill himself.<br/><br/>We hear no one but him; they are mute while he is unceasing. These stories are intended as horror without monsters (observe the lettering font he uses, or the mouthlessness or literal voicelessness of the characters). What would self-awareness cost him? His “being above this”, “being underemployed”, being an “(overproduced) elite” are not the only view of the arrangement, or even a very good one. <br/><blockquote><i><br/>All of the days should be mine.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Anyway aren’t corporate jobs dreadful. Nicholson comes up with my favourite ever image for the feeling of alienated work: resting to recover your “juice”, only to be stabbed the next day with multiple taps to drain it from you, a finite flow that also drives your personal projects. <br/><blockquote><i><br/>The company won two-thirds of my life, and drained the juices from my driven flesh for its own needless product.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>The alcoholism chapter is very moving, very degraded.<br/><br/>The artist characters have no mouths; only the salespeople and the boss have them, big grins six inches tall.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>A hatred was in her voice that would take a grip of your inner organs.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Anyway this is best in its class and even ends with acceptance(?)(?) of a 20 year career in Geographical Info Systems(?). Probably avoid if you’re currently in a shit job.",,,1,0

Focusing is now a worldwide network... this can seem insane to the rest of our society. How could new realistic ideas and steps arise from the body? This new institution is changing the atomization of society... Unlocking the wisdom of your body... using the body's own life-centered and inherently positive direction and force...<br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>'Focusing has been crucial for many bodyworkers. I would hope that it would be more widely integrated within the education of Somatics practitioners.</i> - Don Hanlon Johnson, Professor, California Institute of Integral Studies'<br/></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>The most important rule for a therapist to observe, while helping someone to focus, is to stay out of the focuser's way... [Soon:] Another agitated, self-destructive emotional spiral was beginning and I interrupted her.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>IF DURING THESE INSTRUCTIONS SOMEWHERE YOU HAVE SPENT A LITTLE WHILE SENSING AND TOUCHING AN UNCLEAR HOLISTIC BODY SENSE OF THIS PROBLEM, THEN YOU HAVE FOCUSED.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>...but also things I know to be true and which aren't in the interest of a therapist / self-help guru to say:<br/><blockquote><i>Why doesn't therapy succeed more often? In the rarer cases when it does succeed, what is it that those patients and therapists do? What is it that the majority fail to do? <br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>When the revolution in self-help [democratization] takes place and people do these helpful processes with each other, will professional psychotherapy be unnecessary? <br/></blockquote></i><br/>It did take place, we are they; it didn't change much, because most of it is nonsense. I suppose it is cheaper than the old way.<br/>(There is of course the possibility that he's saying them to disarm me.)<br/><br/>I got incredibly annoyed at him going on about this 'method' for 50 pages without describing it; skip to chapter 4 if you do too. It's roughly<br/><br/>1) Clear your head<br/>2) Pick one problem and just think about it in general (""feel it holistically"")<br/>3) Slowly try to find the right words to describe it<br/>4) Switch back between the ""felt sense"" (2) and your description a bunch.<br/>5) Wonder what it's all about. <br/>6) Continue until you feel your attitude towards it change.<br/><br/>Is this profound? No. Is it crackpot? Also no.<br/><br/>Also annoying was his dismissing alternative strategies for handling problems, all of which I sometimes like. He belittles 'belittling the problem' (e.g. reminding yourself that others have it worse - which is both noble and effective); 'analyzing' (he rightly belittles Freudian Analysis, i.e. blaming your present state on the nastiest past event that comes to mind, but <i>as if</i> breaking things into subproblems is always a bad idea); just enduring it (often just works for me); lecturing yourself (often works for me because parts of me want to listen). Why is it so hard for writers like this to concede that some things don't work for some people? (They lose authority I suppose.)<br/><br/>Surprising that he's a sincere empiricist, or at least trying to be. <br/><blockquote><i>One reason why research is so important is precisely that it can surprise you and tell you that your subjective convictions are wrong... As hard as it was for me to accept the finding that therapy doesn't do the job, research findings can never hurt you. They move you forward.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><a href=""http://www.focusing.org/research_basis.html"">This is a list</a> of about 100 studies on the topic (Ctrl+F ""Table 1""), no doubt with a terrible file-drawer problem. Total n~=500, probably with a lot of duplication. Measures used are a mix of standard boring ones like PFQ and woo boring ones like Gestalt. <br/><br/>Gendlin makes a few specific, testable claims (which is always to be encouraged so allow me to hereby present him with his certificate of falsifiability at worst):<br/><br/>* ""therapy has better outcomes when clients 'focus"". Too vague, but a few of the studies are nominally about this.<br/>* ""better functioning of the immune system"". Only one mention of immune system in that big chart, for <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8126691"">this n=76 study</a>, no mention of focusing in the abstract at least.<br/>* successful patients (i.e. one-year outcomes) can be predicted from recordings of ""their first two sessions"". This would be good and clean evidence that something real is involved. I think the claim refers to <a href=""http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/ftp04/nq22908.pdf"">this PhD</a>, n=35. It wasn't exactly cross-validated, shall we say.<br/><br/>That review was cursory but tells me enough. (You might think you could just look at clinical practice, 40 years on - which, outside of California, doesn't exactly foreground Gendlin - to get a sense of whether it works as well as he claims. But medicine is too far from a rational system for that.)<br/><br/>The core idea is not insane. It's that there is an equivalent of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception"">proprioception</a> for your own emotions, and that you can't change anything about yourself except through it. There's a touch of the old Zen problem to it, that you're trying to describe a nonverbal thing in words. But then, most descriptions aren't descriptions of verbal processes - consider e.g. ""Succulent plants' dark fixation makes them ideal for air quality control in bedrooms"".<br/><br/>What about support from respectable, academic phenomenology? I don't know that there is any such thing. There <i>may</i> be non-propositional, non-procedural knowledge. It wouldn't be surprising - the conscious mind is a relatively small and unskilled thing. It's Gendlin's idea of our apriori and undeluded access to it that's the problem. Gendlin's experiments don't establish the existence or the access. I find it hard to think how to test this, actually. If the epistemology of focusing was real, what would be different about its practitioners? Happiness? Cortisol? Decision speed? I don't know. We are too skilled at deluding ourselves. It would be pretty easy to run an experiment where Gendlinites tried to predict which patients recover, and then check that against normies' predictions.<br/><br/>To be fair, this book isn't his strongest face (""<i>I also want this book to be readable by anyone</i>""). But I'm not grading on intended audience (and I wasn't encouraged by those no-power, pre-Crisis psychology studies either).<br/><br/>Open questions: why should there be any therapy that works in general? Grant that there is bodily knowledge; where is this knowledge stored? The enteric nervous system? Why should introspection work? Theory of mind is for modelling other people so that they can't harm me.<br/><br/>This is all probably harmless; people doing Rogerian listening to each other is unlikely to cause any problems (in fact, since it's free, then if the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict"">null hypothesis of talk psychotherapy</a> is true, this might be a social improvement; same benefit without the deadweight); he doesn't advocate withdrawal from treatment (pills are completely absent from the picture, actually). And the opportunity cost of trying this is low, because other self-help is worse. Not for me; maybe for you.<br/><br/>* Gendlin seems like a very nice man, he's just not the discoverer of the one neat trick to psychiatry. The emphasis (3 chapters) here on helping others and not just yourself in sweet. His acceptance of the need to do science makes it easier to get at him than at other self-helpists - which makes me feel bad about getting at him and not them. (I won't get at them because they're not worth arguing with.)",,,1,0

Everyone has fancy nanotechnology, which solves absolute poverty and allows massive structures to be built of solid diamond.<br/><br/>That's all in the background, where the foreground is a theory of education and rebellion, of social degeneration and regeneration. The leader of the Victorians designs the best educational game ever, a 12-year-long adventure game with live narration. He does this because there's a shortage of subversion and rebellion in his society, and he wants to train his granddaughter to be independent. (He also says the neo-Vickys have an associated shortage of great artists, but to put it mildly this is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Victorian_novelists"">not something</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_artists#Born_1800%E2%80%931899"">the originals</a> suffered.)<br/><br/>In particular, Stephenson was <a href=""http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html"">a bit</a> obsessed with moral relativism in the 90s; he harps on the superiority of realism, or communitarianism, or status regulation, or sincerity, or something, in most of his books. Superficially, his concern matches one annoying strain of internet writing of the last few years - the clickbait strawmaneering of the Petersons and the Lindsays. But French Theory <a href=""https://aeon.co/essays/french-thought-once-dazzled-the-world-what-went-wrong"">fell</a> in the meantime, outside of a few academic subcultures with little influence, so Stephenson can be right while these guys are wrong. An excess of scepticism and irony - a deficit of shaming and judgment - does not strike me as the first problem with the mores of 2020.<br/><br/>Stephenson saves most of the nice bits of the book for the Vickys, and his attempt to recover what was good about the original Victorians (their energy, inventiveness, duty, taste) ignores a lot of what was bad about them. (Though he actively endorses their hypocrisy about sex, he would have to think again about their betraying their Christian universalism with retributive justice and imperialism.)<br/><blockquote><i><br/>""when I was a young man, hypocrisy was deemed the worst of vices,"" Finkle-McGraw said. ""It was all because of moral relativism. You see, in that sort of a climate, you are not allowed to criticise others--after all, if there is no absolute right and wrong, then what grounds is there for criticism?...<br/><br/>""Now, this led to a good deal of general frustration, for people are naturally censorious and love nothing better than to criticise others' shortcomings. And so it was that they seized on hypocrisy and elevated it from a ubiquitous peccadillo into the monarch of all vices. For, you see, even if there is no right and wrong, you can find grounds to criticise another person by contrasting what he has espoused with what he has actually done... Virtually all political discourse in the days of my youth was devoted to the ferreting out of hypocrisy.""<br/><br/>""That we occasionally violate our own stated moral code,"" Major Napier said, working it through, ""does not imply that we are insincere in espousing that code."" <br/>""Of course not,"" Finkle-McGraw said. ""It's perfectly obvious, really.

I've seen people dismiss it as narrowly economic (""people value more than money ya know"") but this is stupid: fully half the book is about morals and culture. There are dozens of lovely little easter eggs in Weinersmith's art too (e.g. ""Conspicuone Pecansumption"" icecream).<br/><br/>The arguments:<br/><br/>1. Closed borders lead to incredible suffering - not just the obvious oppression of camps, raids, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/essex-lorry-deaths-tragic-political"">struggle</a> and drownings, but also the unnecessary perpetuation of poverty. <br/><br/>2. He argues that it's a human rights issue: ""<i>If a foreigner wants to accept a job offer from a willing employer or rent an apartment from a willing landlord, what moral right does anyone have to stop them? These are contracts between consenting adults, not welfare programs.</i>"" The regulation is an apartheid with comparatively little outcry and great popularity.<br/><br/>3. America had completely open borders until <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875"">1875</a> and comparatively-free undocumented immigration until <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924"">1924</a>. It did pretty alright.<br/><br/>4. Immigrants on average have been fiscally net-positive. Doing our best to isolate the effects, moving to a rich country seems to multiply your productivity. (For a few reasons: more co-operation, a larger market for your work, no tropical disease, coastal trade, IQ gain if you're young.) <a href=""https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.25.3.83"">This model</a> predicts trillions of dollars of gain from open borders. If true, this massively reduces global poverty.<br/><br/>5. Immigrants are on average culturally positive, allowing the recipient country to select from the best of everything in the world. The first generation are quite a bit more law-abiding than average natives. (Nowrasteh estimates that just <a href=""https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/terrorism-immigration-risk-analysis"">one in seven million</a> immigrants turned out to be a terrorist.) Assimilation is high, usually complete within 2-3 generations. ""Political externalities"" (the idea that your good culture will be voted out by bad culture once you let immigrants vote) have not in fact been seen.<br/><br/>Residual points:<br/><ul><br/> <li>The data is mostly from our current highly-restricted high-skill-only immigration regime. It's not clear which effects would change in the dramatically different world Caplan promotes, though he does his best to look at saturation effects and the low-skilled who are currently persecuted-out. (For instance, a large part of his cultural argument depends on the low-skilled continuing to not vote, as they haven't.)</li><br><br/> <li>The biggest risk by far is the damage caused by irrational native backlash against foreigners. This produces things like Brexit and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobbik"">Jobbik</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Party_of_Austria"">Austrian 'Freedom'</a> governments. Chapter 6 addresses some of this by suggesting ways to make things unfair for the migrants (limiting their welfare access, entry tolls, language tests, slow naturalisation) to mollify the local problems / backlash and so protect people's right to move in the first place. I glumly suspect this wouldn't work, because much of the backlash isn't based on real effects, and so can't be mollified by policy.

And a divisive book:<br/><br/>1) It is extremely focussed on men and masculine mindset - guts and brutality, mathematical facility, mind-numbing horniness, how shit works, emotional impermeability, pride in being a stereotype. (Scroll down to see reviews reacting in highly exaggerated ways to this fact, with either horror or delight.) <br/><blockquote><i>Men who believe that they are accomplishing </i>something<i> by speaking speak in a different way from men who believe that speaking is a waste of time... there might be a third category... [Waterhouse] speaks, not as a way of telling you a bunch of stuff he's already figured out, but as a way of making up a bunch of new shit as he goes along. And he always seems to be hoping that you'll join in. Which no one ever does.</blockquote></i><br/>On the wonder and absurdity of social etiquette:<blockquote><i>The room contains a few dozen living human bodies, each one a big sack of guts and fluids so highly compressed that it will squirt for a few yards when pierced. Each one is built around an armature of 206 bones connected to each other by notoriously fault-prone joints that are given to obnoxious creaking, grinding, and popping noises when they are in other than pristine condition. This structure is draped with throbbing steak, inflated with clenching air sacks, and pierced by a Gordian sewer filled with burbling acid and compressed gas and asquirt with vile enzymes and solvents produced by many dark, gamy nuggets of genetically programmed meat strung along its length. Slugs of dissolving food are forced down this sloppy labyrinth by serialized convulsions, decaying into gas, liquid, and solid matter which must all be regularly vented to the outside world lest the owner go toxic and drop dead. Spherical, gel-packed cameras swivel in mucus greased ball joints. Infinite phalanxes of cilia beat back invading particles, encapsulate them in goo for later disposal. In each body a centrally located muscle flails away at an eternal, circulating torrent of pressurized gravy. And yet, despite all of this, not one of those bodies makes a single sound during the sultan's speech.</blockquote></i><br/>Half of this is an accurate portrayal of 40s gender politics, half a defensive reaction to contemporary blank-slateism. I don't think it's a malign kind of masculinity, though there are only a couple of female characters who don't have at least peripheral or inverted sexiness - if you can't handle that I'd avoid it. A good point to bail out would be the bit where Waterhouse models the effect of masturbation vs sex on his cognition as a periodic timeseries. I'm very hard to offend, but the <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/04/style-guide-not-sounding-like-an-evil-robot/"">constant use</a> of ""females"" got to me, by page 400.<br/><blockquote><i>Randy stares directly into the eyes of the female customs official and says, ""The Internet."" Totally factitious understanding dawns on the woman’s face, and her eyes ping bosswards. The boss, still deeply absorbed in an article about the next generation of high-speed routers, shoves out his lower lip and nods, like every other nineties American male who senses that knowing this stuff is now as intrinsic to maleness as changing flat tires was to Dad. ""I hear that’s really exciting now,"" the woman says in a completely different tone of voice, and begins scooping Randy’s stuff together into a big pile so that he can repack it. Suddenly the spell is broken, Randy is a member in good standing of American society again, having cheerfully endured this process of being ritually goosed by the Government.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>2) It is also a partisan in the Arts vs STEM ""culture war"". (In fact Stephenson is often dismissive of all academia - ""<i>grad students existed not to learn things but to relieve the tenured faculty members of tiresome burdens such as educating people and doing research</i>"".) One of the most important scenes in the book shows a lone techie clashing with a self-appointed jury of stereotypically appalling critical theorists: they speak nonsense about an objective matter, he correctly calls them on it, they cover him in ad hominem bulverism until he gives in. It's not without nuance: his champion in the fight Randy is later shown sulking and reliving it and admitting his own pettiness:<br/><blockquote><i>“I strenuously object to being labeled and pigeonholed and stereotyped as a technocrat,” Randy said, deliberately using oppressed-person’s language maybe in an attempt to turn their weapons against them but more likely (he thinks, lying in bed at three A.M. in the Manila Hotel) out of an uncontrollable urge to be a prick.</i></blockquote> <br/><br/>3) There are a lot of coincidences, much more than the novelistic baseline. Characters meet Atanasoff and Turing and Reagan and MacArthur. (A Nazi submarine captain makes a sneering reference to a bureaucratic nightmare being something out of ""that Jew Kafka"". I thought this was an absurd anachronism, but looking into it, the Nazi could easily have read him, but could not have made the reference to a Brit and expected it to stick. English translation of <i>Das Schloss</i> in 1930 but it didn't take off until after the war.) This is cute/trite on its own, but I find it helpful to imagine Stephenson looking down at history, selecting a <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/Littlewood"">particularly interesting sub-graph</a> from the population<br/><br/>4) There are lots of info-dumps. Large sections of this are indistiguishable from nonfiction. (""<i>This pause is called the horizontal retrace interval. Another one will occur...</i>"") People seem to hate this, but it is fine since it's done through aspie characters who absolutely do talk like that.<br/><br/>5) It has a lot of pulpy Feats, fuck-yeah setpieces which fiction this good usually foregoes.     Tropical headhunters; escape from a collapsing mineshaft; cryptocurrency in the 90s; tactical blackface; drinking and lolling with your Nazi captors; etc.<br/><blockquote><i>It would be an idyllic tropical paradise of not for the malaria, the insects, the constant diarrhea and resulting hemorrhoids, and the fact that the people are dirty and smell bad and deat each other and use human heads for decoration.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>It's easy to miss the uniting theme, and thus call it ""not a novel"" or whatever, because it only unmasks on p.791. It is Ares v Athena, rage v cunning, politics v engineering, normies v geeks, law v ethics, <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/"">conflict v mistake</a>, local maxima v the search for the global. This overloaded binary is embodied in Andrew v Randy, the Dentist v Avi, Rudy v Göring, All of Japan v Dengo.<br/><br/>Now, it suits me to have litigious bastards and culture-warriors be the inheritors of Ares, of mindless destruction. But it would be silly to think that the stakes are comparable between the plot strands: it's WWII vs the Struggles of Some Cool Crypto Entrepreneurs. But Stephenson is obviously not equating them, and might be pointing out that stakes are now in general lower, even when you're up against contemporary gangsters.<br/><br/>Another giant theme is the emergence of one new masculinity, beyond the taciturn physical hero: the geek. This is the ""third category"" above. (Is this really that new? Isn't it just the Scholar?)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><i>Misc notes</i><br/><br/>* Waterhouse seems to be taking <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Tutte"">Bill Tutte</a>'s space in history and seizing it for America but ok.<br/><br/>* Bobby Shaftoe is the noblest junkie character I've ever seen - ingenious in his pursuit of morphine, but slightly more keen on Marine honour than on it.<br/><br/>* I was not expecting Stephenson to use <i>converting to Christianity</i> as the symbol for Dengo leaving sick ultranationalism behind. Compassion and liberalism are far larger and better than the Christian launchpad they happened to use, after all.<br/><br/>* Relatedly there's his preference for cute family-values Christianity over postmodern critical theory:<br/><blockquote><i>To translate it into UNIX system administration terms (Randy’s fundamental metaphor for just about everything), the post-modern, politically correct atheists were like people who had suddenly found themselves in charge of a big and unfathomably complex computer system (viz, society) with no documentation or instructions of any kind, and so whose only way to keep the thing running was to invent and enforce certain rules with a kind of neo-Puritanical rigor, because they were at a loss to deal with any deviations from what they saw as the norm. Whereas people who were wired into a church were like UNIX system administrators who, while they might not understand everything, at least had some documentation, some FAQs and How-tos and README files, providing some guidance on what to do when things got out of whack. </blockquote></i><br/><br/>* Some surprisingly deft notes on kink and the exogenous/preconscious nature of sexuality, in the bit where they're spying on Tom Howard.<br/><br/>* This line accurately portrays the mindset of certain wizard types like Turing:<br/><blockquote><i>It is exciting to discover electrons and figure out the equations that govern their movement; it is boring to use those principles to design electric can openers.</i></blockquote><br/>though it is discreditable and nongeneralisable to hold.<br/><br/>* I learned a lot of words. <br/><br/>* There are dozens and dozens of depictions of Japanese war crimes before we get any note paid to the horrendous suffering of the Japanese troops. But after that it is suitably even-handed in its tragedy. One of the saddest sentences I've ever read: ""They are strafing the survivors"".<br/><br/>* Root is a tech determinist about the war - the Allies won because their tech was better, end-of. I seriously doubt historians would go with this. <br/><br/>* <spoiler>I struggle to fit Root into the world. His death and reappearance is the only magical element in the entire thing (coincidences aside), and clashes with the main bloody theme. I am toying with the idea that Root is a collective name like James Bond, but I suppose it'll just be some switcheroo bullshit.</spoiler><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>There's a lot wrong with it - it's about twice as long as it needs to be, the gender stuff is overdone, it is intentionally annoying to its outgroup, succumbing to 'conflict theory', and none of its antagonists (Loeb, the Dentist, Wing, Crocodile) are fleshed out <i>despite him having 900 pages of opportunities for fleshing them</i> -  but it's grand, clever, full of ideas, funny, full of great setpieces, and foresaw a couple of things about our decade.",,,1,0

Neither is easy: someone like Montaigne manages easily, but e.g. Rousseau doesn't (he just got there first, to the I Am Art game, so we have to talk about him).<br/><br/>Joyce's life is only mildly interesting from the outside, so it falls to his evocation. I read this to find out whether to care about him, and I actually didn't until Part III, the rightly famous spiritual arc from apatheistic teenage kicks, to the ecstatic shame of submitting to the vast closed Catholic system, and through it to passionate agnosticism, anticlerical naturalism. Joyce's is the best portrait of the infinite terrorism of the Church:<br/><blockquote><i>remember, my dear boys, that we have been sent into this world for one thing and for one thing alone: to do God’s holy will and to save our immortal souls. All else is worthless.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light laughter of a girl reached his burning ear. The frail, gay sound smote his heart more strongly than a trumpet blast, and, not daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked, into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma appeared before him and under her eyes the flood of shame rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind had subjected her or how his brute-like lust had torn and trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank under his very nostrils.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>As a teen Stephen tries to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortification_of_the_flesh"">mortify</a> himself, to not look at women, to not eat well, to just look at <a href=""http://dylanmoran.tumblr.com/post/511317711/i-grew-up-in-ireland-you-know-you-learn-to-feel"">the mud</a>. But he's too bright, too worldly and too proud. I cheered at the end of Part IV, when he throws off the yoke.<br/><br/>The prose is port wine: lovely if sipped. It is mostly monologue but the dialogue is the best bit. He is passionate about anything, e.g. algebra - <br/><blockquote><i>The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's; and, when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated, began slowly to fold itself together again. The indices appearing and disappearing were eyes opening and closing; the eyes opening and closing were stars being born and being quenched. The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying him outward and inward. What music? The music came nearer and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness. The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space.<br/><br/>The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the bale-fire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>The painful process of moving past family, nation, church, scholastic philosophy, to become yourself. Doing this in a country as maniacal about nation and church as eC20th Ireland was so much harder, and indeed he had to leave. He doesn't move past Art, and acquires a similarly  monomanaical view of it -<br/><blockquote><i>[To be an artist], a priest of the eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life<br/></blockquote></i><br/>but if my prose was as good as Joyce's maybe I couldn't have moved past it either. Like Nietzsche if he wasn't an edgelord.<br/><br/>That printers and governments treated Joyce and Lawrence the same is a laugh: Joyce has all of Lawrence's passion and none of the flat feet. Self-parody, odd humility, laughter at his own past dogmatism.<br/><br/>His memory - or his notetaking? - is amazing: scholars have spent lifetimes checking and relating <i>everything</i> in this to recorded history, and he's usually spot on about details (though he changes names). I don't think I could write anything as accurate, even in my surveillance society. <br/><br/>Fully half of my edition was taken up in footnotes and bibliophilia. (It also left Joyce's typos in, which is a bit much. In fact half the footnotes were as trivial as typos, e.g. pointing out where lines are reused from his draft <i>Stephen Hero</i>.)<br/><br/><i>Portrait</i> stops before the end of uni, before his <a href=""https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/culture/why-james-joyce-had-to-leave-dublin-to-find-himself-1-5071133"">odyssey</a>, before his wife even.

Surprisingly, he also disses expected value (first-order users of which are ""educated fools"") with the trivial fact that infinities are strange: ""<i>Perhaps the ultimate repudiation of expected value is the abstract possibility of tickets [promising infinite payoff but only asymptotically]</i>"". Luckily decision theory is larger than one rule, and nowhere says that you must ignore your budget (+ leverage) and blindly obey the result of one multiplication...

The Steelypips are worried, they         don’t understand a thing, meanwhile Trurl uses special delivery registered C.O.D., certified with return receipt, or, best of all, remittance due and         payable in full- he sends out no end of dunning letters, bills of lading,         notices, injunctions, and there are already special accounts set up, no entries         at the moment but he says that’s only temporary. After a while, you can see that        that is not quite so hideous, especially in profile - it’s actually gotten smaller!-yes, yes, it is smaller!

Marco Pierre-White) - writes about his childhood in a brutal panoptic manner. His unsentimentality about himself, his mother, his horrible uncles, is startling, even speaking as a fan of <a href=""http://meadesshrine.blogspot.com/p/shrine.html"">his sarky and acid programmes</a>. It's not exactly linear: there are several odd repetitions and filling-ins, mimicking the meandering of memory. Still, Meades' prose makes them worthwhile twice over:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>When, after they had both died, I sold my parents' house, I got rid of a cupboardful of toys which had collected decades' dust, and a bookcase of Eagle annuals, Tiger annuals, Buffalo Bill annuals and so on. I picked through tins of broken pens and perished erasers. I excitedly anticipated the past to come rushing back. Each of these rusty, tarnished pieces of metal or plastic is, surely, a potential madeleine, a mnemonic of some bright day in 1959. They were, however, doggedly mute.<br/><br/>It took time in that house whose purpose was finished to realise that this was a pitiful and self-pitying exercise: I was trying to freeze myself, to transport myself back to the land of lost content which had, actually, been no such thing. I was trying to do to myself what parents do to their children.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i><br/>No girls meant no calm solicitude, no sweet fragrance of talc and cleanliness, but, rahter, the soilpipe smell of almost a hundred shrieking, blubbing, chucking, grubby, boisterous, energetic, savage, merciless small boys... Kissing was of course sissy. In the Cathedral School's swimming-pool changing hut, a riot of asbestos, just-prepubescent boys boxed with their penises in friendly companionabiity and competitive violence: he who drew blood won. They aptly dignified this as 'cockfighting', insouciantly associating covert pugilism with the hedgerow gamblers' sport conducted between roofless brick cowsheds where flames from pyres of palettes relieve the ruined farmyard's midden chill and lend ceremony to the bucolic rite.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>Some fleshpot, Southampton: the Port Said of the Solent. A poor whore has only to sit in a window in Derby Road, and a major police operation will be launched. All the coppers who've been on Cottage Patrol squeeze out from beneath the rafter to race a mile east from the Common. Their route takes them past Great Aunt Doll's chaotic bungalow where there were peals of dirty laughter and sweet sherry and sweet Marsala, and a room heated to eighty degrees and fish and chips for a dozen in an enamel bowl, and gossip and ribbing and silly stories, and gaspers, and will someone let the dog out else he's going to wee on the couch, and Jonathan you better go with him if you want a widdle cos Eric's been and done a big one...<br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i><br/>I had emerged [from Sunday School] a materialist. It was, equally, the first time I had walked out of anything, that I had had the nerve to walk out. Thus was a lifelong habit initiated. Cinemas, jobs, sexual relationships, exams, opportunities, marriages, commitments, professional partnerships, schools, theatrical performances (a specialty), parties, expeditions, dinners, homes, prior arrangements - I've walked out of them all, often.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>The whole book is anomalous - it is sustained emotional recollection by a professed enemy of nostalgia:<br/><blockquote><i>Nostalgia is not simply a yearning for a lost home, a yearning which can never be satisfied by revisiting that home, which could only be satisfied by becoming once more the child who inhabited that home, at that time. It is also primitive, pre-rational, pre-learning. It quashes developed taste, aesthetic preference, learnt refinements. It insists that the chance associations of infancy are more obstinately enduring than the chosen positions of our subsequent sentience. It tells us that we are lifers in a mnemonic prison from which there is no reprieve.</blockquote></i><br/>But then the man's an anomaly: a razorish rationalist, a scathing positivist about the arts, who has devoted his life to them. (<i>They were accompanied by their arty and - it follows - entirely artless friends.</i>)<br/><br/>    His childhood was not like other children's in Fifties Britain. (I'm comparing his to Bennett, Hitchens, wrongly also Clive James.) His parents quietly rewarded his not conforming, and he ate Afghan curry throughout (his father was stationed in Iraq and brought back a tonne of spices). He grew up surrounded by clergy and the weapons scientists of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porton_Down"">Downs</a>:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>I pictured the Red Menace - a cannibalistic giant whose face was impasted with human gristle and blood; bullnecked mass murderers weighed down by medals; cloud seeding; barbed wire; secret policemen; evil scientists; informers; torturers; factories as big as cities; insanitary collective farms; starvation; deportations. 'You're going to Siberia!' was a playground taunt of the Fifties.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>(He really likes the biological warfare men, in maybe the biggest piece of contrarianism in this large contrary book.)<br/><br/>The book stops when he's only 17 - but there are so, so many deaths in it. Maybe 70, counting the drowned calf; my total by that age was 3. Let's say he delights in the <i>contrast</i> with today, not in the deaths themselves.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>For all they spoke of death, I might have believed we live perpetually, growing ever more crooked, more and more dried up, more rasping, more fearful. (I obviously didn't know that it was death's proximity that caused the eyes of the very old to communicate unimaginable terror.) ...The names of the dead were dropped from conversation, as one might drop that of a disloyal friend. Death seemed to be a kind of disgrace... The rare times they were remembered, it was with irked brusqueness.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>    It is <i>very</i> easy to put him in a bad light; he makes it easy for you, because he is always absolutely emphatic, usually vitriolic, and often wrong. (The things he's wrong about include vegetarians, anti-racism overall*, arguably human rights.**) <br/><blockquote><i>Where would we be without monotheism, fasts, judicial impartiality, the eucharist, sincerity, pork's proscription, Allah's ninety-nine names and seventy-two virgins, weather forecasts, life plans, political visions, conjugated magpies, circumcision, sacred cows, the power of prayer, insurance policies, gurus' prescriptions, the common good, astrology? Where indeed? But those are the big lies. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>Picturing the equine Princess Royal is a sure way of inhibiting orgasm and prolonging enjoyment, so long as one doesn't picture her for too long and so risk flaccidity.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>stoical meiosis was normal in a generation which denied itself deep immersion in feeling, had not learned to wallow in empathy, understood an outpouring to be the discharge of cloacal sewage. The lexicon of demonstrative care had yet to be coined; the people's absurd princess had yet to be born; the mistakenly unaborted Blair had yet to perfect the catch of tremulous sincerity in his voice.</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>my mother had assured me that the old testament was risible tosh. And so it is. So, of course, are all 'holy' books. But risible tosh can be persuasive.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>The desert landscape [in Iraq] is relentlessly grim. There was indigenous hostility to contend with. The Arab world was broadly sympathetic to the Axis powers. (The Nazis' successors are not the lost causists of the BNP, NPD and Vlaams Belang but the totalitarian Islamist post-Khomeini terror states... The Arab armies included Bosnian Muslim veterans of the Handzar SS brigades... The entire sentimental Arabist package, the tradition of the fawning British buggerocracy - Richard Burton, T.E. Lawrence, St John Philby, Glubb Pasha, Wilfred Thesiger and countless other aristocratic eccentrics - had become <i>la pensee unique</i> of the army's higher strata. It was also (not that its adherents acknowledged it) effete, misogynistic, irrational, anti-urban, Luddite and gullible.</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>Antiquarian pillage is hardly scholarly and far from scientific, but its perpetrators were not culpable of the misanthropic relativism which grants rights to ancient amphorae and entitlements to yokes' remnants. Nor did they conceive of history in terms of movements, big ideas and sweeping theses. Their empiricism militated against generalisation.</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>The tyranny of minorities had caused the atomisation of England. The damage is repairable - by state terror or mob rule. But since the state's treasonable clerks are the very cause of the embuggerance we can be sure that it will do nothing. And a mob needs a leader to bring its hatred to the boil, foment its venom, drive it on. It needs the Duke of Edinburgh. Much as he might wish it he won't be around.</blockquote></i><br/>Consider that last one: it is natural to read in it a fascist glee - but it isn't that at all. It is rather the dread of inevitable deadlock and looming contradictions. There's no relish, only misplaced fear. But you need to have read his contempt of fascists (and of Philip) and his fear of totalitarianism <i>before</i>, for it to sound like that.<br/><br/>Why isn't the cannibal internet calling him out? Because he is in the grey zone of non-celebrity? Because he is too old to shame? Because he isn't on Twitter? Anyway: He is neither a bigot (offensive because hateful and ignorant), nor a clickbait troll (intentionally, insincerely offensive), nor an aged victim of social drift (obliviously offensive): he has not defaulted to these opinions; he was never much tied to his time's prevailing prejudices, whether it's Fifties' conformism and class obsession or Noughties PC and pomo. His antipathies are reasoned and he refuses to pander. Compare this passage to e.g. what Yiannopoulos was finally banished for:<br/><blockquote><i>The formula states that adults are wicked predators, children are innocent prey. In the hierarchy of abuse, paedophilia (which may be literally that, liking children) is demonised, fetishised. It has giddily attained equal status with race crime... Homo faber. Isn't he just? Man has devised multitudinous forms of child abuse which are not sexual. Their immeasurable consequences may, however, be just as grave as those of sexual abuse. <br/><br/>Child soldier, child slave, child labourer, child miner, child skiv, child beggar, child bloody from scrounging in the shambles.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>The book is highly abridged (only up to cram school) and still a bit too long. Before reading this you should first watch <a href=""http://meadesshrine.blogspot.com/p/shrine.html"">any 10 of these films</a>.<br/><br/><br><br/>* If you insist on challenging the worst e.g. woke, <a href=""https://www.glamour.com/story/kim-kardashian-braids-explanation"">trivial</a> internet activism, you have to say that's what you're against: Meades is being uncharacteristically imprecise, and decimating sympathy as a result. ""Against (actually-existing) anti-racism"" is not the same as ""pro-racism"", but people will read you that way unless you give them explicit reason not to. (And even then.)<br/><br/>** Rights are only good if they produce good outcomes; lots of people all over the world think in terms of imperatives and absolutes and it is almost futile to argue about it; thus rights can be a useful fiction. Meades again spits on ""rights"" in general without laying out this or any other philosophical objection, without showing us what he's for and so allowing people to not think the worst.",,,1,0

Art about code. So this is conceptualism that I don't immediately despise.<br/><br/>    (A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)"">closure</a> is a neat piece of code that can remember what has happened, knows what's going on outside, beyond what the code explicitly mentions.)<br/><br/>We get dead-format nostalgia, memery, a handwritten stretch of Ruby, and reflections on feeling inferior to Franz Kafka, of all people.<br/><br/>    _why has a unique voice. That is a banal thing to say, but it is true here as I suspect it is not elsewhere. There are only two technical passages, one litany of relief from enterprise development, and one entire module in handwriting.<br/><br/>    There is torment. Keep up the names: he is the Simon Weil, the Tristram Shandy of web development, the DFW of running out of ritalin. Unquiet introversion.<br/><blockquote><br/>Can anyone that has had a blog be called private? (Where are all the introverts these days? Technology has upgraded introverts into - soft extroverts I guess.)<br/></blockquote><br/> Here are his self-hating notes in the margin of his beautiful, kind comment on Shymalan's <i>The Happening</i>:<br/><blockquote>    <br/>   Perhaps the greatest pain of talking about art is how shallow it is compared to the actual experience of watching movie/song/etc...    previously I had criticized the kinds of small talk discussions, particularly discussions about music, because they revolved around ""Did you like this? Have you heard that?"" and never went anywhere beyond that... <br/><br/>Those pointless discussions that had always left me feeling empty, never able to talk about the beauty of music itself adequately, just the names and the styles... But why would anyone want to have a meaningful discussion all the time?<br/><br/>        In a way I feel that's the point of being candid. To expose how shameful I am.<br/></blockquote><br/>    Wilfully awkward, marginal, analogue.     He calls himself the Professor, as an insult.<br/>The PDF is of images, not text: you cannot copy anything without putting in the effort. Old misaligned book scans, dumb Gorey cartoon jokes, an itemized grocery bill, astute literary notes on Kafka, Ishiguro, Gaiman. He lives now with extreme thrift and extreme technophobia, slamming down his friend's phone when she browses it during conversation. He makes seawater bread instead of web apps. <br/><br/>The harsh jump-cut absurdism between the sketches is not genuine - they are all linked. Not sure what by, but I say so.<br/><blockquote>        <br/>I must strictly require you that, if you are to continue reading and go with me on this sally, that you resist from looking up anything to do with the book SACRED CLOWNS. This is paramount. I know the urge must be incredible to go out with your smartphones and to find out if the book is real, but I must INSIST that you just let it be. I don't know if it's possible for you to exercise that kind of self-restraint in this modern age, but you must. Of all the things I could ask of you, this seems so small and simple. Can you do this for me?<br/></blockquote><br/>(I did resist, but it was actually hard to.)<br/><br/>        I usually don't rate merely formal experiment, intentional awkwardness. But the warmth of his great first book and the constant self-deprecation and plaintive concrete detail make it easy.<br/><blockquote><br/>        ""What's your name?""<br/>        ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff#Real_identity"">I won't say</a>""<br/>        ""It's just a name, mate!

The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive.

Consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>    There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved. <br/></blockquote></i><br/>(That last sentence had ""by the Creator"" tacked on in the second edition.)<br/><br/>You would never guess the prose was written in a rush: possibly because the arguments were formed at the slowest possible rate.",,,1,0

My favourite bit is the paean to Alvin Roth's organ-swap algorithm, which is a magnificent way of circumventing human squeamishness.<br/><br/>Lots of direct quotation from the unprepossessing scientists doing all this, <3. There are also lots of addenda of the following sort:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    The story of Gerald Bull goes like this. You have a brilliant engineer who's especially good at ballistics at an early age, who had a brilliant career early on where he got funding from Canada and the US to work on these ballistics programs. Then basically the funding dried up. So he kind of did whatever it took to be able to keep working in this area, which led him to do work in weapons dealing, including dealing with then apartheid South Africa. And things basically unraveled from there, resulting in his humiliation and depression and alcoholism.<br/><br/>    Then much later in life he began working for Saddam Hussein, building, for reasons that are not well understood, a giant gun. To be clear, it was probably not useful as a weapon. It was not going to be moveable, it was not pointing at an enemy city: it was pointing as the Earth turns, which is what you'd want to do if you were shooting into space. Then, shortly after that, in the early ‘90s he ended up in a Brussels hotel with a bullet in his head and $20,000 on his body, and nobody is sure who killed him. I believe his son suspected Mossad, but no one as far as I can find has come forward to say here's who did it. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Suitable for all ages, knob jokes aside.

His films’ typical tone and message (Nietzschean tragicomedy) doesn't really appeal to me. I watch them – and I watch them all, even since <i><a href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dinotasia/#contentReviews"">Dinotasia</a></i> – for their literal and figurative voice: his relentless, Teutonic ecstatic absurdity.

His sincere interest in the locals’ territorial plight, his physical participation in the set construction and management, his absorption in the suffering of jungle animals, his incongruous bright-eyed interest in mathematics, his astonishing codependency with Kinski, are all deeply disarming. The prose takes some getting used to, since the plain unflinching goth awe of it is the kind of thing we are primed to mock. <br/><blockquote><i>The jungle is obscene. Everything about it is sinful, for which reason the sin does not stand out as sin. The voices in the jungle are silent; nothing is stirring, and a languid, immobile anger hovers over everything.</blockquote></i><br/>It is worth acclimating to: each entry is both bleak and hilarious, and Krishna Winston's translation is a thing of wonder, no doubt improving on WH. <br/><blockquote><i>I recall experiencing a similar shiver of awe as a child in Sachrang, when I found a fried piece of bright blue plastic that had floated down the brook and got caught on an over hanging branch. At the time, I had never seen anything like it, and I kept it hidden for weeks, licked it, found it slightly stretchy, full of miraculous properties. Not until weeks later, when I had my fill of owning it, did I show it to anyone. Till and I discovered when you held a burning match to it, it melted; it gave black smoke and a nasty smell, but it was something we had never seen before, an emissary from a distant world high in the mountains, along the upper reaches of the brook, where it vanished into gorges and there were no people. So where did it come from? Had it blown into the mountains by the wind? Idid not know, but I gave the plastic a name-what I do not recall. I do know it had a nice sound, and was very secret, and since then I have often racked my brains, trying to remember that name, that word. I would give a lot to know it, but I do not, and I also do not have that delicate piece of weather-beaten plastic anymore. Having neither the secret word nor the plastic makes me poorer today than I was as a child.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>He certainly views the natural world right: as overwhelmingly a place of horrifying and pointless suffering, cooed over by pseuds from cars. <br/><blockquote><i>Sweat, storm clouds overhead, sleeping dogs. There is a smell of stale urine. In my soup, ants and bugs were swimming among the globules of fat. Lord Almighty, send us an earthquake.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>There’s not a lot of technical info here, or explanations of the crew’s role or background; there's no timeline or context added; nor even very much about the film at all.

(After Peckinpah). How can anyone write anything new about poor white psychopaths in the hot rural places of Victorian America? The answer turns out simple: just have prose so tight and freshening - a jet hose comprising one-third Bible, one-third Emerson, one-third Ballard - that you again uncover the  elemental bones of the Western. Also savagely de-emphasise your characters. Place them in enormous, indifferent vistas; give us no inner monologue - nor even indirect report of subjective life; have no speech marks to set their words apart from the landscapes (do not draw the eye to their presumed humanity); have no apostrophes, no hyphens even, lest we remember; have as few names as possible, leave them as types - ""kid"" or ""captain"" or ""mexican"" or ""brave""; set their incredible violence among such vast places it looks like little; have few capital letters but for God's.<br/><br/>Lock your readers out; make everyone and everything opaque. As he says himself:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    In the neuter austerity of that terrain all phenomena were bequeathed a strange equality and no one thing nor spider nor stone nor blade of grass could put forth claim to precedence.</i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>These cowboys and injuns punctuate the beautiful land of Central America with hanged babies; rings of decapitate heads; a four-eyed dog; a man calmly eating his own shit; endless thirsty hallucinogenic despair. This is exhausting, quite hard to read:<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>    All night the wind blew and the fine dust set their teeth on edge. Sand in everything, grit in all they ate. In the morning a urinecolored sun rose blearily through panes of dust on a dim world and without feature. The animals were failing... That night they rode through a region electric and wild where strange shapes of soft blue fire ran over the metal of the horses' trappings and the wagonwheels rolled in hoops of fire and little shapes of pale blue light came to perch in the ears of the horses and in the beards of the men... the mountains on the sudden skyline stark and black and livid like a land of some other order out there whose true geology was not stone but fear.</i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(As well as this Nabokovian trudge through the middle section, McCarthy sometimes steers close to the comical with sentences like '<i>Itinerant degenerates bleeding west like a heliotropic plague.</i>')<br/><br/>A typical human interaction in this book is ""The kid looked at the man""; no more. There's plenty of grandeur - just not in humans. <br/><br/>At the centre stands the Judge: Satan, Ahab and Moby Dick all in one. (""<i>His skin is so pale as to have almost no pigment</i>."") Racism, fear and poverty form the baseline. The Comanches, for instance, are here worse than demons <br/><blockquote><i><br/>    ...grotesque with daubings like a company of mounted clowns... riding down upon them like a horde from a hell more horrible yet than the brimstone land of Christian reckoning...</i><br/></blockquote>- ""at least demons are Christian""!<br/><br/>Lots of descriptions of the stars, inbetween brutalities<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    The night sky lies so sprent with stars that there is scarcely a space of black at all and they fall all night in bitter arcs and it is so that their numbers are no less...<br><br><br/>    The stars burned with a lidless fixity and they drew nearer in the night until toward dawn he was stumbling among the whinstones of the uttermost ridge to heaven.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>For the first time I understand why Aristotle's physics divides the world into different celestial and terranean operations: from down here back then, the stars look so clean and permanent, they're just not of our world, dirty, unhinged, and endangered as it has been, for almost everyone.<br/><br/><li><br/><i><a href=""https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/"">Galef type</a></i>: <br/><b>Data 2</b> - What does it imply about the world, that X could happen?, & <br/><b>Style 3</b> - tickle your aesthetic sense in a way that obliquely makes you a more interesting, generative thinker.</li>",,,1,0

That’s why kids can survive...<br/>There is a cabal operating in fast food restaurants who want to take over the world by drugging the most popular fast food with powerful magical drugs.<br/>The internet is one big engine. The faster the information flows, the more power it generates. If anyone could find out how to harness this power they could rule the world.<br/>Brendan Behan’s pint glass sits behind the bar in a Dublin pub. Any who drink from it have words flow from them, but at what price?<br/>Nearly every nursery rhyme originated as teaching tools for magicians.

But I know better. People despise critics because people despise weakness, and criticism is the weakest thing you can do in writing. It is the written equivalent of air guitar—flurries of silent, sympathetic gestures with nothing at their heart but the memory of the music. It produces no knowledge, states no facts, and never stands alone. It neither saves the things we love (as we would wish them saved) nor ruins the things we hate. Edinburgh Review could not destroy John Keats, nor Diderot Boucher, nor Ruskin Whistler; and I like that about it. It’s a loser’s game, and everybody knows it.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Some of the most pleasurable prose I've ever read. It's so good, I worry I'm being convinced of things I shouldn't be. Like, say, Chesterton he is besotted with paradoxes and the contrary. Like Chesterton he is more than good enough to outweigh his questionable opinions.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>it has always seemed to me that Rockwell and [Johnny] Mercer must certainly be important artists, not so much because people love them (although that is a part of it) but because I had learned so much from them—and because they both denied it so strenuously. Still, for a long time, I really didn’t know what kind of art they made, or what it did. I only knew that it wasn’t high art, which is defined by its context and its exclusivity—and is always, in some sense, about that context and that exclusivity.<br/><br/>I decided that, if high art is always about context and exclusivity, the art of Rockwell and Mercer, which denies both with a vengeance, must be about that denial. To put it simply: Norman Rockwell’s painting, like Johnny Mercer’s music, has no special venue. It lives in the quotidian world with us amidst a million other things, so it must define itself as we experience it, embody itself and be remembered to survive. So it must rhyme, must live in pattern, which is the mother of remembering. Moreover, since this kind of art lacks any institutional guarantee of our attention, it must be selected by us—and since it aspires to be selected by all of us, it must accept and forgive us too—and speak the language of acceptance and forgiveness. And since it can only flourish in an atmosphere of generosity and agreement, it must somehow, in some way, promote that atmosphere.<br/><br/>Thus, there is in Rockwell (as there is in Dickens) this luminous devotion to the possibility of domestic kindness and social accord—along with an effortless proclivity to translate any minor discord into comedy and forgiving tristesse—and this domain of kindness and comedy and tristesse is not the truth, but it is a part of it, and a part that we routinely deny these days, lest we compromise our social agendas...<br/><br/>This is what he celebrates and insists upon: that “normal” life, in this country, is not normal at all—that we all exist in a general state of social and physical equanimity that is unparalleled in the history of humans. (Why else would we alert the media every time we feel a little bit blue?)<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>This book turned my head around. Here a lifelong art critic and practitioner disparages high art and its comparatively shallow theorists; glorifies Vegas, Liberace, and Norman Rockwell, and cries out for a little honest vulgarity, a little fun. He says confusing things about social identity which I still haven't quite unpicked. Here he tells us that his profession is pathetic, beneath us. Writing was not atop the world, and so the profession wasn't, and so...<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>I see the object. I translate that seeing into vision. I encode that vision into language, and append whatever speculations and special pleadings I deem appropriate to the occasion. At this point, whatever I have written departs. It enters the historical past, perpetually absent from the present, and only represented there in type—while the visible artifact remains in the present moment—positively there, visually available for the length of its existence regardless of its antiquity—perpetually re-created by the novelty of its experiential context. As a consequence, what I write and what I have written about diverge from the moment of their confluence and never meet again.<br/><br/>The writing gets older with each passing moment while the artifact gets newer. There are works of art on the wall of my apartment, for instance, that I have written about in the past. They remain as fresh and devious today as the first day I set eyes upon them, invariably evoking the sense memory of that first bright encounter—while the words I wrote on that occasion, informed by that brightness, have yellowed into antiquity and seem to me now as weathered and grotesque as Dorian’s portrait. Thus, in the same sense that there is only historical writing, there is no historical art beyond those imaginary works that critics describe in writing.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>From high in the airy galleries of California I am shown earthiness, gratitude, poptimism, concreteness, and puncturing pretense. All in a format lacking in them or unsuited to them. He told me to get out of my head, and somehow I listened.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>Thanks to Waylon {Jennings], as well, and to Willie Nelson, Bobby Bare, and Hank Williams, Jr. for their insights into the life and art of Hank Williams; and thank you to Isaiah Berlin, Jane Jacobs, Jacqueline Lichtenstein, Nathalie Sarraute, and Leo Steinberg<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>How is this book not known for what it is? How can an <i>academic</i> write like this?<br/>",,,2,0

It succeeds at several rare things: depicting a scientist protagonist actually thinking in extremis; depicting an alien ecosystem, a thing with its own thing going on, misaligned with us but not hateful or a mere inversion of human value; relatedly, noticing the great horror story that is an ordinary ecosystem; depicting the common, vital, neglected fact that being <i>really</i> interested in something can systematically outweigh your fear, insecurity, hatred, love.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>I could easily lose hours there, observing the hidden life of tidal pools, and sometimes I marveled at the fact that I had been given such a gift: not just to lose myself in the present moment so utterly but also to have such solitude, which was all I had ever craved during my studies, my practice to reach this point.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>The prose is refined, sometimes faintly echoing Cormac McCarthy:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>This water was so dark we could see our faces in it, and it never stirred, set like glass, reflecting the beards of gray moss that smothered the cypress trees. If you looked out through these areas, toward the ocean, all you saw was the black water, the gray of the cypress trunks, and the constant, motionless rain of moss flowing down. All you heard was the low moaning. The effect of this cannot be understood without being there. The beauty of it cannot be understood, either, and when you see beauty in desolation it changes something inside you. Desolation tries to colonize you.” <br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>The creatures / mind of Area X are scary, but not in a jump scare or serial killer way. They're just different. There's horror in nature, and the best PR team ever (Wordsworth, Muir, Attenborough) can't fully disguise this from you. Vast endless <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichneumonidae#Reproduction_and_diet"">torture</a> is part of its horror, but the rest is just difference and inevitability and scale. VanderMeer ties the spooky weirdness of Area X to the opacity and inhumanity of nature:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>the longer I stared at it, the less comprehensible the creature became. The more it became something alien to me, the more I had a sense that I knew nothing at all — about nature, about ecosystems. There was something about my mood and its dark glow that eclipsed sense, that made me see this creature, which had indeed been assigned a place in the taxonomy--catalogued, studied, and described--irreducible down to any of that. And if I kept looking, I knew that ultimately I would have to admit I knew less than nothing about myself as well, whether that was a lie or the truth.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>For a cosmic horror book, the biologist manages to avoid mysterianism amongst deep mysteries. VanderMeer keeps her thinking even in the face of her senses failing:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    I am aware that all of this speculation is incomplete, inexact, inaccurate, useless. If I don’t have real answers, it is because we still don’t know what questions to ask. Our instruments are useless, our methodology broken, our motivations selfish.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>You need to be comfortable with unresolved tension and inexplicable mythos and jarring shifts in tone and meaning. You need to be comfortable seeing the whole thing from a strange view, ""the biologist's"". People call her antisocial and autistic, but really she's just completely internally motivated: she cannot give a fuck, she will not make herself likeable, will not spill her guts for you. Like this book. <br/><br/>Maybe 4/5 if I keep thinking about it later.",,,1,0

So like those high school white girls who have after-school sex with the burly black athlete in the wood shop, and then cry rape when their fathers find out, maybe Rosa Parks, after the arrest, the endless church rallies, and all the press, had to cry racism, because what was she going to say: “I refused to move because the man asked me what I was reading”?

But that doesn't mean anything: Beatty is indiscriminate: mocking stereotyped black behaviour <i>and</i> police brutality, <i>and</i> pious diversity pushers, <i>and</i> white arrogance, <i>and</i> classic Civil Rights heroes, <i>and</i> radical black intellectuals, <i>and</i> assimilated Establishment black elites, <i>and</i> colorblind universalists. So, you <i>can</i> say ""it satirises [more or less every position you can take on] race in America"". But what's the point of doing that? <br><br><br/><br/>I can think of three: 1) to say that there is no sensible position on this seething topic; or 2) to say that we haven't found it yet and must move past the existing positions, or 3) to use the nasty symmetry between the racist and the active anti-racist, to reflect well on <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/"">Coatesian justice</a> - maybe the thought is: 'colorblind egalitarianism is such a mad idea that even naked nineteenth-century racism is superior to it'.) <br/><br/>I don't know which (if any) is Beatty's view. I know I don't agree. There's nothing actually wrong with <a href=""http://quillette.com/2018/02/14/dont-abandon-king-standard/"">MLK's principle</a>, <i>judge absolutely everyone on their own merits rather than treating them as a representative of their race or sex or anything</i>, though it has usually been poorly realised.<br/><br/>But I respect the chutzpah of pissing everyone off. If nothing else it's original and bullshit-free, two rare predicates around here.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/><i>I’m not sure what Unmitigated Blackness is, but whatever it is, it doesn’t sell.

Clarence Cooper, Charlie Parker, Richard Pryor, Maya Deren, Sun Ra, Mizoguchi, Frida Kahlo, black-and-white Godard, Céline, Gong Li, David Hammons, Björk, and the Wu-Tang Clan in any of their hooded permutations. Unmitigated Blackness is essays passing for fiction. It’s the realization that there are no absolutes, except when there are. It’s the acceptance of contradiction not being a sin and a crime but a human frailty like split ends and libertarianism. Unmitigated Blackness is the realization that as fucked up as it all is, sometimes it’s nihilism that makes life worth living.</i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or <br/><blockquote><i><br/>Daddy never believed in closure. He said it was a false psychological concept. Something invented by therapists to assuage white Western guilt. In all his years of study and practice, he’d never heard a patient of color talk of needing “closure.” They needed revenge. They needed distance. Forgiveness and a good lawyer maybe, but never closure. He said people mistake suicide, murder, lap band surgery, interracial marriage, and overtipping for closure, when in reality what they’ve achieved is erasure.<br/><br/>The problem with closure is that once you have a taste of it, you want it in every little aspect of your life. Especially when you’re bleeding to death, and your slave, who is in full rebellion, is screaming,... you attempt to stanch the bleeding with a waterlogged copy of <b>Vibe</b> magazine someone has left in the gutter.

Beatty <i>has no answer</i> and is again brave enough to say so; the book's last page admits no synthesis can win over that particular sceptic: Obama isn't enough, nothing is enough:<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>I remember the day after the black dude was inaugurated, Foy Cheshire, proud as punch, driving around town in his coupe, honking his horn and waving an American flag. He wasn’t the only one celebrating; the neighborhood glee wasn’t O. J. Simpson getting acquitted or the Lakers winning the 2002 championship, but it was close. Foy drove past the crib and I happened to be sitting in the front yard husking corn. “Why are you waving the flag?” I asked him. “Why now? I’ve never seen you wave it before.” He said that he felt like the country, the United States of America, had finally paid off its debts. “And what about the Native Americans? What about the Chinese, the Japanese, the Mexicans, the poor, the forests, the water, the air, the fucking California condor? When do they collect?” I asked him.<br/><br/>He just shook his head at me. Said something to the effect that my father would be ashamed of me and that I’d never understand. And he’s right. I never will.</i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The protagonist segregates, and says things like this:<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>I’m a farmer, and farmers are natural segregationists. We separate the wheat from the chaff. I’m not Rudolf Hess, P. W. Botha, Capitol Records, or present-day U.S. of A. Those motherfuckers segregate because they want to hold on to power. I’m a farmer: we segregate in an effort to give every tree, every plant, every poor Mexican, every poor nigger, a chance for equal access to sunlight and water; we make sure every living organism has room to breathe.</i><br/></blockquote><br><br/><br/>And yet he is not a separatist; he knows it's wrong when the minorities are shouted out of the public space:<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>What the fuck you honkies laughing at?” he shouted. More chuckling from the audience. The white couple howling the loudest. Slapping the table. Happy to be noticed. Happy to be accepted. “I ain’t bullshitting! What the fuck are you interloping motherfuckers laughing at? Get the fuck out!”<br><br/><br/>There’s nothing funny about nervous laughter. The forced way it slogs through a room with the stop-and-start undulations of bad jazz brunch jazz. The black folks and the round table of Latinas out for a night on the town knew when to stop laughing. The couple didn’t. The rest of us silently sipped our canned beer and sodas, determined to stay out of the fray. They were laughing solo because this had to be part of the show, right?<br/><br/>“Do I look like I’m fucking joking with you? This shit ain’t for you. Understand? Now get the fuck out! This is our thing!” <br/><br/>No more laughter. Only pleading, unanswered looks for assistance, then the soft scrape of two chairs being backed, quietly as possible, away from the table. The blast of cold December air and the sounds of the street. The night manager shutting the doors behind them, leaving little evidence that the white people had ever been there except for an unfulfilled two-drink, three-donut minimum.<br/><br/>When I think about that night, the black comedian chasing the white couple into the night, their tails and assumed histories between their legs, I don’t think about right or wrong. No, when my thoughts go back to that evening, I think about my own silence. Silence can be either protest or consent, but most times it’s fear. I guess that’s why I’m so quiet and such a good whisperer, nigger and otherwise. It’s because I’m always afraid. Afraid of what I might say. What promises and threats I might make and have to keep. That’s what I liked about the man, although I didn’t agree with him when he said, “Get out. This is our thing.” I respected that he didn’t give a fuck. But I wish I hadn’t been so scared, that I had had the nerve to stand in protest. Not to castigate him for what he did or to stick up for the aggrieved white people... but I wish I’d stood up to the man and asked him a question: “So what exactly is our thing?</i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>Which is my laughter, but not my flight. <i>The Sellout</i> doesn't have an ism: they are all found wanting. I'm just glad it is still possible to explore this godforsaken crater without being screamed down. I'm glad Beatty didn't let it get to him, even if he leaves the Sellout hanging.",,,1,0

But this book, about being young, poor, and dizzily romantic in 80s New York, is too thin, 90% style. I don't resent reading about him and his wife hanging around department stores, nor even the long passage praising his wife, but I also don't take away anything beyond the mouthfeel of his words.<br/><br/>In some sense their impractical romanticism - spending their last savings on one fancy suit, appreciating graffiti, lingering around Bloomingdale's not buying anything - was straightforwardly aspirational and material. Not bohemian, or, temporarily, on the way up, merely waiting to become an aesthete and, glory of glories, a tastemaker. This is the great tension of arty people, particularly if (as the Gopniks do not) you have pretensions to moral superiority: really you are rejecting one consumerism for another. Book people get away with this most, because the sensuality and pleasure of great writing is hidden between the covers. One solution is to get into high-status trash (you can't be accused of narrow sensualism for liking Tracey Emin or Billy Childish); far more common is to contort yourself so that liking and buying art <i>is</i> a moral action, if not a cleaner and more beautifully non-instrumental kind of moral action than merely doing something for someone.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>It’s human nature to turn a mouth taste into a moral taste—to make a question of how something feels in your mouth into a question of what it says about your world. That’s the basis of every dietary law. When we imagine God, we don’t imagine him indifferent to appetite. No, we imagine him enraged and enraptured by what we’re eating—he tastes bacon and declares it bad and tastes matzo and can hear a whole heroic history when he breaks it. Every mouth taste instantly becomes a moral taste. And so when we need to fight—and no marriage can survive without some useful friction—we fight about food...<br/><br/>The restaurants of New York enraptured me—we didn’t go to any, but I loved the idea of them. I would lie in bed, after we unrolled and enwrapped the “triple fold” sofa every night, and read what was then the premier guide to New York dining out, Seymour Britchky’s <i>The Restaurants of New York</i>... It’s a vanished tone now, in the age of mass amateur reviews on Open Spoon or Table Talk or whatever the current forum is called. (“I took my honey here for birthday dinner, and—wow!—what a blowout. Five stars, for sure.”)<br/><br/>At the time, though, his criticism... seemed thrilling in the power of its sneering, the certitude of its exclusions. The power critic of this kind depends on the lightning turns of his contempt and his favour: no one should ever be sure where he would land, or on whom.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Note the smooth way in which a cool irreverent idea - ""<i>It’s human nature to turn a mouth taste into a moral taste</i>"" - becomes a certain precept ""<i>Every mouth taste instantly becomes a moral taste</i>"" just by lightness and repetition. This is the downside of being this good at prose: you can make things sound simpler than they are.<br/><br/>The humour is ever-present but vanishingly slight. When he loses his only pair of suit trousers, he devotes five pages to a comic lament for them. But it's the echo of comedy.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>I've never recovered them. Because the truth is that what we learn in New York is that a piece of plywood will never protect you from the wild, and that and that suit trousers, once lost, are lost forever. The city makes you the opposite of the emperor with the new clothes. He walked around unclothed, and everyone noticed but him. In New York, you walk around naked from the waist down for decades, and nobody knows but you.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>There are still three or four wonderful points, the best of the <i>New Yorker</i>'s shallow profundity<br/><blockquote><i><br/>The idea of the cash machine, which now seems either self-evident or dated, seemed exciting then. Cautiously withdrawing thirty-five dollars at a time from our tiny fund, and doing it first at the Chase machine on Third Avenue but soon at cash machines all over town... we came into a different daily relation to money than our parents had done. My grandparents had belonged to a check-cashing generation, proud to be engaged in it. To have an institution as large as an American bank in effect endorse their signature on a little bit of paper as equivalent to money meant to be taken seriously as a citizen. My parents, in turn, were credit card cultists – they loved having them, signing them, showing them, using them. For those who came of age in the boom times after the Second World War, the whole notion of credit, of sharing in a limitless improving future – of being trusted to buy now and pay later, since later would be so much richer than now – had some of the same significance that the notion of being trusted with checks had for my grandparents.<br/><br/>We, in turn, generationally, had regressed, I realized back into a cash economy – we used checks just to pay the utilities. The machines were one more instrument of that infantilization; we went to the machines for something that felt, at least, like our allowance.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>",,,1,0

He put the cloth in a little pouch, sat down beside him. ""But look; this table's clean.'<br/>         He agreed that the table was clean.<br/>         ""Usually,' the man said. ""I work on alien -- no offence -- alien religions; Directional Emphasis In Religious Observance; that's my specialty ... like when temples or graves or prayers always have to face in a certain direction; that sort of thing?

What is any achievement, however great it was, once time itself is dead? Of course, if all I did was wipe tables, then of course it would seem a mean and despicable waste of my huge intellectual potential. But because I choose to do it, it gives me pleasure.

(And reminded himself that the stars too would explode, perhaps, one day.) “Most people are not prepared to have their minds changed,” he said. “And I think they know in their hearts that other people are just the same, and one of the reasons people become angry when they argue is that they realize just that, as they trot out their excuses.”<br/>         “Excuses, eh?""<br/>         ""Yes, excuses,"" he said, with what Erens thought might just have been a trace of bitterness. ""I strongly suspect the things people believe in are usually just what they instinctively feel is right; the excuses, the justifications, the things you're supposed to argue about, come later. They're the least important part of the belief. That's why you can destroy them, win an argument, prove the other person wrong, and still they believe what they did in the first place."" He looked at Erens. ""You've attacked the wrong thing.” <br/></blockquote></i><br/>But this was also before I got into technical pursuits which lend us hope that the above grim realism can be defeated by self-awareness, quantification, and epistemic care.

(Anachronistically witty, sceptical?) Mantel manages to make all the tiresome court manoeuvring interesting just by having it pass through Cromwell, her sensitive, competent monster.<br/><br/>Halfway through, Cromwell turns from rational underdog to corrupt totalitarian. Or, halfway through you realise that this turn has happened, that this aspect was there. He kills his enemies based on hearsay and jokes, zero physical and eyewitness evidence. Mantel manages this fall in a smooth and inevitable way. I complain about current legal systems a lot, but at least their errors are not this unjust and merely political.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>When Gregory says, 'Are they guilty?' he means, 'Did they do it?' But when [Thomas] says, 'Are they guilty?' he means, 'Did the court find them so?' The lawyer's world is entire unto itself, the human pared away. It was a triumph, in a small way, to unknot the entanglement of thighs and tongues, to take that mass of heaving flesh and smooth it on to white paper: as the body, after the climax, lies back on white linen. He has seen beautiful indictments, not a word wasted.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/><blockquote><i>“Nothing makes you falter,” Wyatt says. He says it with a reluctant admiration that is close to dread. But he, Cromwell, thinks, I did falter but no one knows it, reports have not gone abroad. Wyatt did not see me walk away from Weston’s interrogation. Wyatt did not see me when Anne asked me what I believed in my heart.<br/><br/>He rests his eyes on the prisoner, he takes his seat. He says softly, “I think I have been training all my years for this. I have served an apprenticeship to myself.” His whole career has been an education in hypocrisy. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/><br/>Lots of artistic licence, to patch over the huge gaps in the historical record (as Mantel admits in the postscript). Cromwell is sympathetic here, even with all the blood and lies - you notice his evil only after effort.

But somehow this was both boring and evil, both childish and didactic. I won't belabour the book's immorality, since it is so obvious; it's the near-total absence of artistic merit that is apparently not obvious. I found nothing in it worth reading or quoting until Book 9, nearly half way through. Songs of praise of warmongering pirates. (People love pirates, and I say let em. Just don't call them paragons.) <br/><br/>The ideology is dad porn, a set of thin, obvious, animal values. ""Kings do whatever they want - death for messing with a noble; don't cross the priests; offer huge sacrifices; always do what your husband and dad say; the unlucky and the disabled are cursed and to be shunned; blood is blood is blood."" <br/><blockquote><i>    The ghost<br/>    of Agamemnon answered, “Lucky you,<br/>    cunning Odysseus: you got yourself<br/>    a wife of virtue—great Penelope.<br/>    How principled she was, that she remembered<br/>    her husband all those years! Her fame will live<br/>    forever, and the deathless gods will make<br/>    a poem to delight all those on earth<br/>    about intelligent Penelope.<br/></blockquote></i>(Odysseus sleeps with half a dozen other women and demigods, most of them begging him to, and needless to say suffers nothing of it.)<br/><br/>There's no mention of the suffering of the several cities he sacks, or the many tacitly raped women. Dozens of people are murdered for being rude, though. For a quasi-sacred text there's a surprising amount of unpunished priest killing (e.g. Leodes).<br/><br/>The structure is awful: we see almost nothing of Odysseus for the first quarter of the poem, instead following his son around as he listens to a series of boring old men. Most of Odysseus' feats are not shown, are instead related by him as unaffecting stories. (I suppose we could amuse ourselves by treating this as unreliable narration, but they certainly didn't.) And the poem doesn't end at its climax, instead meandering on through another few books of pointless back-patting.<br/><br/>(Should I go easy? After all, this is groundbreaking work, the <i>prototype</i> of art. Sure; I'll go easy if you stop hyping it and making everyone read it as an exemplar.)<br/>(It's not that they could easily have been otherwise. Too poor, too lawless, too near to nature.)<br/><br/>It must be a cliche among classicists that the 'Classical' civilisations were not <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/classical"">classical</a> in the sense of being austere, logical, tasteful, or contemplative. That they were not Apollonian, that only a handful of people in them were. I hope my rant here is not just me being misled by the modern sense of ""hero"" - but the fact is that Odysseus wins, is praised endlessly, and his rights trump all else.<br/><br/>This isn't just me being clueless, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orality"">post-oral</a>, and close-minded: The ancients were well aware that the ending is unsatisfying crap. One popular headcanon was that, after Odysseus slays the suitors, he is immediately exiled from Ithaca, set adrift again. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPrd8FoClAA"">Cue the music!</a><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>One reading of Odysseus' name is as variant of the verb '<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus#Name,_etymology,_and_epithets"">to be hated</a>'. So a calque might be ""King Punchable of Ithaca"". (""the most unhappy man alive"")<br/><br/>Odysseus is treated incredibly well by almost everyone, despite his crimes. Complete strangers oil him up and dress him in fine ""woolen cloak and tunic"" <i>eleven times</i>, and he is given precious weaponry and potions for nothing several times. This is supposed to reflect on him, but instead it shows the Greek ideal of hospitality, one of the few nice things in that culture.<br/><br/>He appears to sincerely miss Ithaca (his status more than his wife), weeping frequently. But he also fucks about all the time, for instance staying an entire year voluntarily enjoying Circe.<br/><br/>It is completely unclear what O does to deserve his fortune. (Whereas his misfortune is always directly linked to his own machismo or idiocy.) The only virtues we see him exercise directly (not counting brute aggression and discus throwing) are courage and cunning (specifically lying). Ok, he also makes one good speech:<br/><blockquote><i>'Listen to me, my friends, despite your grief.<br/>We do not know where darkness lives, nor dawn,<br/>nor where the sun that shines upon the world<br/>goes underneath the earth, nor where it rises.<br/>We need a way to fix our current plight,<br/>but I do not know how...</blockquote></i><br/>I suppose we can put the rest down to charisma, the oddest and least rational of human powers.<br/><blockquote><i>'It seems that everybody loves this man,<br/>and honors him, in every place we sail to.'</blockquote></i><br/>Everyone extols him without him ever demonstrating the virtues they extol. (Politeness, propriety, wisdom, strategy...) Every other idiot is ""godlike"" at something or other, and seeing the state of their gods you see how this could be true. At least it's funny:<br/><blockquote><i>He went out of his bedroom like a god</blockquote></i><blockquote><i>King Menelaus, you are right... Your voice is like a god's to us.</blockquote></i><blockquote><i>Majestic, holy King Alcinous<br/>leapt out of bed, as did Odysseus<br/>the city-sacker. Then the blessed king,<br/>mighty Alcinous, led out his guest...</blockquote></i><br/>(The gods are stupid mirrors of Greek nobility; for instance they have supernatural slaves, the nymphs.) This at least is a philosophical difference between them and I: in their superstitious idealist mode, properties aren't for describing the present, but instead the timeless essence of a thing:<br/><blockquote><i>Ships are ""black"", ""hollow"", ""swift"" or ""curved"", never ""brown"", ""slow"" or ""wobbly""... Penelope is ""prudent Penelope"", never ""swift-footed Penelope"", even if she is moving quickly. Telemachus is thoughtful, even when he seems particularly immature.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>All the feats of the heroes are totally dependent on the power of gods. If they say you can't sail, you can't. <blockquote><i>His skin <br/>would have been ripped away, and his bones smashed<br/>had not Athena given him a thought.</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>Athena poured unearthly charm<br/>upon his head and shoulders, and she made him<br/>taller and sturdier, so these Phaecians<br/>would welcome and respect him.</blockquote></i><br/>Without Hermes or Athena constantly intervening, O would be nowhere, achieve nothing. One nice tension here though:<br/><blockquote><i>But death is universal. Even gods<br/>cannot protect the people that they love,<br/>when fate and cruel death catch up with them.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>One of the few times I felt sympathy for Odysseus was when he was trying to lead his men, who are mainly large-adult-sons. (Same with the suitors.) One breaks his neck falling down a ladder. They undo a month of work by playing with the bag of winds. Several times they are totally paralysed by their wailing and tantrums. <br/><blockquote><i>As when <br/>a herd of cows is coming back from pasture<br/>into the yard; and all the little heifers<br/>jump from their pens to skip and run towards<br/>their mothers, and they cluster round them, mooing;<br/>just so my men, as soon they saw me, <br/>began to weep...</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>The other men... <br/>wept for those that died. I ordered them<br/>to stop their crying, scowling hard at each.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Odysseus occasionally draws his sword on them for backtalking him, or running around like Muppets. Their deaths are roughly equally due to Odysseus' aggression and avarice, and their own foolishness.<br/><br/>I cheered the uprising against him, who are completely in the right. But of course they lose, because of mere divine intervention.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>OK I lied: I will talk about evil. Though by the end of this I was jaded and dismissive, the aftermath of Odysseus slaughtering the suitors still struck me as an atrocity unusual for the genre:<br/><blockquote><i>""When the whole house is set in proper order,<br/>restore my halls to health: take out the [slave] girls<br/>between the courtyard wall and the rotunda.<br/>Hack at them with long swords, eradicate<br/>all life from them. They will forget the things<br/><b>the suitors made them do</b> with them in secret,<br/>through Aphrodite...""<br/><br/>""I refuse to grant these girls<br/>a clean death, since they poured down shame on me<br/>and Mother, when they lay beside the suitors.""<br/><br/>At that, he would a piece of sailor's rope<br/>round the rotunda...<br/>just so the girls, their heads all in a row,<br/>were strung up with the noose around their necks<br/>to make their death an agony. They gasped,<br/>feet twitching for a while, but not for long.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>I've read de Sade, Kaczynski, Himmler, Houellebecq, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moral_Virologist"">Egan</a> and <a href=""https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm"">Watts</a> at their most dyspeptic; it's not that I'm squeamish about real or fictional evil, or that my sulking sense of justice blinds me to aesthetics. This sort of thing happened; nothing cannot be said; maybe even nothing cannot be said beautifully. It's just that, again, there is nearly no nobility and no classicism in this. I am so glad this culture is gone.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Did its audience know the story was bullshit? Or was it scripture to them?

Well, <a href=""https://www.franksmitha.com/history/homer.htm"">they don't seem</a> to have had scripture, not even Hesiod. So Homer is more like Dante or Milton for them: not sacred, but pious and moralising.<br/><br/>How big was mighty Troy? How noble was godlike Odysseus? How petty their pantheon?

It's 100 pages of minor mental breakdowns, ten thousand hours of mind-numbing gruntwork, stupid status games, and disillusionment - all in plain, businesslike, affectless prose. Also, there's very little technical detail in it. You'd think he was describing painting a house, rather than a painful initiation into the partially-insane system of <i>placing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"">logic incarnate</a> in harness</i> (a system with surprisingly weak links to discovery and progress).<br/><blockquote><i>research was my only job, and I wouldn’t be able to earn a degree unless I succeeded at it.

The top CS schools don't let you graduate until you get 4 papers in ""top"" conferences: layers upon layers of luck and gatekeeping, only modestly correlated with your efforts. Oh, and you are unlikely to have much choice of project either. A recipe for misery. This is at the very top of the game, too: Stanford with full funding and annual internships at the big lads. It is both reassuring and horrifying to hear that elite groups waste months and submit total shit sometimes.<br/><i><blockquote>In the end, it took three attempts by four Ph.D. students over the course of five years before Dawson’s initial Klee-UC idea turned into a published paper.

He just analyses the narrow, nonscientific incentives of those around him and gets on with winning the game. He talks like this: ""<i>i think that leveraging [software] and aligning with both of your interests and incentives will be the best way for me to both make a contribution and also to feel satisfied about making concrete forward progress every day.</i>”. He uses 'top-tier' without scare quotes. At one point he dispassionately notes that half a dozen of his papers were rejected because he wasn't fluent in the specific sub-field's “rhetorical tricks, newfangled buzzwords, and marketing-related contortions required to satisfy reviewers"". That is, he comes up against bullshit Bourdieuan micro-distinctions, boundary work, irrelevant to science, and shrugs and sets about learning how to pass as an insider.

(Two obvious caveats: Not every Ph.D. student received these benefits—many grew jaded and burned-out from their struggles. Also, lots of people cultivate these positive traits without going through a Ph.D. program.)... <br/>Pursuing a Ph.D. has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life, and I feel extremely lucky to have been given the opportunity to be creative during this time.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>There is this to be said for the American seven year ditch: Guo was able to suffer and wander for three entire years before he had his first big idea. That's the other side: the incredible privilege of being paid to read, paid to talk to clever people, paid to think new thoughts. But who says privileges have to feel nice, or not drive you half-mad?<br/><br/>A very valuable warning for some tiny fraction of the world, a flat curio for some other tiny voyeur fraction.",,,1,0

Really nice. Dozens of original details. I liked the recycling replicator, feeding a stray your fingers, the Arabic-Hausa neologisms, procedural cartoons, dying face unlock. I flinched for the CIPA characters even though it means nothing to them.<br/><br/><i>The Song</i>, Erinn Kemper. Plenty of tension and ambiguity, unlike the other stories. Say you work on a machine that kills the creatures you love, because that's how you get to study them alive. Characters with more than one value, making terrible decisions, not solving problems, not quipping, not punching up. The setup relies on you thinking there's a difference in kind between killing a whale and killing a cow, which I don't. There's even a dig at monomaniacal Greens: ""<i>the carbon footprint resulting from eating whale meat is substantially lower than that of beef</i>(...)"" Works.<br/><br/>“Blue Morphos in the Garden” by Lis Mitchell. Playful sort of death, natural afterlife. I am glad the protagonist pushes back against the ancestor-worship and collective subsumption. <br/><blockquote><i>""Don't you think it’s selfish not to leave something that Lily can see, that she can tell her children about?”<br/>“Don’t you think it’s a bit much to expect me to define my entire life by my motherhood and the expectation that my daughter will want me around forever?""<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/><br/>“Water: A History” by KJ Kabza. romance vs economics. Still touched by the blind contrarian spirit of this volume, but at least it's well done.<br/><br/>“Skinner Box” by Carole Johnstone. Trapped in a tiny spaceship with your lover and your rapist. Angsty astronauts, too horny and sadistic to live. You can't send people this fucked up into space. But we will. Narrator is called a genius but shows no signs of it. Johnstone manages to make deep learning nasty, just by associating it with these mean narrow bastards. Nice mention of Graphcore, my local overweening tech giant.<br/><blockquote><i>""I don’t like the unpredictability of people. Of neocortexes. But I hate the predictability of nanites. The incorruptibility.""<br><br/>""Bots are just automated programs. They mostly replicate what we can already do, so we don’t have to do it. Conventional bots are ones and zeros. Nanites are built from DNA.” - but substrate is irrelevant to program.</blockquote></i><br/>Cruel, vague, but has a few ideas at least.<br/><br/><br/>""One/Zero"". Warzone children scene manipulative, saccharine. At least she's thinking big, Santa Superintelligence / Surveill. Boy and god. AI unbixes itself and everything goes swell. Attempt at lyrical Uplift mandala but ends up clumsy and soppy-stern.<br/>could their imagined trajectories be any worse than our increasing totalitarianism? Or any worse than one of the main hallmarks of what it means to be human, which is to kill our fellows, or even send our own kin to torture or death if a certain “belief”—whatever a belief might be, neurochemically speaking—has taken up residence in our unfathomable brains?<br/>Bring it on, I say. The change might be for the better.<br/><br/>“Seonag and the Seawolves” by M. Evan MacGriogair. Nice Celtic colour and rhythm, though actually it gets in the way of the images. The Gaelic is mostly not translated, and I didn't bother to google it. Portentous as usual, far too many one-sentence paragraphs, but it does islander prejudice and peaty magic well.<br/><br/>""Old Media"" by Annalee Newitz. Central conceit - that we would have economically-profitable human slavery at the same time as human-level AI - is full-on nonsense, but I actually didn't mind much. Goofy picture of a future humanities degree, studying harem anime and anti-robotism with your ace robot gf. <blockquote><i>She [robot gf] looked so beautiful that John thought his heart would crack open like the space eggs in a kaiju movie, full of lava and lightning and life forms that had never walked the Earth. </blockquote></i><br/><br/>“More Real Than Him” by Silvia Park. Protagonist is a basic K-pop stan and a sexist haxxor snob. (Hard to imagine such being technically talented, but some surely are.) Fun.<br/><br/><br/>“The Hundredth House Had No Walls” by Laurie Penny. Extremely conventional subversion of fairy tales, the princess saves herself in this one eh. Flat and clear and fine.<br/><br/>""Beyond the El"" by John Chu. Maudlin food magic. Few outright errors, as well as an apparently intentional hypernegation tic (""aren't not exactly rich"", ""the wind was not freezing""). Sister character is a boring 2D sociopath.<br/><br/>“As the Last I May Know” by S. L. Huang. Nuclear Omelas. Contains a dreadful slander on Otto Hahn, naming the warmonger nuke-happy president after him. Dreadful haiku. I'd have liked some details on how exactly they kept their nuclear secrets for 200 years; we didn't manage two. The story hinges on a false dichotomy, that the superweapon will necessarily kill children. Unless it's a very dense population, or the enemy are using hostages, then she doesn't explain why there's no tactical use.<br/><br/>“Deriving Life” by Elizabeth Bear. Incredibly glib, replacing the rightful defamiliarisation and mirror-darkly of SF with applause lights (""<i>Can you imagine a planet full of assholes who used to just . . . cut down trees?</i>"") Premise is bizarre and cool and she doesn't pull it off.<br/><br/>“Articulated Restraint” by Mary Robinette Kowal. <i>Really</i> irritating. Why do people glorify going to space when you're physically messed up? I guess this would be less pointless if you liked the character from elsewhere. I guess the actual Apollo equipment protocol details are nice.<br/><br/><br/>Would be one star without the Egan, Larson, Tidbeck, Kemper 3-stars.",,,1,0

He uses himself and Carl Jung as exemplars of the method - ""I published 4 books in 10 years"" and so on - but why should I judge either of them to have made a positive impact, merely because they published a lot? <br/><br/>Lots of cherry-picked anecdotes in the normal bad self-help mode, with no attention to <a href=""https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/"">survivorship bias</a>. <i>Deep Work</i> has the same feel as the disgraced <a href=""https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/""><i>Why We Sleep</i></a>: empirically sloppy exaggeration of a plausibly ultra-important topic. Unlike Walker, Newport is not explicitly claiming scientific authority though.<br/><br/>The topic is networked technology as a force against individual productivity. There's a weak and a strong form:<br/><br/><ul><br/><li><i>Weak</i>: ""You need to focus to do great work, or to learn new hard things. And work on the Internet is extremely vulnerable to distraction and tends to be less focussed.""</li><br><br/><br/><li><i>Strong</i>: ""The always-on fragmentary state of being caused by addictive technology is <i>disabling</i>. It has lasting developmental effects, reducing your attention span, serenity, perspective."" (Lanier, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/11/shallows-internet-changing-way-think"">Carr</a>.)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/>Newport makes both claims (""<i>Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work.</i>""), and the strong one is poorly justified to say the least. But the weak form is plausible and important enough on its own.<br/><br/>I wondered how much this was just a rehash of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)"">Flow</a> idea, and in fact Newport does give it its due. It seems fair to update the idea after 40 great years of tech and the culture of tech. (I had no mobile phone until I was 17, no smartphone until I was 27. My abstinence would be much harder now.)<br/><br/>The weak evidence could be forgiven if the claims were weaker, or if the tone was less pompous. Plus two stars for being about an important possibility, minus one for being unrigorous, minus one for tone.<br/><br/>Things I try to do:<br/><br/>* Track your amount of deep work hours every day.<br><br/>* Protect your morning: get out of bed quickly and don't browse.<br><br/>* Do ""time blocking"", earmarking a whole day for focused work<br><br/>* Batch shallow work (emails, meetings) in one time slots, probably the evening.<br/>* Leave your phone in a different room. <br/><br/>He talks about scheduling your entire day, which I suspect is perverse.

This subculture hid inside the superhuman apolitical dreamland, mathematics.* It could only exist because of the sacrifices of famous and decent men, <a href=""https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3376"">Kolmogorov</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Danilovich_Aleksandrov"">Aleksandrov</a>. Their selective maths schools seem to have been the only nice places to be in the entire <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Empire"">empire</a>, for any intellectual with a taste for actual discourse, or for the truth.<br/><br/>(Reasons it can't be so much a biography: the subject refused to talk to her, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman#Possible_withdrawal_from_mathematics"">does things</a> that are very hard to explain, and doesn't go out much.)<br/><br/>The teacher Ryzhik's story about the evil entrance exam he sat is so, so sad:<br/><blockquote><i>  “Coffins” were questions specially designed for the Jewish applicants... rejection was administered in a peculiarly sadistic way... if [Jews] succeeded in answering correctly the two or three questions on the ticket, then, alone in the room with the examiners, they would be casually issued an extra question... a problem not merely complex but unsolvable. The examiners would then nail the cover of the coffin shut: the Jewish applicant had failed the exam...<br/><br/>""They did not even manage to find a problem I couldn't solve; I sat for three hours after the exam was over, I solved them all, and still they failed me. I was just a boy. I went home and cried.""<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Gessen is well-placed to write this - she was a maths nerd in Soviet Russia around the same time. As far as I can tell (which isn't very far) her grasp of the maths (one chapter for the crown jewel) is fit for purpose. But Gessen is out to bust Perelman's reputation for hyper-individualism; so she focusses on the devoted teachers and functionaries that pulled strings to get an abrasive Jew into the heart of Soviet academia, and his incredible luck in starting graduate study just as Glasnost happened.<br/><br/>    She wants to highlight the poverty of his character - his antisocial withdrawal, his complete and intentional ignorance of politics, his naivete, his savantism. It doesn't work. Yes, he's rigid; maybe he is composed of a curiosity, a competitiveness, an ethics, and nothing else (no vanity, humour, romance, charisma, empathy, theory of mind, tolerance, compromise, doubt). <br/><br/>So what? Why does everyone need to be rounded? Does she sneer at athletes, the other people with lives this seemingly contorted and simple? <a href=""https://www.esquire.com/sports/a5151/the-string-theory-david-foster-wallace/"">David Foster Wallace</a> managed to get over himself, on this note:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    The restrictions on [pro tennis player's] life have been, in my opinion, grotesque; and in certain ways Joyce himself is a grotesque. But the radical compression of his attention and sense of himself have allowed him to become a transcendent practitioner of an art – something few of us get to be. They've allowed him to visit and test parts of his psychic reserves most of us do not even know for sure we have (courage, playing with violent nausea, not choking, et cetera).<br/><br/>Joyce is, in other words, a complete man, though in a grotesquely limited way. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>    Gessen is, to be frank, quite cruel: she never passes up an opportunity to mention appearances - that that athletic boy of 1970 is ""<i>now an overweight and balding computer scientist</i>"", that the house of a man caring for his wife with late-stage dementia is ""<i>a messy place, lived in awkwardly</i>"" and he himself ""<i>similarly unkempt</i>""; that Perelman didn't change his underwear or clip his nails as a teen. This is the shallow side of the <i><a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/masha-gessen"">New Yorker</a></i> style on show - or else the malign side of Russian honesty. Either way fuck it. (Though Perelman would probably approve.)<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>   [Perelman] sounded his voice only if a solution required his intervention; looked forward to Sundays, sighing happily and saying that he could ""finally solve some problems in peace""; and, if asked, patiently explained any math issue to any of his classmates though apparently utterly unable to conceive of anyone not comprehending such a simple thing. His classmates repaid him with kindness: they recalled his civility and his mathematics, and none ever mentioned to me that he walked around with his shoelaces undone...<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>The great mystery, which Gessen understandably can't touch, is why after 36 years of focus he suddenly stopped doing the only thing he'd ever done. How could he? How can that much momentum be shed? What does such a man do next?<br/><br/>Subtract a star if you don't care about maths or if you can't abide people being mean to nerds (as both the old apparatchiks and Gessen were).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>* One of the oddest things about Perelman, because it maybe explains him turning down a million quid and the highest honours the world can bestow, is that he'd disagree with that sentence: <i>maths</i>, the least animal and least irrational thing we have, is too political for him. There was <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau#Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture_controversy"">a little bit</a> of nasty jostling at the time of the announcement - but nothing compared to any other science, let alone any government. Maybe the bubble everyone set up for him was bad for him, because it robbed him of perspective and so made the mild case of fuckery seem like a complete invalidation of mathematical culture. But maybe a rigorous rule-based mind would always explode eventually even given a scale to measure instances of bias.",,,1,0

If you compare the output of the first half of his life to the second, sure it looks bad. But he was giving classical physics (determinism, continuousness, simplicity, fierce parsimony, beauty-based reasoning) a well-deserved last shake. <br/><br/>Imagine the strength of will needed to maintain full-time effort over thirty years of failures, with your whipsmart peers all tutting and ignoring you. His <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_unified_field_theories#Einstein.27s_geometric_approaches"">unified field</a> efforts are methodologically sort of like string theory: a hubristic search over mathematical forms without contact with the actually physical to help limit the formal space.<br/><br/>And he actually had a decent decision-theoretic argument for his doomed crusade:<br/><blockquote> <i>When a colleague asked him one day why he was spending — perhaps squandering — his time in this lonely endeavor, he replied that even if the chance of finding a unified theory was small, the attempt was worthy. He had already made his name, he noted. His position was secure, and he could afford to take the risk and expend the time. A younger theorist, however, could not take such a risk, for he might thus sacrifice a promising career. So, Einstein said, it was his duty to do it.</i></blockquote><br/>People also try to attach shame to him for his wildly stubborn anti-Copenhagen crusade: years spent thinking up tricky counterexamples for the young mechanicians, like an angry philosopher. But I think he had a good effect on the discourse, constantly calling them to order, and leaving it clear, after all, that it <i>is</i> a consistent view of the evidence. <br/><br/>The only unforgiveable bit in his later conservatism is that he ignored the other half of the fundamental forces, the strong and weak forces, and for decades. Two forces was hard enough to unify. I suppose another point against his long, long Advanced Studies is that he could have done even more if he had helped <i>push</i> QM along; as late as 1946, Wheeler tried to convince him to join in. As it is we have evidence against the unified field: ""<i>Einstein</i> failed"".<br/><br/><center>**************************************************</center><br/><br/>Einstein is like Bertrand Russell, only <i>much</i> more so: even more brilliant, even more rebellious, even more politically active, even more aloof, even more relentless, even more neglectful of his family. (Russell, on hearing relativity for the first time: ""<i>To think I have spent my life on absolute muck</i>."") <br/><br/>Along with Ibn Rushd, Leonardo, Pascal, Leibniz, Darwin, Peirce, Russell, Turing, Chomsky, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._C._MacKay"">Mackay</a>*, Einstein is one of our rare <i>complete</i> intellectuals: huge achievements in science, beautiful writing, good jokes, original philosophy, moral seriousness. To have warmth too, as Einstein does abundantly, doesn't have much of a precedent. However much Einstein is <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=einstein+quotes&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipzLzD8NTUAhXESRoKHbMsC4MQ_AUIBigB&biw=1091&bih=561"">misattributed</a> vaguely pleasant, vaguely droll, vaguely radical statements, the fact is he actually <i>was</i> brilliant, pleasant, funny, radical.

(As the noted writer against scientism, Ludwig Wittgenstein <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=Last+Writings+on+the+Philosophy+of+Psychology#q=%22scientific+progress+useful%22+Last+Writings+on+the+Philosophy+of+Psychology"">put it</a>: <br/><blockquote><br/>   Is scientific progress useful for philosophy?

But his other qualities are huge and unique: he knew some of the protagonists personally, and worked on nuclear weaponry himself. He <i>is</i> out to get Heisenberg, and overreads a few times. But this is because people (Powers, Frayn to a degree) persist in rose-tinting him: there's this idea that Heisenberg feigned incompetence at reactor-making as anti-Nazi activism. The transcripts make clear that he'd have made a bomb if he could, not because he is a Nazi or a German but because he was amorally curious, and hungry for primacy. Heisenberg does object to Nazism. But not very strongly. <br/><br/>Bernstein's conclusion is that the project was pretty much a shambles. They had a two-year head start on the Allies, but failed for several reasons: they had < 1% of the funding of the Manhattan Project, an unbelievably bad administration and communication of data and ideas, and key resources like deuterium kept getting bombed. But Bernstein feels able to go for the jugular: <br/><blockquote><i> reading this lecture, I am once again struck by the intellectual thinness of this group. Here are ten German nuclear scientists — nine if one does not count von Laue — who are supposed to be the cream of the crop, the intellectual elite, of German nuclear physics, men who had been working on these questions for several years. And look at the discussion it produced.<br/><br/> To see what I have in mind, let us entertain the following fantasy.

In the late 1940s, during the Chinese civil war, Erdős took part in a food drive for the Communist Chinese. ""I remember walking into a big room in Los Angeles, at UCLA, I think,"" said Vazsonyi, ""and there was Erdős and all these people making packages of food. Some mischief-makers who knew of his disgust at naked women offered to make a $100 donation if he'd go with them to a burlesque show."" To their astonishment, he immediately took them up on the offer. Afterwards, when they forked over the $100, he revealed the secret of his victory: ""See! I tricked you, you trivial beings!

So, superficially, the book is just about an especially  <a name=""people""></a>fruity context of discovery. But this period holds two of the most important lessons in history: 1) science grew out of work by people who diverge wildly from the modern idea and practice of science, whose variously false frameworks led to the Royal Society and e.g. the Newtonian triumph. (And from there to contemporary, professional, university science.) So wrong people can still make progress if their errors are uncorrelated with the prevailing errors. And, 2) a small number of the most powerful people in Britain - the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon"">Lord Chancellor</a>, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Scarborough"">king's</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey#Excursions_abroad.2C_election_as_physician_to_Charles_I_and_the_English_Civil_War"">physicians</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkins"">the chaplain</a> of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_Louis,_Elector_Palatine"">young Elector Palatine</a> and bishop of Chester, London's great <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren#Architectural_career"">architect</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moray"">Privy Councillors</a> <a href=""#bigfrankb"">*</a> - successfully pushed a massive philosophical change, and thereby contributed to most of our greatest achievements: smallpox eradication, Sputnik and Voyager, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution"">Green Revolution</a>, and the unmanageably broad boons of computing are partly theirs. <br/><br/>The received view of all this is one-dimensional: you have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_Concerning_the_Two_Chief_World_Systems"">superstitious, pompous cretins</a> at one end and rational, experimental moderns at the other.<br/><br/>But really you need five axes before you get a basic understanding of the great, great revolution that began in the C16th - before you can see how science differs from every other community: <br/><br/><ul><br/><li><b>Supernaturalism vs Naturalism</b>. Did they explain things solely in terms of natural causes? (Absentee Gods only.)</li><br/><li><b>Apriori vs Aposteriori</b>. Did they view actual observation as decisive and indispensable? <a href=""#empiricism"">**</a></li><br/><li><b>Qualitative vs Quantitative.</b> Did they make measurements? Did they model the data? Did they use standard units?</li><br/><li><b>Holism vs Reductionism.</b> Did they analyse things into their constituent features? Did they explain phenomena in terms of ?</li><br/><li><b>Infallibilism vs Fallibilism.</b> Did they allow for the possibility of error? Did they view uncertain knowledge as still worthwhile? <a href=""#fallibilism"">***</a></li><br/>****<br/></ul>^<br/><br/>So I'm modelling science as naturalist, fallibilist, quantitative empiricism with pretensions to openness. I've categorised the early scientists mentioned in <i>Curiosity</i> according to this: you can see <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Bw1pqa-ZcGza9P3jV7wht8o9-xEJw0A0GpdN733MqE/edit?usp=sharing"">the data with additional justifications here</a>. (Ball doesn't state this model, but it floats around in his debunkings and ""well actually""s.)<br/><br/>All of the pieces of science are very ancient - we had mathematics and data collection <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322"">well before the Ten Commandments</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus"">naturalism</a> before Buddha and Confucius, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism#Greek_atomism"">reductionism</a> before the Peloponnesian War at least <a href=""http://tunesforbears.com/a-history-of-randomization/"">one controlled trial</a> centuries before Christ, <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/carneades/#3"">fallibilism</a> likewise. Everything was ready BCE; we can see indirect evidence of this in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile"">astonishing</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_screw"">works</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesibius#Inventions"">of</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byzantium#Devices"">Ancient Greek</a> engineers, mostly unmatched for 1000 years until y'know. <br/><br/>So the question is not ""was Bacon the most original blah blah?"": he wasn't, particularly when you remember Alhazen's Baconian method, developed in the C11th. But we need an explanation for how we messed it up so badly. The received view, which is all I have at the moment, is that the fall of Rome, Christian anti-intellectualism and, later, the enshrining of Aristotelian mistakes was enough to destroy and suppress the ideas. I want deeper explanations though. (For instance, what did we do to the economy?)<br/><br/>A fun regression on this data would be to see how my scienciness measure correlates with the importance of the person's work. It would not be that highly proportional, in this time period. <br/><br/><br/>***************************************************************<br/><br/>Back to the book eh! Book structure is lots of little chapters on fairly disjointed topics: early modern ideas of space travel, universal language, pumps, etc. Chapter on ""cabinets of curiosity"" is great though: suddenly their dull zany blare makes sense and I want to build one:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>this was more than a case of 'look what I've got'. The power with which </i>Wunderkammern<i> were imbued was... in that they created their own complete microcosm: a representation of the world in miniature... By possessing this microcosm the collector-prince was not just symbolising but also in a sense </i>exercising<i> his mastery of the world. The cabinet acted as a kind of mental laboratory within which the relationships between things could be contemplated via a process that shared elements of both experimentation and Gnostic revelation.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>Ball doesn't like us calling the Scientific Revolution a revolution, and I agree: the revolution didn't consist in the theories of Bacon or Newton: it consists in the diffusion of the worldview into all subjects and all inquiry. It transformed society and gave us marvels, but it hasn't finished happening. The general will, or default state, is still strongly unscientific. (The largest and most grievous holdout, larger even than the enduring hold of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fideism"">fideist</a> religion, is our tribal politics and our largely nonempirical government policy.)<br/><br/>Ball expends a lot of time on a history of wonder vs curiosity vs dispassionate robot inquiry. People hated all of these things for various reasons, up until the Renaissance when curiosity became acceptable on what are now <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_skies_research"">classic economic grounds</a>, or in line with the Italian cult of the virtuoso - someone who's so bloody brilliant that you have to just let him get on with it.<br/><br/>I always like Ball's drawling prose and catty editorialising. (For instance, Margaret Cavendish - the darling of arts academics who latch on to the only woman in sight in this period - gets a round dissing by Ball, as an anti-experiment idiot, a vitalist, and a misogynist.) Stimulating as always.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Bacon has some claim to being the most influential philosopher ever, in terms of counterfactual effect on history. (Rather than number of bloody citations!) No-one with his social standing was resisting the Aristotelian consensus in 1620; his prototype scientific method is a century ahead of its time. (Yes, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham#Scientific_method"">ibn al-Haytham</a>'s was 7 centuries ahead of its time, but to limited avail.)<a href=""#people"">⏎</a><br/><a name=""empiricism""></a> <br/><br/>** This one is hard to refer to, because we now find it incredibly easy to understand why ""go and look"" works as a general route to knowledge; Medieval thought rejected this on the basis of things like the problem of induction. <br/><br/>The cliched way to refer to the split between those who want to <i>start</i> with the apriori and those who want to start with data is ""Rationalism"" vs ""Empiricism"". But these words <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/27/why-i-am-not-rene-descartes/"">confuse people</a>: the two of them are also used in a C17th debate about psychology, to do with the nature of mental content. <br/><br/>More: it can't be a dichotomy, since many of the greatest rationalists (Descartes, Leibniz) were experimentalists too, doing what we now call empirical work. Three meanings of rationalism, and three words for them:<br/><ul><li>'Rationalism<sub>1</sub>': Belief in innate ideas. Call it 'Continental Rationalism'. Descartes and Leibniz but not Dawkins and Shermer.</li><br/><li>'Rationalism<sub>2</sub>': Belief in the supremacy of apriori knowledge over empirical knowledge. Call it 'apriorism'. Aristotle was apriorist, as was Descartes.</li><br/><li>'Rationalism<sub>3</sub>': Belief that everything should be subject to reason and evidence. Includes Descartes and Leibniz <i>and</i> Dawkins and Shermer. Contemporary rationalists are highly if not radically empiricist.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><br/>I use <a href=""https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2011/07/leibniz-experimental-philosopher/"">Alberto Vanzo</a>'s criteria for deciding if someone was enough of an experimentalist:<br/><blockquote><blockquote><i> let us consider four typical features of early modern experimental philosophers:<br/><br/>    <ul><li></i>self-descriptions<i>: experimental philosophers typically called themselves such. At the very least, they professed their sympathy towards experimental philosophy.</li><br/>   <li></i>friends and foes<i>: experimental philosophers saw themselves as part of a tradition whose “patriarch” was Bacon and whose sworn enemy was Cartesian natural philosophy.</li><br/>    <li></i>method<i>: experimental philosophers put forward a two-stage model of natural philosophical inquiry: first, collect data by means of experiments and observations; second, build theories on the basis of them. In general, experimental philosophers emphasized the a posteriori origins of our knowledge of nature and they were wary of a priori reasonings.</li><br/>    <li></i>rhetoric<i>: in the jargon of experimental philosophers, the terms “experiments” and “observations” are good, “hypotheses” and “speculations” are bad. They were often described as fictions, romances, or castles in the air.</i></li><br/></ul><br/></blockquote></blockquote><br/>This is unusually inclusive: the famous Rationalist Leibniz counts as experimental under this rubric. But a stronger definition of aposteriorist - like ""refuses to use purely analytic reasoning"", or even ""spent most of their time running experiments and analysing data"" would exclude many contemporary scientists. Sticking with Vanzo for now.  <a href=""#model"">⏎</a><br/><br/><a name=""fallibilism""></a><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*** Hard to imagine a fallibilist apriorist: perhaps Lakatos. (Some say Leibniz was, in practice.) I actually have met a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism_(philosophy)"">methodist</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_skepticism"">infallibilist apriorist</a>, but I won't meet another.  <a href=""#model"">⏎</a><br/><a name=""openness""></a><br/><br/><br/>**** I had included ""openness"" in the model -<br/><ul><br/><li><b>Obscurantism vs Openness.</b> Did they write in the vernacular? Did they publish for a wide readership? Did they spurn Noble Lies? Did they encourage replications with and data sharing? Did they build scholarly networks?</li><br/></ul><br/>- but I admit this is just wishful/normative thinking: modern academic science fails at this. Whether with its low-status replications, unreadable prose, paywalls on most research (tax-funded or no), pathetically low levels of data sharing, or the <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2015-cofnas.pdf"">prevalence of noble lies</a>... But it's definitely a core <i>aspiration</i> now: the greedy impulse behind hermeticism is blatantly unscientific, if not actually shunned by actual scientists. First, lip service...  <br/><br/>Things can be science without being published, obviously: consider the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#History"">invention of public key cryptography</a> by a GCHQ wonk, classified for 25 years - or even the secret <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading#Low-latency_strategies"">infrastructure</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading#Statistical_arbitrage"">algorithmics</a> of high-frequency trading.<br/><br/>^ Obviously these five factors aren't the end of the matter either. But I reckon it catches a decent amount of the variance in the term ""scientist"". Others e.g.<br/><ul><br/><li>Particularism vs Consilience. Did they believe that the scientific method could explain every phenomenon?</li><br/><li>Realism vs Instrumentalism. Most scientists are realists about best current theories</li><br/><li>Theism vs Nontheism</li><br/></ul><br/>I <i>had</i> included non-theism in the core of modern science - and so it is, in the form of strong naturalism. Scient<i>ists</i>, on the other hand, differ from this, globally. This is partially because humans are so compartmentalised and can hold severe contradictions indefinitely. But, clearly, atheism is not an essential part of the modern method. But <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_closure"">causal closure</a> and (at most) a <i>private</i> faith are.",,,1,0

Ramanujan's story is of course maximally moving to anyone with a shred of curiosity or pity. The most moving part of all is an absence, one of the darker thoughts among all thoughts: <br/><blockquote><br/><i>How many Ramanujans, his life begs us to ask, dwell in India today, unknown and unrecognized? And how many in America and Britain, locked away in racial or economic ghettos, scarcely aware of worlds outside their own?</i><br/></blockquote><br/>His research is patent throughout: he decodes South Indian religion and cuisine, British upper-class slang, and even something of the impressiveness of higher mathematics, while using mere natural language:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>Ramanujan's work grants direct pleasure to only a few - a few hundred mathematicians and physicists around the world, perhaps a few thousand. The rest of us must either sit on the sidelines, and, on the authority of the cognoscenti, cheer - or else rely on vague, metaphoric, and necessarily imprecise glimpses of his work.</i><br/><br/><i>...mathematics is not best learned passively; you don’t sop it up like a romance novel. You’ve got to go out to it, aggressive, and alert, like a chess master pursuing checkmate.</i></blockquote><br/>Ramanujan himself left a tiny dense literature that we are still decoding:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>Ramanujan's notebooks formed a distinctly idiosyncratic record. In them even widely standardized terms sometimes acquired new meaning. Thus, an ""example"" — normally, as in everyday usage, an illustration of a general principle — was for Ramanujan often a wholly new theorem. A ""corollary"" — a theorem flowing naturally from another theorem and so requiring no separate proof — was for him sometimes a generalization, which did require its own proof. As for his mathematical notation, it sometimes bore scant resemblance to anyone else's.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>Many passages raise goosebumps: Kanigel unites the abstract and the bodily, the true and the human all-too-human.<br/><blockquote><br/><i>You cannot say much about Ramanujan without resorting to the word </i>self<i>. He was self-willed, self-directed, self-made. Some might conceivably label him selfish for his preoccupation with doing the mathematics he loved without any great concern for the better of his family or his country...<br/><br/>Hardy discovered Ramanujan?

The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140123-spanish-flu-1918-china-origins-pandemic-science-health/"">human displacements</a>. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.<br/><br/>The book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>Man might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.<br/><br/>By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>There's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was ""the withered arm of science"". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, ""we can't really do anything"") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.</i></blockquote><br/>Problem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.<br/><br/>Few people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae"">the wrong pathogen</a>, due to a bad guess by an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Friedrich_Johannes_Pfeiffer"">extremely eminent researcher</a>.<br/><br/>Because so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:<br/><blockquote><i>In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. <br/><br/>The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.<br/><br/>When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...<br/><br/>Starr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.<br/><br/>Nearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...<br/>The city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Everyone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.<br/><blockquote><i>The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.<br/><br/>The police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow...<br> More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.</i></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote>""<i>There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. ""</i></blockquote>- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.<br/><br/><br/>Wilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. (""<i>at last the world knows America as the savior of the world</i>!"") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and <a href=""https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/germany-telegraphs-president-wilson-seeking-armistice"">with the Kaiser's new parliament</a> in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/search?dcr=0&q=18000000+%2F+1559+*+70&oq=18000000+%2F+1559+*+70&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1761.1839.0.1945.2.2.0.0.0.0.87.87.1.1.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..2.0.0.UNPLBXOgOHQ"">800,000</a> completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.<br/><br/><blockquote><i> the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. </i></blockquote><br/><br/>Barry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Act_of_1918"">ban on criticising the government</a>. But then there's the unofficial ""patriotic duties"", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.<br/><br/>He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.<br/><br/>He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_L._Berger"">a congressman</a>.<br/><br/>He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...<br/><br/>Crowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect...""<br/><br/>In mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.<br/><br/>Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...<br/><br/>If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources.<br/><br/>...the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Because the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:<br/><blockquote><i>In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...<br/><br/>The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”<br/><br/>The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs.  The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. </i></blockquote><br/><br/>---<br/>Barry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having ""no standards for admission"":<br/><blockquote><i>  In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. <br/></i></blockquote><br/>But his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.<br/><br/>I suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)<br/>---<br/><br/>PS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist <a href=""http://www.virology.ws/2009/08/14/the-problems-with-barrys-the-great-influenza/"">here</a>.

It means you’ve been merciful to someone you could just as easily squash like a bug... Marvel’s mutants are something like that.

It wards off colds and the flu. It lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke, not to mention diabetes. You’ll even feel happier, less depressed, and less anxious. Are you interested?<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Important topic: he claims there's a free, riskless intervention to add years to your lifespan and fundamentally improve your mind. (The flip side of this claim is a horror story about a society that mentally disables its members.)<br/><br/>Our school system, ladies and gents:<br/><blockquote><i>	More than 80 percent of public high schools in the United States begin before 8:15 a.m. Almost 50 percent of those start before 7:20 a.m. School buses for a 7:20 a.m. start time usually begin picking up kids at around 5:45 a.m. As a result, some children and teenagers must wake up at 5:30 a.m., 5:15 a.m., or even earlier, and do so five days out of every seven, for years on end. This is lunacy...<br/><br/>	Previously, we noted that the circadian rhythm of teenagers shifts forward dramatically by one to three hours. So really the question I should ask you, if you are an adult, is this: Could you concentrate and learn anything after having forcefully been woken up at 3:15 a.m., day after day after day? Would you be in a cheerful mood? Would you find it easy to get along with your coworkers and conduct yourself with grace, tolerance, respect, and a pleasant demeanor? Of course not. Why, then, do we ask this of the millions of teenagers and children in industrialized nations?<br/></blockquote></i><br/>And elsewhere he notes that time in school is useless without restfulness. Burn it down.<br/><blockquote><i>	Insufficient sleep has also been linked to aggression, bullying, and behavioral problems in children across a range of ages. A similar relationship between a lack of sleep and violence has been observed in adult prison populations; places that, I should add, are woefully poor at enabling good sleep that could reduce aggression, violence, psychiatric disturbance, and suicide<br/></blockquote></i><br/>The theory of sleep (circadian rhythm and adenosine cycle determining when, NREM and REM determining what) is very neat but I'm not qualified to say if it's mature. There's also vast and baffling cross-species variation, which Walker doesn't pretend to understand: ""<i>amount (e.g., [hours per day]), form (e.g., half-brain, whole-brain), and pattern (monophasic, biphasic, polyphasic)</i>"" or ground / tree.<br/><br/>The adenosine cycle - the absolutely failsafe connection between activity and fatigue - is one of my favourite theories in biology. (The account here doesn't do it justice.)<br/><br/>He's sceptical of <a href=""http://gwern.net/Melatonin"">oral melatonin</a> <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/10/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/"">therapy</a>, but he doesn't consider the main argument in favour, which is that our many hours of blue-light at night is a systematic deviation from ancestral conditions, with no sensible alternative mitigation (f.lux can only do so much). (He instead puts faith in warm LEDs and smart bulbs, currently thousands of dollars each.) At least he doesn't spread the <a href=""https://examine.com/supplements/melatonin/"">unsupported idea</a> that taking it results in negative hormonal feedback.  This doesn't surprise me:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>	Scientific evaluations of over-the-counter brands have found melatonin concentrations that range from 83 percent less than that claimed on the label, to 478 percent more than that stated<br/></blockquote></i><br/>- but this is the price of having it over-the-counter in the first place. (It is anyway completely safe to take a 6x dose, just much less effective.)<br/><br/>He's very in favour of afternoon naps, the ""biphasic"" pattern, based on relatively weak observational evidence:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>	those that abandoned regular siestas went on to suffer a 37 percent increased risk of death from heart disease across the six-year period, relative to those who maintained regular daytime naps.""<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>There's lots of evolutionary speculation, which really pisses off some readers for some reason, even when tagged as speculation. (e.g. Do teenagers stay up later to procreate outwith parental supervision?)<br/><br/>He is a crusader all right - for instance, he doesn't really do any cost-benefit consideration, instead just maximising sleep, even instead of taking your asthma meds. Yes, the costs of sleep deprivation are extremely high - but so's the cost of <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7972077/against-oversleeping"">spending 30 years in a coma</a>.<br/><br/>I think I'm pretty much optimised: I already quit caffeine, redshifted all screens, got 0.3mg melatonin, started wearing an eye mask, don't drink much, exercise every day, fixed a bedtime, and live somewhere quiet with big bedroom windows. (I also got a less melodramatic and anxious worldview by studying <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2426950247"">economic history</a>, which Walker doesn't cover - fair enough, since the intervention can only help scared intellectuals.) Things which I enjoy enough to handle the sleep cost: nicotine and eating late. <br/><br/><br/><blockquote><i>Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep:<br/><br/>1. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.<br/>2. Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. <br/>3. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. <br/>4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. <br/>5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. <br/>6. If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep.<br/>7. Don’t take naps after 3 p.m. <br/>8. Relax before bed... reading or listening to music, should be part of your bedtime ritual.<br/>9. Take a hot bath before bed. <br/>10. Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom.<br/>11. Have the right sunlight exposure. Try to get outside in natural sunlight for at least thirty minutes each day.<br/>12. Don’t lie in bed awake... get up and do some relaxing activity until you feel sleepy. <br/><br/></blockquote></i>",,,1,0

Lovers parted by conscription, blocks of lives traded for nothing, the belligerent joy of a public which hasn't lost its first battle yet.

This execution took the best part of half an hour, and Zink had to stop and catch his breath twice. More than twice, he forgot what he was about and began to carry the ladder back to the hut. When he reached the wall, he came about, two points, low stride, west rotation, and dragged the ladder into the wet flowerbeds.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>I struggle a bit with the psychology of the wicked Satanic enemy. Even in thoughtful authors like Abnett their motivations and strategies are too predictably vicious, too unsustainable - they've invaded this planet, fine, but then they blow up half the cities in it. So what's the point of invading?<br/><blockquote><i>The archenemy, in his long experience, often ignored <br/>tactical logic or strategic merit, but this was an odd choice even by the archenemy’s perverse standards.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>An enemy who was so haphazard, divided, unstrategic would struggle to threaten a whole organised empire. They could just be terrorists, or value suffering itself, or just be damaging infrastructure for the wider conflict. But this is a flat worldview, one you can't do anything with except backdrop the nobility of your own characters. Which is one reason there's not a lot of literature in this canon. Abnett compensates well as usual, with flawed and distinctive protagonists, rigorous fantasy logistics and tactics, nice setpieces, plenty of humanising nonmilitary detail, and good satisfying betrayals.",,,1,0

Ordinary C15th cannon are an experimental wunderweapon to them. <br/>More: most births have some risk (<1%) of being a giant nuclear volcano generator, but the Evil Empire does nothing to control reproduction, and has the parents administer very insecure self-regulation. <br/><br/><b>Pretentious portentousness</b>:<br/><blockquote><i>There passes a time of happiness in your life, which I will not describe to you. It is unimportant. Perhaps you think it wrong that I dwell so much on the horrors, the pain, but pain is what shapes us, after all. We are creatures born of heat and pressure and grinding, ceaseless movement. To be still is to be... not.<br/></blockquote></i>Of a character which until about 10 pages earlier had been a despised / tolerated frenemy:<br/><blockquote><i>now your eyes are drawn away from the horror that remains of your mentor, your lover, your friend...</blockquote></i><br/>I forgive Ada Palmer this style. But 1) she's not that bad; 2) she's aping the sentimentalist C18th, and 3) she has far greater philosophical sense.<br/><br/><b>Glib</b>: <br/><blockquote><i>it turns out that the comm is called Meov, and the man who has stepped forward is Harlas, their headman. <br/>Also they're pirates.</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>Syenite mispronounces vulgar words, inadvertently making them more vulgar, and makes instant friends of half the crew by doing so.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>""lol, applause!""<br/><br/><b>Bad slang</b>: ""rogga"", ""comm"", ""orogeny"" (every time, I thought ""erogenous?""), really bad interjections (<i>' ""Evil, eating Earth"", you whisper'</i>; '<i>for shit's sake, she stilled a rusting volcano made by a broken obelisk</i>'). The occasional good bit of slang (like ""grits"" for the young rock mages) is smothered in exposition: <i>that's what she is now, an unimportant bit  of rock ready to be polished into usefulness...</i>. Better writers (Atwood or Le Guin or Banks) leave it up to you. Everything is spelled out here.<br/><br/>The book gets roundly worse in the second half, with two chapters (16 and 17) full of hollow plot devices and applause lights (Damaya only explores the Main building so she can drive the plot forward when the hollow character Binof arrives, immediately afterwards). Also arguably Innon, there to be objectified and let Jemisin write 'good sex' scenes.<br/><br/>Lots of Representation: polyamory, transgenderism, a dozen skin colours. Of course, fantasy doesn't represent anything, so strictly speaking that's a misnomer. It doesn't matter what the ethnic demographics of your lava-world are, relative to ours; you can have as much or as little typical sexuality etc as you like, any colour can be a minority, <i>as long as it makes sense in that world</i>. Do the choices of identities fit Jemisin's world? Is Tonkee's transgenderism, among feudalism, a personal idiosyncrasy? A hormone thing? A magic thing? We're given no reason for any of the identities she introduces to celebrate. But it mostly doesn't get in the way.<br/><br/><br/>Jemisin fumbles the ""in a corrupt world, lawful complicity or violent revolution?"" angle. At least in this instalment, there's little acknowledgment that killing an entire city because a handful of people in its government committed atrocities isn't on: '<i>He's not crazy at all, and he never has been</i>' <br/>""<i>what right do worlds built on oppression and genocide have to exist?</i>"", asks one reviewer. Well, 'worlds' (institutions) don't have rights, people do: and people have a right to not suffer harm, e.g. the harm of having a great big earthquake dropped on you.",true,,1,0

(zero-sum and of no private or social gain)</li> <br/></ol><br/>His conclusion is that about 80% of the personal economic gains from higher education are from (4): <i>not</i> improving your character, knowledge, or ability, but rather from certifying yourself as a good worker (smart, conscientious, conformist). Given the vast cost, time sink, and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/education/series/mental-health-a-university-crisis"">psychological toll</a> of education, this implies a hugely wasteful, zero-sum arms race (grade inflation, degree inflation), since the income gain doesn't reflect productivity gain, and since we could be doing signalling in less indirect and foolish ways. I'll do a proper rundown of the (many) arguments he gives to end up at this separately.<br/><br/>The mostly-signalling theory explains a huge number of confusing features (why do students and employers not value Ivy League MOOCs, even ten years on? Why are most of the income rewards concentrated in the instant of graduation? Why do students cheer when class is cancelled? If lectures are so economically powerful, why don't people just sit in on them without enrolling (and why doesn't the university put security on them to protect their livelihood)? How can human capital explain the income gains, when people forget almost everything about their major within 5 years and don't show very large soft skill increases?<br/><br/>You often see people trumpeting the large (<a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/305e85d4-6489-11e6-a08a-c7ac04ef00aa"">50-60%</a>) income premium of higher education, as if that showed that added human capital was the reason for the premium (cough, correlation / causation). But even granting that uncritical leap, there's something strange about focussing on private income gains: the kind of people who believe in the centrality of education tend also to believe that pay is a poor indicator of social value. (For instance, our incredibly low opinion of investment bankers.) Caplan's disturbing point is that the private returns do not translate into social returns. This seeming paradox could happen a few ways: if credential inflation shifts jobs from nongraduates to graduates; or if there <i>are</i> minor human capital gains, but swamped out by the huge financial cost and time cost of uni. <br/><br/>My philosophy department used to trumpet graduate income stats as evidence that critical thinking is valued in industry. (They don't anymore, possibly because <a href=""https://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Earnings-by-Degrees-REPORT-1.pdf"">philosophy is now associated with decreased earnings</a>, at least in the UK.)  This trump was an amusing triple failure of critical thinking: they confuse correlation and causation (""philosophy degree and income gain, therefore philosophy degree causes income gain""), fail to consider selection effects (philosophy students start out posher than the average student) <i>and</i> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician%27s_syllogism"">the <i>Yes Minister</i> fallacy</a>:<br/><ol><br/><li>A philosophy degree causes an income premium.</li><br/><li>If something causes an income premium then it is valued in industry.</li><br/><li>A philosophy degree causes critical thinking.</li><br/><li>Therefore, critical thinking is valued in industry.</li><br/></ol><br/><br/>The big concern with the sweeping cuts Caplan recommends is: how do you stop poor people losing their ability to signal their virtues, if the state withdraws the current subsidy? <br/><br/>Remarkably, the book is in large part not based on economists' research: there is as much sociology, . This triangulation strikes me as the way to write lasting social science, social science with a chance of still being relevant in a decade. Who writes like this, aside from <a href=""https://publicchoice.gmu.edu/faculty-and-staff"">the GMU mob</a>?<br/><br/>Caplan is modest, thoughtful, an admirable empiricist. If you can't accept his argument you have a lot of work to do before you break even.",,,1,0

(Some set theory wouldn't go amiss either.) Parts of it treat nearly-irrelevant dead controversies, just because he was still fighting off the McCarthy / production systems programme in the late Eighties. (For instance, I learned Dempster-Shafer theory in class, and it is <a href=""https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/161879782549/bayes-a-kinda-sorta-masterpost"">sorta interesting</a> and neatly evades Cox's theorem, but I still expect never to have to use it. It gets more than 50 pages here.) Bayesian networks, ingenious and progressive as they were, have peaked in use, though <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836213/#__sec5title"">their</a> <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06539"">children</a> are still cutting edge and invaluable for human and nonhuman reasoning.<br/><br/>All that said: Pearl thinks very hard about ultimate matters. He didn't develop Bayesian networks (and causal models) as a hack, but instead as a consequence of showing probabilities to be better than the alternatives when tweaked for computation, subjective Bayesianism to be capable of handling causal inference, graphs as the natural data structure for both relevance and cause, and the causal/evidential decision theory distinction as primal. <br/><blockquote><i>On the surface, there is really no compelling reason that beliefs, being mental dispositions about unrepeatable and often unobservable events, should combine by the laws of proportions that govern repeatable trials such as the outcomes of gambling devices.  The primary appeal of probability theory is its ability to express useful qualitative relationships among beliefs and to process these relationships in a way that yields intuitively plausible conclusions…  What we wish to stress here is that the fortunate match between human intuition and the laws of proportions is not a coincidence. It came about because beliefs are formed not in a vacuum but rather as a distillation of sensory experiences... <br/><br/>We therefore take probability calculus as an initial model of human reasoning from which more refined models may originate, if needed. By exploring the limits of probability in machine implementations, we hope to identify conditions under which extensions, refinements and simplifications are warranted.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Building AI as feedback for formal epistemology! My favourite philosophers are technical like David Lewis; my favourite technical people are philosophical like Pearl. <br/><br/>He's also very good at taking us through a derivation and underlining the big implications (e.g. P(A) = \sum P(A|B_i)  P(B_i) as a model for hypothetical reasoning: belief in event A is a weighted sum over belief in all the ways A can obtain). There's plenty of maths in here but I never struggled much, probably because of this qualitative care of his.<br/><br/><i>PRIS</i> beats the arse off <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36204378-the-book-of-why"">his own 2018 effort</a>, perhaps because at this point he was still working incredibly hard to understand and synthesise competing approaches. Hard to rate. But if you want to seriously think about AI, you'll want to read it at some point.<br/><br/>----------------------------------<br/><br/><i>Misc notes</i><br/><br/>* McCarthy is to probabilities as <a href=""https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/1288/did-minsky-and-papert-know-that-multi-layer-perceptrons-could-solve-xor"">Minsky is to neural nets</a>.

It didn't have to be developed (since probs are adequate for so much), and yet it was, and it evades the normal arguments against other uncertainty measures and is thus alive, if unpopular.

But it peaks with its epigram, Tom Leonard's ""<a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DvG30pFX4AAEV2d.jpg"">Liason Coordinator</a>"".<br/><br/>More of an autobiography than I was expecting, lots about his own insecurities and appalling suffering, the quasi-political rage inspired by them, and his slow maturing into social work and art. Unfortunately the prose is really, really stiff. One of his observations is that poverty makes you unable to articulate poverty. So should I sympathise? I've a similarly uncultured background (though not a tenth as violent) and I still managed to get an ear for High English. (He isn't deep enough to analyse the politics of language, but he namechecks people who do, like Tom Leonard.)<br/><br/>And but you <i>can</i> write in Scots now, if you're great, if you're brave, as shown by Welsh (Booker Prize longlist '93), Kelman (Booker win '94) and Leonard (anthologised in the <i>Penguin Book of English Verse</i>, IMO the highest honour in poetry).<br/><blockquote><i>my sense of grievance with anyone I perceived as well-off. In my community, some people fought about football, others over politics and religion, but my simmering resentment, if not concentrated completely on my mother, lay with those in society who appeared to be doing much better than the rest of us, those who were gliding through life unimpeded by the constraints of poverty and the material disadvantage and self-doubt that comes with it.<br/><br/>This feeling of justifiable anger at the state of things, whether it be my community of even my own life, always led to some form of blame being ascribed to another group in society and, for me, middle class people fitted the bill perfectly. This bee in my bonnett has been a constant and finds expression as a sense of irritation at certain people I assume are posh; I can be irritated by an opinion, an accent, an accessory or an item of clothing...<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>    Many big sociological / psychology claims - some truisms, some false - but almost no citations for either.

Elitism vs racism, individualism vs collectivism, negative freedom vs positive freedom, UBI and/or dignity. Kress' stated goal is to bring together Rand's ideal and Le Guin's (ambiguous) ideal and see how they spark off each other, their repulsion dance.<br/><br/>The first two books seem simple: a good basic dramatisation of the excellence vs equality problem. But stick with it, dialectic comes. Kress is much better at inhabiting other views than Rand, but not quite as good as Le Guin (who surprised me with how ambivalent, careful and detached her books can be, when her essays are so often blunt and denunciatory). Unlike them, Kress allows her ubermenschen to be irrational, as when the Sleepers fall into stupid binary demonisation of the majority outgroup. <spoiler>The Sanctuary bunch start as Objectivists, but are twisted by Jennifer's wealth and terrorism into the worst totalitarian collectivism - one without even pity for misfortune.</spoiler><br/><br/>She climbs inside libertarianism, productivism, Objectivism, elitism - half of the protagonists are deeply, unreflectively into these ideologies for half the book. Leisha finds one fatal flaw with them - society is not a linear series of contracts but a chaotic informal web of micro-contracts and unthinking mutual structuration, with a thin layer of formal voluntary contracts on top.<br/><blockquote><i>She remembered the day she had realized that [Objectivist] economics were not large enough. Their stress on individual excellence left out too many phenomena, too many people: those who had no excellence and never would. The beggars, who nonetheless had definite if obscure roles to play in the way the world ran. They were like parasites on a mammal that torment it to a scratching frenzy that draws blood, but whose eggs serve as food for other insects that feed yet others who fatten the birds that are prey for the rodents the tormented mammal eats. A bloody ecology of trade, replacing the linear Yagaiist contracts occurring in a vacuum. The ecology was large enough to take Sleepers and Sleepless, producers and beggars, the excellent and the mediocre and the seemingly worthless. And what kept the ecology functioning was the law.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Miranda and the supers find another, which is that fortune can mock anyone regardless of momentary strength or weakness.<br/><blockquote><i>Tony, Leisha said silently, there are no permanent beggars in Spain. Or anywhere else. The beggar you give a dollar to today might change the world tomorrow. Or become father to the man who will. Or grandfather, or great-grandfather. There is no stable ecology of trade, as I thought once, when I was very young. There is no stable anything, much less stagnant anything, given enough time. And no nonproductive anything, either. Beggars are only gene lines temporarily between communities.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>The hyper-precocious kids are about as off-putting as those in <i>Ender's Game</i>. I wish she had only given the Sleepless more time than the unmodified - not superintelligence and immortality to boot. This would still be enough to create the tension the plot needs, they'd just grow with a lower exponent, maybe taking 150 rather than 40 years.<br/><br/>Everyone in this book, plus maybe Kress herself, are in serious need of the first lesson of first year economics, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage"">comparative advantage</a>. This says, roughly, that it actually isn't a fatal problem if someone is better than you at every different economic task: they still have limited time, so they can still gain from trading with you (you each produce the thing you're best at making then swap some). This understates the problem with <spoiler>launching your entire city population into space, which is that you've just made transactions costs a thousand times more expensive (Y-energy or no). It would be so hard to make Sanctuary profitable, and yet it's implied to be about the GDP of the entire Decadent 20% Productive USA.</spoiler><br/><br/>Kress portrays a couple of neglected ideologies. One, which determines just as much of world events as liberalism or socialism, has only the ugly name 'productivism' (or maybe also the misleading name 'workaholism'). Leisha is a classic example. On worrying that her elderly stepmother might be just farting around the house: <blockquote><i>Leisha had felt a palpable relief, like a small pop in her chest, when she saw the terminal and medical journals in Susan’s office.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>On her relationship trouble: <blockquote><i>“We’re fine, Susan. We work together really well. That’s what really matters, after all.”<br/></blockquote></i><br/>You can laugh at someone missing the point of life so much, but you should consider how much of what you value depends on people like this. And, when summarised into the long-term growth rate, how much of the vast potential of the future does. (Ada Palmer covers this exact dynamic, as the romantic ""vocateurs"", people of vocation.) And another ideology neglected in fiction: Leisha is a rare instance of ""<a href=""https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/"">bleeding-heart libertarianism</a>"" (another ugly name).<br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/><br/>* Kress:<blockquote><i>Genetic engineering is becoming a reality, one that many people are not ready to acknowledge, let alone allow. But you cannot put the genie back in the bottle. We know how to manipulate the human genome and so, inevitably, we will. The two sequels to </i>Beggars in Spain, Beggars and Choosers and Beggars Ride<i>, explore that issue in as much detail as I could invent. Even so, I didn’t come close to covering the excitement, the changes, the shock, and the controversy that genetic engineering will bring in the coming decades. I just wish that I could stick around for a hundred years or so to see it—and to write about it.<br/></blockquote></i> Nah mate not a hundred years; <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00001-y"">try thirty</a>.<br/><br/>* There are eventually 4 classes: Livers (the idle cosseted underclass), Donkeys (the unmodified workers, the elite Sleepers), Norm Sleepless and the Super Sleepless. <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society"">Ordered pair of ordered pairs</a>.<br/><br/>* One key to the conflicts is that people have grown used to certain ancient inequalities of degree, but new or qualitative ones should awake all of our envy and rage <blockquote><i>Beautiful or brainy children might encounter natural envy, but usually not virulent hatred. They were not viewed as a different race, one endlessly conspiring at power, endlessly controlling behind the scenes, endlessly feared and scorned. The Sleepless,<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>* Most of the big interventions in the book fail. Yagai's gift to the US enables its slide into total indolence and short-termist hedonism. Hawke's nasty uprising for dignified labour morphs into shallow hedonistic <i>Idiocracy</i>, voting for more party money instead of doing things.<br/><br/><br/>* Sanctuary is grandly sick, a monarchy masquerading as half a democracy. (It is not quite as sick and complete as the totalitarianism in Vinge's <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>.) <spoiler>The mad monarch, Jennifer is a blank evil cipher for almost the whole book, eventually cracking during the final confrontation. <blockquote><i>This… child, this girl who had never been spat upon because she was Sleepless… never locked in a room by a mother who was putrid with jealousy of a beauty her daughter would never lose, even as the mother’s beauty was inexorably fading… never locked in a cell away from her children… never betrayed by a husband who hated his own sleeplessness… this spoiled and pampered child who had been given everything was attempting to thwart her, Jennifer Sharifi, who had brought Sanctuary into its very being by the force of her own will.</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>The children looked at their shoes. They were afraid of her, Jennifer saw. That was not bad; fear was only the ancient word for respect.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>She's a paranoid idiot, or rather mindkilled by fear and the dread ruthlessness of a survivor. Witness her adhoc patching of the edge cases of personhood on Sanctuary, her silly fixation on mere sleep and mere relative productivity, which is her downfall. And: What good outcome <i>could</i> there have been from her bioterrorist secession? She's an effective villain despite her inertness because she's so good at manipulating smart well-meaning people into vice. The horror of sophistry.<br/><blockquote><i>She has a right to her life, whatever it is now!”<br/>Jennifer said, “The real question is, do we have the right to sacrifice someone else’s life to the care of hers?”</blockquote></i><br/></spoiler> <br/><br/><br/>* Libertarianism could be a lovely thing, for some other species. It builds a philosophy of life from a completely different direction than mine: top-down, from grand general ideas to morals and behaviour. (Has anyone teased them for having a top-down philosophy which demands the abolition of top-down forces?) The bottom-up approach, missing from this book, is to instead move from experiences, which motivate morals and nonmorals just by you understanding what it is like to experience them. Any subject of experience deserves good; the legal and political implications are distantly contingent on this, and vary massively from time to time as a result. Productivity is good when it leads to good lives: the enlightened definition of 'productive' is whatever does this. If pushpin or cartoons give you pleasure, they're productive. It just happens that there is generally currently millions of times more productive things to do. (The Livers are aesthetically repugnant to me, but eh their lives are better than most.) This isn't as vacuous as it sounds: consider the remarkable goodness of (most of) Jeremy Bentham's beliefs, in a time of universal bigotry. We got better, but we're still not optimising for good vibes.<br/><br/>* ""Community"" is mostly malign here: the zero-sum nativism of We-Sleep, the incoherent defensive supremacism of Sanctuary. The idea does have a black heart: ""<i>us, not them</i>"", but there are better, nicer examples. (I suppose the Supers are the steelman.) The one grace of the instances here is separatism: they don't initially demand mutilation or submission, just space for their difference. We-Sleep is also a pretty weak exemplar for socialism.<br/><blockquote><i>“Wake up, Jordan. No social movement has ever progressed without emphasizing division, and doing that means stirring up hate. The American revolution, abolitionism, unionization, civil rights—”<br/>“That wasn’t—”<br/>“At least we didn’t invent this particular division—the Sleepless did. Feminism, gay rights, Dole franchisement—”</blockquote></i><br/><br/><br/>* The depiction of the supers' thought process is good and novel - they build and collaborate on ""strings"", complicated visual <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_framework"">argumentation models</a>, replacing natural language.<br/><br/>* What is Kress' view? It's not that good a question, given that she's trying to do dialectic between ideologies, and does it pretty well. But if we let Leisha's mature view stand in, there are some authorial-sounding notes <br/><blockquote><i>And throughout it all, the United States: rich, prosperous, myopic, magnificent in aggregate and petty in specifics, unwilling — always, always — to accord mass respect to the mind. To good fortune, to luck, to rugged individualism, to faith in God, to patriotism, to beauty, to spunk or pluck or grit or git, but never to complex intelligence and complex thought. It wasn’t sleeplessness that had caused all the rioting; it was thought and its twin consequences, change and challenge.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Leisha settles on the idea that it is impossible to reconcile solidarity and high-variance freedom, that the attempt to reconcile them drove Jennifer and the US mad. <blockquote><i>When individuals are free to become anything at all, some will become geniuses and some will become resentful beggars. Some will benefit themselves and their communities, and others will benefit no one and just loot whatever they can. Equality disappears. You can’t have both equality and the freedom to pursue individual excellence.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>The book's answer is to not take either horn, to just juggle the contradiction forever. I don't see the dilemma really; you just separate moral worth from ability, then automate the economy: boom, equality and freedom.<br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Maybe five stars on re-read, though the prose might be a bit flat for that (aside from a couple of moving passages, all quoted above) and maybe the dialectic is too heavy-handed.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><i>How does it do as Serious science fiction?</i><br/><br/><i>Social development</i>: Strong. The various caste systems that spring up are believable - for instance the Liver/Donkey one, where the donkeys downplay their own work and set up society as a circus, to short-circuit the questions of employment, dignity, status, revolution. Her nativists are very plausible, though they speak less about ""natural life"" than I expect ours to (the Sleepers seem happy with any genetic modification besides sleeplessness). The elitism of the Sleepless is just a stronger form of the sort already held by certain merely slightly more productive conservatives. Much of the economics is questionable though, particularly the C21st self-sufficient space city of 80,000(?).<br/><br/><i>Software development</i>: Good, though high-level even by fiction's standards. The plot hangs on software (including patent databases), though these are mostly reduced to relative hacking ability. Only Vinge is better.<br/><br/><i>Actual Science</i>: Some very sketchy genetics at the heart of the plot but not much. It's not pure magic - she puts realistically heavy limits on the genetic engineering of adults - but the rest is just assumed.",,,1,0

Stuffed full of plot, rammed full of details - a dozen cities on three planets, each with their own economic or cultural or religious setup. There's: a huge war over economic policy; a primitivist misotheist theocracy; a bunch of murderous millenarians; a group of solipsist mercenaries who each think they're the only person in the world; a World Tree ecology; a giant raft city; a talking deus ex machina; two world conspiracies; a man raised from birth to be the perfect revolutionary leader; the fall of a trillionaire dynasty; terrible, maximally vicious sibling rivalry; a beautiful android city full of likeable people being competent and deep. The protagonists pull off about a dozen missions in varied landscapes with various goals. But it's all just sketched, since the 12 worlds he builds are vying for the same 700 pages. <br/><blockquote><i>We are a race prone to monsters, and when we produce one we worship it. What kind of world, what translation of good could come from all that's happened here?<br/></blockquote></i><br/>And I didn't like any of the protagonists; they're all a glib kind of hedonist. The leader, Sharrow, is <i>tacitly</i> remorseful about the many terrible things she does, but at no point does she stop doing them.<br/><blockquote><i>People were always sorry... The sorrow never stopped them; it just made them feel better. And so the sorrow never stopped.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/><spoiler>The dastardly ubermensch Big Bad only appears in the last 5% of the book.</spoiler><br/><spoiler>Killing Geis with a bullet she wouldn't have if she were more responsible is one way to justify her attitude I guess.</spoiler><br/><spoiler>In killing Geis, Sharrow saves the World Court, or anyway the Court/Rebel States status quo. The ending doesn't resolve anything, fine, but I was amazed that we didn't have her recovering the Gun. It's one thing to leave ambiguity about what's next, but it's not really clear what Sharrow's options are. She lost her crew, killed her family (including the son), is no longer hunted by the Huhsz, gets Feril boxed for a century, has a prosecution coming, and doesn't give a fuck about anything. But she has a cool motorbike.</spoiler><br/><spoiler>Bank's scifi is unusually emotionally fraught, focussed on inner life. Sharrow vs Breyguhn is very tragic and quite believable, for all that it makes me dismiss Sharrow as an impulsive heartless fool.</spoiler><br/><br/>* The Huhsz, the millenarians, are actually quite marginal, despite the first 200 pages setting them up to be central.<br/>* Odd portrait of a very advanced (10000 year old), fairly stable capitalism. They manage to ban things (like bioweapons), and manage to prosecute trillionaires.<br/>* Feril goes straight in the all-time gallery of Wise Cinnamon-bun AIs we don't deserve. (Along with Lt Cmd Data, Constable Dorfl, TARS, Iron Giant, GCU Grey Area, Wall-E).<br/>* I didn't buy the superior ancient tech thing, here. Golter has a mostly-functional academic and state apparatus, and is able to do many things we can't; it's implausible that they wouldn't manage to reverse-engineer things over thousands of years<br/>* Nice echoing of the Solipsists in Sharrow at the end:<br/><blockquote><i>The blood pumped and coursed within her, and with each beat the whole edifice seemed to quake and pulse and shiver, as though for all its mountainous solidity the Sea House was merely a projection, something held in the power of her blood-quickened eyes.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>* The Lazy Guns sound exactly like Culture tech, quasi-sentient to boot. But their presence in this remote ""orphan"" system is odd, and it doesn't fit to have the Culture either dump or lose such weapons.<br/><br/>Banks is less subtle than I thought he was, as a teen.

Surprisingly moving, in the second half anyway. The prose is flat, economical, and repetitive (for instance, <i>every</i> time the characters do <a href=""http://blogs.esa.int/alexander-gerst/2014/10/07/how-to-get-rid-of-nitrogen/"">pre-emptive oxygen saturation</a> before a spacewalk, Suarez tells you so), but if you like space or engineering detail you'll be fine. It's billed as (very) hard scifi, but there was actually less physics and more economics in it than I was expecting (and still too much kinematic exposition for most readers, I guess). It's ""hard"" in the sense that every technology in this already exists in some form, if only prototype or protoprototype, that every celestial body mentioned exists in that location, that the energy budget of the crew is taken seriously - ""gravity wells are for suckers"" - that their (even safety-critical) software has many terrible bugs. <spoiler>(Though I thought this was implausible:<br/><blockquote><i>The flight suits were meant only for short, emergency EVAs, but without access to the ship's network, the clam suits' high-tech helmets were inert.<br/></blockquote></i>)<br/>Why not completely local processing? Why not use the lo-tech visor instead?</spoiler><br/><br/>The most moving part was <spoiler>Nicole's euthanasia scene, though the anguish of Goff's stupid robots and extortion is also quite big</spoiler>. Some of the most important things in the world rely on sacrifice, and really we should be more moved by the death of an asteroid miner than that of a soldier in a typical war. One is driving the species forward, one is crab-wrestling in a bucket. <br/><br/>Why is space so moving? Well there's the stated reason, via Hawking:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>With climate change, overdue asteroid strikes, epidemics, and population growth, our own planet is increasingly precarious.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>But does this argument from reduction of existential risk go through? Probably not - most x-risk is due to us, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCfLheUxHEI"">not volcanoes or asteroids or gamma bursts</a>, and we should expect this kind of risk to reduce only modestly in a multiplanetary setting, since the act of colonisation carries the risk source, us, with it; and there are much cheaper and more developed ways of preventing extinction, like arms control and AI research. And we're (even) more likely to have large conflicts when the cultural distances, between planetary civilisations, are so much larger. <br/><br/>So what? Is it our genes, new-pastures wanderlust? The sheer scale? <br/><br/>There's a lot of ostentation in the book, unnecessary mentions of Zegna suits and fancy watches and whatnot (perhaps intended to make us suspicious of the investors and lawyers who wear them - but we already have them <i>admitting</i> that they are motivated by egomania and envy). The billionaire at the heart of the plot is a suitable mix of inspirational, reckless, authoritarian, noble, ignoble. <br/><br/>Props to Suarez for using <a href=""http://spaceengine.org/"">SpaceEngine</a> and <a href=""https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/"">Kerbal</a> to model the precise trajectory of his crew, though many extra points would have accrued had he open-sourced the run, for the purposes of scientific hermeneutics. Also for his bibliography and dissing <a href=""https://www.space.com/21554-mars-toxic-perchlorate-chemicals.html"">Mars colonisation</a>. <br/><br/>Suarez' claim that a single asteroid trip could make a trillion dollars is contradicted in <a href=""http://www.weeklyweinersmith.com/?p=858"">the Weinersmith's pop book</a>, where they emphasise the legal headaches, and that the profits are conditional on a huge increase in human space activity (otherwise not much demand for your LEO wares). This is all I know, and it's not very strong evidence either way.<br/><br/><br/>*********************************<br/><br/>How does it do as Serious science fiction?<br/><br/><i>Social development</i>: None. One thing which doesn't happen much IRL is the <spoiler>financial <i>and</i> literal suicide mission by a billionaire for the purposes of driving humanity forward</spoiler>, but this is just ordinary audacity scaled up. I like the extrapolation of <a href=""https://space-agency.public.lu/en.html"">Luxembourg</a>'s space industry, the ultimate colonial underwriting. The secret construction of a spaceship in HEO is implausible at the moment but <i>might</i> not be in a few decades.<br/><br/><i>Software development</i>: Yes! The mission is almost lost several times due to software problems, and Ade is the most critical crewmember because of his top monkeypatching and hacking skills (hacking in both senses).<br/><br/><i>Actual science</i>: Yes. The gravity ship is actually basic physics, just incredibly hard and expensive engineering (Joyce drops something like $45bn on the project, which sounds about right).

There is: a lot of rambling, a lot of meanness (breakups, fights, conversations that would be much healthier if they were honest fights), and then a transcendent or transcendently degraded last line. It would almost be not worth reading if you lost all the last lines. Here's what I mean by a pun - from 'The Calm':<br/><blockquote><i>But today I was thinking of that place, of Crescent City, and of how I was trying out a new life there with my wife, and how, in the barber's chair that morning, I had made up my mind to go. I was thinking today about the calm I felt when I closed my eyes and let the barber's fingers move through my hair, the sweetness of those fingers, the hair already starting to grow.<br/></blockquote></i>I expected him to care for his wretches.<br/><br/>The one from the wife's perspective, 'So Much Water So Close To Home' is the only standout. Completely menacing with almost no action, no flash. Good portraits of the oafish, as opposed to the rapey, as opposed to the long-suffering. I can't decide if the last line is acquiescence or perversity.<br/><br/>The title story is surprisingly slight, a 16-page Symposium with oddly inarticulate, repetitive drinkers. (One has ~10 years of college education, and but he's the most primitive.) You could put this down to naturalism and forget it entirely, but for its two great lines. (The story is, then, a fine thing for the protagonist of <i><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanleaf/2015/01/04/how-birdman-betrays-raymond-carver-an-untold-story/#64e140ac742c"">Birdman</a></i> to stage - self-defeating, opaque, not as deep as it wants.)<br/><br/>Stories like these live or die on dialogue, and there's neither enough heft or polish in their chat for me. I always get <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2426881729"">Chandler</a> and Carver mixed up (yeah, I know) - but if I didn't, I'd go for Chandler every time.

(It also has the most important part of self-help, an awareness that positive advice is never universal: ""<i>remember the law of equal and opposite advice. For every piece of advice useful to one person, there is some other person who needs exactly the opposite advice.</i>"") <br/><br/>(I put off reading this for a whole year, and felt bad about it. So.)<br/><br/>He'd have you move from external motivation to intrinsic motivation because it's more sustainable, and so more effective. He's quite radical about this, ditching normal moral psychology:<br/><blockquote><i>the way that most people use the word ""should,"" most of the time, is harmful. People seem to use it to put themselves in direct and unnecessary conflict with themselves... imagine the person who wakes up feeling a bit sick. They say to themselves, ""ugh, I should go to the pharmacy and pick up medication before work."" Now picking up meds feels like an obligation: if they don't get meds, then that's a little bit of evidence that they're incompetent, or akrasiatic, or bad... this disconnects the reason from the task, it abolishes the ""why"". The person feeling sick now feels like they have an obligation to pick up medication, and so if they do it, they do it grudgingly, resenting the situation... Now imagine they say this, instead: ""ugh, if I went to the pharmacy to pick up medication, I'd feel better at work today.""</blockquote></i> <br/><blockquote><i>Your true shoulds, if I could show them to you, would not look like a list of obligations. Your true shoulds would look like a recipe for building a utopia.</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>Many treat their moral impulses as a burden. But I say, find all the parts that feel like a burden, and drop them. Keep only the things that fill you with resolve, the things you would risk life and limb to defend.</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>I find it amusing that ""we need lies because we can't bear the truth"" is such a common refrain, given how much of my drive stems from my response to attempting to bear the truth.</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>""Badness"" is not a fundamental property that a person can have. At best, ""they're bad"" can be shorthand for either ""I don't want their goals achieved"" or ""they are untrained in a number of skills which would be relevant to the present situation""; but in all cases, ""they are bad"" must be either shorthand or nonsense.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>Wouldn't Nietzsche in his better moods (or Laozi at any time) smile?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The strategy is roughly:<br/><br/>1. Find something to care about. (Obstacles: hiding in bed, defensive relativism or nihilism, hiding in routine.)<br/>2. Drop all obligations and see what you still care about.<br/>3. Build intrinsic drive (change environment, train willpower and habit)<br/>4. Draw on the fact that the world is broken as fuel <br/>5. See guilt as an alien concept, unnecessary for the higher goals.<br/><br/>An important distinction:<br/><br/>* <i>Listless guilt</i>: feeling bad because you feel you should do something with your life, but not really thinking about what.<br/>* <i>Specific guilt</i>: feeling bad because of unmet obligations to a particular goal.<br/>* <i>Akrasia guilt</i>: feeling bad because you're not following the endorsed plan.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>One startling bit: some people report that following his advice has ""broken"" them, in the sense that guilt was indeed propping up their lives. His response is, ""good"":<br/><blockquote><i>Some people, when they stop forcing themselves to do things because they ""should,"" will do a bit less to improve the world. They'll bow a bit less to social pressure, and insofar as the social pressure was pushing them to do what you think is good, you might count that as a loss. Some people don't care about things larger than themselves, and that's perfectly fine, and making them more resilient to social pressure might lose the world some charity.<br/><br/>I expect that far more charity is lost from people convincing themselves that their altruistic desires are external obligations and resenting them. I expect that most people who feel obligated to improve the world and only do it because they ""should"" will become much more effective if they stop forcing themselves...<br/><br/>You can recover from breaking a few parts of yourself, so long as you're modular rather than fragile. <br/></blockquote></i><br/>(This attitude is <i>strongly</i> reminiscent of the person Scott Alexander is incredulous about at the end of <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/16/fear-and-loathing-at-effective-altruism-global-2017/"">this great, great piece</a>, though with instrumental harm.)<br/><br/>I'd probably be more cautious, and advise you not to read this if you don't have lots of <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/"">slack</a>, support, and stomach for <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/see-the-dark-world/"">horrible facts</a>. (Soares finds intrinsic motivation in attending to how awful the world is, how much it needs fixing.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>It's short but dense with interesting ideas. (e.g. the nice concise <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/the-stamp-collector/"">rebuttal of naive internalist egoism.</a>)<br/><br/>Each post repeats its point at least three times, which I suppose is intentional pedagogy, but it made me skim a lot. Soares also often links forward to posts you haven't read yet, confusingly.<br/><br/>I'm not particularly guilt-ridden or scrupulous, on <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/books/review-strangers-drowning-examines-extreme-do-gooders.html"">the scale of things</a>, but I still found this good. Not sure I buy everything in it, but the rough method (move from vague to specific guilt, and then view the specific guilt as an external and unhelpful force in the light of your specific goal) seems sensible.<br/><br/>If the following worldview or prose doesn't appeal to you, it's not for you:<br/><blockquote><i> you will not be measured by the number of moments in which you worked as hard as you could. You will not be judged by someone rooting around in your mind to see whether you were good or bad. You will not be evaluated according to how unassailable your explanations are, for why things you couldn't possibly have prevented were the things that went wrong.<br/><br/>You will be measured only by what actually happens... this is the driver that takes the place of guilt... All we need to do, in any given moment, is look upon the actions available to us and take whichever one seems most likely to lead to a future full of light.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>Why should we listen to self-help, unless the author has done something impressive?

Actually a unification of economics, political science, and this <i>other thing</i>. <br/><br/>The prose is deceptively plain, like say Anscombe. There's basically no data, it's all intuition pumps. (But I share most of his intuitions, which surprised me.)        <br/><br/>Some key premises:<br/>* Nonmarket forces matter.        <br/>* <i>Dissent helps us.</i> It is extremely rich data for anyone who cares about doing good work, and so lasting.        <br/>* If there were only rational (critical and disloyal) customers, the economy would collapse.        <br/>* Exit (market pressure) and Voice (nonmarket pressure). <br/>* (TODO (...) )<br/><br/>I've never seen such a clear analysis of nonmarket forces - and since I find them ugly and hopeless traps for activists, it's good to be challenged.        <br/><br/>He cracks open a massive neglected topic: we had studied <i>macroeconomic slack</i> (depressions, where your whole system is suddenly sluggish and unresponsive) extensively, but not microeconomic slack - Why don't firms maximise output, in healthy macro regimes? Because they're made of individuals who don't? Because of internal conflict requiring suboptimal compromises? Because it serves a latent function?        <br/><br/>There's also a surprising focus on social / personal decay - the idea that our new productive power allows for an unprecedented range of decadence, failures, mutation load... There's certainly <a href=""https://www.nasdaq.com/article/generational-wealth-why-do-70-of-families-lose-their-wealth-in-the-2nd-generation-cm1039671"">some evidence for that</a>. But also selection-as-repair and post-traumatic growth:<br/><blockquote><i>        Firms and other organisations are conceived to be permanently and randomly subjected to decline and decay. This radical pessimism, which views decay as an ever-present force constantly on the attack, generates its own cure; for as long as decay is hardly in undisputed command at all times, it is likely that the very process of decline activates certain counter-forces.        <br/></blockquote></i><br/>Read it slowly. I found it really clear, but I don't know if that's because I'm already fairly grounded in economics.        <br/><br/>He has a touching pride in political science, in a 1950s Apollonian way, and much of this criticises economists' costly bias in favour of exit:<br/><blockquote><i>   I hope to demonstrate to political scientists the usefulness of economic concepts </i>and to economists the usefulness of political concepts<i>. This reciprocity has been lacking in recent interdisciplinary work as economists have claimed that the concepts developed for the purpose of analyzing phenomena of scarcity and resource allocation can be successfully used for explaining political phenomena as diverse as power, democracy and nationalism. They have thus succeeded in occupying large portions of the neighbouring discipline.</blockquote></i><br/>Has the field since done much to vindicate this pride?<br/><br/>The best argument against Exit, which I usually favour, is that it <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZQG9cwKbct2LtmL3p/evaporative-cooling-of-group-beliefs"">speeds up and deepens</a> a group's decay: the people who get sick of drama and then leave are likely to be the more thoughtful and virtuous. <br/><br/>Worth serious study, but if all you take from this review is taking both market and nonmarket forces seriously, and thinking about when to use each, then it's still likely to be some help.",,,0,0

(Before, I'd been calling it <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist"">slingshot</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia"">akrasia</a>.) <br/><br/>Structured procrastination is that staple from stand-up comedy where the best way to get yourself to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mktCdixReBA"">tidy your entire house</a> is to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILysMhm8lXs"">sit down to do your taxes</a>.<br/><br/>: All of my reviews, all of my <a href=""https://www.gleech.org/"">essays</a> were written in the glow and shadow of other things I should've been doing.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>All procrastinators put off things they have to do. Structured procrastination is the art of making this bad trait work for you. The key idea is that procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely nothing. Procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing; they do marginally useful things, such as gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they find the time. Why does the procrastinator do these things? Because accomplishing these tasks is a way of not doing something more important.<br/><br/>        If all the procrastinator had left to do was to sharpen some pencils, no force on earth could get him to do it. However, the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult, timely, and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important...<br/><br/>        Doing those tasks becomes a way of not doing the things higher on the list. With this sort of appropriate task structure, you can become a useful citizen. Indeed, the procrastinator can even acquire, as I have, a reputation for getting a lot done.<br/><br/>        Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack. They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. But this approach ignores the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation. The few tasks on his list will be, by definition, the most important. And the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is the way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being...<br/><br/>        The second step in the art of structured procrastination is to pick the right sorts of projects for the top of the list. The ideal projects have two characteristics -- they seem to have clear deadlines (but really don't), and they seem awfully important (but really aren't). Luckily, life abounds with such tasks. At universities, the vast majority of tasks fall into those two categories, and I'm sure the same is true for most other institutions...<br/><br/>        At this point, the observant reader may feel that structured procrastination requires a certain amount of self-deception, since one is, in effect, constantly perpetrating a pyramid scheme on oneself. Exactly... what could be more noble than using one character flaw to offset the effects of another? <br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Work and study <i>pressurise</i> my life. They give me a structure to defy, a gravity assist. I am happiest laden with obligations, when the set of tasks that is my life flies just out of control. I think the mechanism is this: <br/><br/>  1. I require a steady stream of variety. <br/>  2. Having a job makes my days closely resemble each other. <br/>  3. Intolerable resentment. <br/>  I am forced to produce creative sparks to satisfy my basic drive. <br/><br/>SP is related to how great I feel when I don't have to go to a party, to my sadly efficient approach to grades, to how giving work to a busy person is a good way of getting it done quicker, i.e. an implausible linear increase of output with increasing things to do. I read more fiction when doing a stats degree and learn more stats when in work.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>Antecedents of Perry and me.</b><br/><br/>Fernando Pessoa: <blockquote><i>        I often wonder what kind of person I would be if I had been protected from the cold wind of fate by the screen of wealth... to reach the tawdry heights of being a good assistant book-keeper in a job that is about as demanding as an afternoon nap and offers a salary that gives me just enough to live on.<br/>        I know that, had that past existed, I would not now be capable of writing these pages, which, though few, I would undoubtedly have only day-dreamed, given more comfortable circumstances. For banality is a form of intelligence, and reality, especially if it is brutish and rough, forms a natural complement to the soul. Much of what I feel and think I owe to my work as a book-keeper since the former exists as a negation of and flight from the latter. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Nietzsche: <blockquote><i>        the struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity... produced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely-strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals... we have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow! And perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and, who knows? The goal to aim at... <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Geoff Dyer:<blockquote><i>        The best circumstance for writing, I realized... were those in which the world was constantly knocking at your door; in such circumstances, the work you were engaged in generated a kind of pressure, a force to keep the world at bay. Whereas here, on Alonissos, there was nothing to keep at bay, there was no incentive to generate any pressure within the work, and so the surrounding emptiness invaded and dissipated, overwhelmed you with inertia. All you could do was look at the sea and the sky and after a couple of days you could scarcely be bothered to do that.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Zach Weiner: <blockquote><i>        [After months of working only on my main goal] I took on a job doing closed captioning because I found it [made for] an easier time writing. Just something about talking to people and watching weird media made the writing a lot easier. My new theory of self was that you can't write well unless you have a little strife in your life. I worked at the closed captioning job for 4-6 months and by then I was making enough money on the site to responsibly quit my job.<br/><br/>        The problem was I didn't want to quit my job and have readership fall off because I couldn't write, so my crazy idea was to go back to school. I thought, it'd to be this weird environment, with younger people, and that would be good...<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Is this platitudinous? It is possible that the grand narration above is delusional, and that the only actual content here is ""A lot of people work better under pressure"". Don't think so though.<br/><br/>YMMV. 5/5 if you don't do this already.",,,1,0

He is <i>much</i> more empathetic with bad philosophy that I am; he builds people very different from himself or me (a worried father writing a moral-panic piece about perfect recall; a young-earth creationist tipped into despair by being god's practice shot), and then around page 10 he flips their philosophy, showing how it unravels in the face of reality, and so makes me look like an idiot zealot for being irritated by them.<br/><blockquote><i>many people became convinced that </i>[alt-timeline creation devices]<i> nullified the moral weight of their actions.

I suppose it is actually quite vigorous and irreverent, coming from an organisation man:<br/><blockquote><i>study can be a substitute for productive work</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>   Darwin considered himself to be a geologist, but the world remembers largely his biology. Should Goethe be in the literature, biology, physics, or philosophy department? He actually was most proud of his work on optics, though that work was largely flawed. Would Newton or Fisher find comfortable academic niches today?</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>    All graduate students are taught that it is essential to become an expert. As a short-term goal this is, of course, valid. Academic search committees are also looking for experts. As a lifestyle, however, becoming an expert can inhibit creativity... As one becomes more of an expert, a larger and more complex network of facts and explanations accumulates and solidifies, making it difficult to entertain radical alternative ideas or to recognize new problems... An Aristotle or Freud may create a set of bars within which most people pace rigidly, never noticing clues from outside the cage</blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>    it is much more likely that one can work at 100% mental clarity for about four hours. If one keeps this in mind, then a distinction can be made between critical issues that need full clarity and intense effort, which become part of the four hours of work per day, and those parts of a project that are routine and become part of the rest of the day... returning calls, coding a clearly designed subroutine, ordering equipment, attending seminars, editing reports, etc</blockquote></i><br/><br/>But these are the only interesting bits in 300 pages. This is true but the book doesn't help much:<br/><blockquote><i> scientists are largely uncoached and are rarely introspective. They spend a lot of<br/>time studying their disciplinary subject matter, but almost no time learning strategies of problem solving</blockquote></i><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>* He gives examples from <i>many</i> different domains (ecology, epidemiology, physics, hardware), but so I spotted some errors.<br/>* A new record! Loehle cites a crashing falsehood on p.2, and several times elsewhere: Gardner's DOA <a href=""https://researched.org.uk/myth-busting-gardners-multiple-intelligences/"">theory of multiple intelligences</a>. And he naively teases out the strategic implications. He harps on this theme repeatedly - e.g. this is also flatly false: <i>above a certain minimal level, IQ and college grades are not predictive of <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c6ef/f99ef5b7423b882b2e34034f910508fc50c6.pdf"">productivity</a>, <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2007-strenze.pdf"">success</a>, or <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-IQ-of-Nobel-Laureates"">innovation</a></i>.<br/>* He tries to talk about software but is stuck in the 90s. He has no sense of open-sourcing software as the most successful strategy (witness <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost#Awards"">XGB</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras#Traction"">Chollet</a>).<br/>* It tries to also appeal to business people, for some reason. Half the examples and advice are about corporate decisionmaking (<i>The proper focus or perspective is essential when looking at business performance.</i>) This is distracting and makes it feel generic, belies the title.<br/>* His ""new model of the scientific method"" is vague and doesn't deserve the word.<br/>* The chapter on social distortions (credit stealing, cherry-picking, trends and irrational effects of publication timing) is ok, just ahead of the Replication crisis curve.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Anyway: as a scientist you <i>want</i> problems. But not just any problem - something that both doesn't fit, & has important implications. Advice I read in this, or read into it:  <br/><br/>* A theory can be inconsistent or incomplete: one generate contradiction, the other keeps explanations weak.<br/>* Paradoxes are shortcuts to the frontier. Look for heated debates and find a synthesis / circumvention.

The psychological side - the panic, narrow focus, and sense of doom - was completely absent from my economics classes, but without it you can't really understand poverty, and thus can't value economic growth as the life-saving, mind-saving thing it has been. <br/><br/>Reasons scarcity is bad:<br/>1. Lower consumption is less good (and sometimes very bad)<br/>2. Less freedom (fewer choices)<br/>3. Anxiety (emotional penalty)<br/>4. Cognitive penalty (bandwidth of worrying)<br/>5. Excessive focus on present, no planning, compromising future (""tunnelling"")<br/>6. Have to spend time on careful allocation (""juggling"")<br/>7. Excess self-consciousness means worse performance (""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choke_(sports)"">choking</a>"")<br/>8. It might also poison social interaction by <a href=""https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bfriedman/files/the_moral_consequences_of_economic_growth_0.pdf"">encouraging</a> <a href=""http://www.nonzero.org/app1.htm"">zero-sum thinking</a> and its attendent wasteful conflict. (Although see <a href=""http://www.sebastianjunger.com/tribe-by-sebastian-junger"">Junger</a> for some positive social effects of shared adversity.)<br/>9. It recurses: Mistakes lead to real sacrifice (debt; traps; no slack means penalties bite, further reducing slack). Scarcity causes more scarcity by screwing with your planning and implementation skills.<br/><br/>Economics only really handles costs (1) and (2). Psychology at its best handles (3-7). (9) is the author's new contribution, I think: this is cognitive economics.<br/><br/>    Without <a href=""https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/"">some spare resources</a> it's impossible to be free, to be generous, to relax. That's obvious. Less obvious: Without slack you can't even think straight (there's a ""bandwidth tax"" on the poor, reducing their effective intelligence, willpower by perhaps an entire standard deviation). Most of the cited experiments are about money scarcity, but their ingenious move is to generalise to all of us, to all conditions where a person lacks some instinctively (evolutionarily) key resource: e.g. money, time, calories, friends. As well as a rare theoretical synthesis, this makes this book more evocative for its rich-world readers:<br/><blockquote><i>We have used the psychology of scarcity to create an empathy bridge. We have used experience with one form of scarcity (say, time) to connect to another form (money). Having known what it’s like to badly need a little more time, we might start to imagine what it’s like to desperately need a little more money or even more friends. We used this bridge to draw a connection between a busy manager fretting about insufficient time before a deadline and a person short on cash fretting about insufficient funds to pay rent.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Exciting! I've been reading development economics and behavioural science for years, and I still got a lot of new results and a whole gosh-darnit Practical Theory of Mind with moving parts from this. <br/><br/>They compress all the complex constructs and determinants of their real theory into a lossy construct, ""bandwidth"". This is a shorthand for working memory <i>&</i> fluid intelligence <i>&</i> attention span <i>&</i> decision consistency <i>&</i> persistence <i>&</i> executive control <i>&</i> long-term planning inclination. They admit at the start it's a compression, so that's fine.<br/><blockquote><i>With compromised bandwidth, we are more likely to give in to our impulses, more likely to cave in to temptations. With little slack, we have less room to fail. With compromised bandwidth, we are more likely to fail.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Lesson: To actually optimise your life, you can't optimise too hard, in the sense of pushing right up against your budgets. This idea is not new; a different book would tie this to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little's_law"">queuing theory</a> and distributed systems, trying to find general theoretical truths about systems. (What's the maximum sustainable load for a server? For a life?) Excess capacity, 'slack', is short-run inefficiency <i>and</i> long-term shock-tolerance and thus <a href=""https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00229?gko=a073f"">true efficiency</a>. The point seems to apply to servers, hospitals, and a single human life viewed from inside.<br/><br/>This also adds to Taleb's critique of naive finance, encouraging 'risk-sensitive optimisation' (or, death-sensitive).  Extends bounded rationality to limited attention, willpower, as well as computation and a search budget.<br/><br/>The book's big philosophical question is the old Essence vs Context chestnut (""the poor are worse parents, drivers, borrowers"" vs ""given these constraints, people are worse parents, drivers, borrowers""). But it's a new twist on it: rather than (as well as) a developmental deficiency, poverty is an active, situational force: <br/><blockquote><i>This shortfall is not of the standard physiological variety, having to do with a lack of nutrition or stress from early childhood hindering brain development. Nor is bandwidth permanently compromised by poverty. It is the present-day cognitive load of making ends meet: when income rises, so, too, does cognitive capacity. The bandwidth of the farmers was restored as soon as crop payments were received. Poverty at its very core taxes bandwidth and diminishes capacity.</blockquote></i><br/>This surprises me: I generally accept that people are <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/docs/sociology/1987-rossi"">hard to change</a>, that engineered context is relatively weak. But then all attempts at self-improvement are a denial of essentialism about <i>something</i>, and I'm well into those.<br/><blockquote><i>To explain why the poor borrow excessively, we do not need to appeal to a lack of financial education, the avarice of predatory lenders, or an oversized tendency for self-indulgence. To explain why the busy put off things and fall behind, we do not need to appeal to weak self-control, deficient understanding, or a lack of time-management skills. Instead, borrowing is a simple consequence of tunneling.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>They don't sugarcoat it: they accept the massive body of evidence on how burdened the poor are, on dozens of axes. And they note that just giving them cash rarely solves the problem because this doesn't change the logic enough.<br/><blockquote><i>The poor stay poor, the lonely stay lonely, the busy stay busy, and diets fail.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>One big gripe: They use the word ""scarcity"" for both a physical shortage (i.e. the normal economic sense) and for this special psychological burden. (Not having, and having your mind captured by not having.) This needs two words; it muddies their thesis.<br/><br/>They've persuaded me that late fines are an extremely regressive tax. I'm open to the view that reducing poor people's options is sometimes best for them (e.g. if they are ""<i>hurt by the ability to borrow</i> [at extortionate rates]"" because it prevents them smoothing their income in a credit cycle). I agree that bandwidth is the deepest kind of human capital. <br/><br/>Their treatment of the mental costs of education is important, given NGOs' blithe promotion of education over all else. (And it's a further argument for unconditional cash transfers.) <br/><blockquote><i>To capitalize on a bonus payment for a child’s medical checkup, a parent must set up the appointment, remember to keep it, find the time to get there and back, and coerce the child to go (no child likes the doctor!). Each of these steps requires some bandwidth. And this is just one behavior. Conditional cash transfer programs seek to encourage dozens, if not hundreds, of these good behaviors. Just understanding those incentives and making the necessary trade-offs—deciding which are worth it for you and which are not, and when—requires bandwidth.<br/><br/>We never ask, Is this how we want poor people to use their bandwidth? We never factor in this cost in deciding which behaviors are most worth promoting. When we design poverty programs, we recognize that the poor are short on cash, so we are careful to conserve on that. But we do not think of bandwidth as being scarce as well. Nowhere is this clearer than in our impulse to educate.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>    <br/>I'm a keen and cynical student of social research, and but I only recognised one spurious result in this whole book. (ego depletion, p.107 - and that only in a tangent explicitly phrased as hypothetical.)  They did a pretty convincing within-subjects study on sugar farmers before and after harvest income which nails down the effect as far as I can see.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Only not five stars because we can't give any social science book five stars until it is 20 years old and more severely scrutinised.",,,1,0

(Returning logic to its normative roots.) But Kowalski immediately strays from this to <i>also</i> try to build ""<i>a comprehensive, logic-based theory of human intelligence</i>"". By aiming at both pragmatic self-help and grand, metaphysical, qualitative psychology, it's too ambitious - or rather, appropriately ambitious but using the wrong tools. <br/><br/>(The right tools are unknown but probably include decision theory, statistics, distributed representations, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function"">Bayesian</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding"">predictive</a> brain - none of which Kowalski foregrounds. He talks about inferring causes - without using Causal Inference; about doing abduction - without probabilities; about production systems - without the more mature Predictive Processing calculus.)<br/> <br/>Kowalski praises a few bad theories, like Fodor's version of language of thought, and Gardner's multiple intelligences. (And Cyc isn't marked as a failure.) But also good theories: dual-process psychology, Sperber's relevance theory.<br/><br/>The best bit is where he links cognitive biases to naive logical rules<br/><blockquote><i>The computational interpretation [of dual process theory] is that, when an agent is deliberative, its behaviour is controlled by a high-level program, which manipulates symbols that have meaningful interpretations in the environment. But when the agent is intuitive, its behaviour is generated by a low-level program or physical device... <br/><br/>        The logical interpretation of dual process theories is that, when an agent is deliberative, its behaviour is generated by reasoning with high-level goals and beliefs. When the agent is intuitive, its behaviour is determined by low-level input–output associations, even if these associations can also be represented in logical form.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>    It's also a friendly introduction to more recent logics. Perhaps too friendly - if you think that formal symbols always make things harder to think about, I recommend comparing learning logic from this vs a good semiformal text like <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1638937.Logic"">Tomassi</a>. The bloat of English compared to symbols is about 20x, and the overheads are impossible to miss.<br/><br/>It is at least what I hoped it would be: a very clear introduction to good old ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence"">GOFAI</a>"" in all its rigour, grandiosity and narrowness. (There are maybe 600 definitions in this.)  I wanted a logician's (or logic programmer's) view on AI, and I got it (from the technical appendices). CL is impressive and authoritative on a small number of tasks, but it's just not generally promising, and hasn't been for a long time. This 2011 book read like a time capsule from the 1970s, before Prolog and Cyc had soured, before the Winter. (I should clarify that inductive logic programming <a href=""https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11172"">is a live research programme</a> - I'm going to work on it myself - but <i>only</i> in combination with the ruling statistical methods.) I actually don't understand how he can think that this approach is the answer - is it unkind to put it down to decades of sunk cost?<br/><br/>    I also thought it might be a more rigorous version of <i>Algorithms to Live By</i>, and I suppose it is, but at the cost of its practicality.",,,1,0

It is also likely that there are considerations of critical importance that I fail to take into account, thereby invalidating some or all of my conclusions. I have gone to some length to indicate nuances and degrees of uncertainty throughout the text — encumbering it with an unsightly smudge of “possibly,” “might,” “may,” “could well,” “it seems,” “probably,” “very likely,” “almost certainly.” Each qualifier has been placed where it is carefully and deliberately. Yet these topical applications of epistemic modesty are not enough; they must be supplemented here by a systemic admission of uncertainty and fallibility. This is not false modesty: for while I believe that my book is likely to be seriously wrong and misleading, I think that the alternative views that have been presented in the literature are substantially worse - including the default view, according to which we can for the time being reasonably ignore the prospect of superintelligence.</i></blockquote> <br/>Bostrom introduces <a href=""http://aiimpacts.org/ai-risk-terminology/"">dozens of neologisms</a> and many arguments. Here is the main scary apriori one though:<br/><blockquote><br/>1. Just being intelligent doesn't imply being benign; intelligence and goals can be independent. (<i>the orthogonality thesis</i>.)<br/>2. Any agent which seeks resources and lacks explicit moral programming would default to dangerous behaviour. You are made of things it can use; <i>hate</i> is superfluous. (<i>Instrumental convergence</i>.) <br/>3. It is conceivable that AIs might gain capability very rapidly through recursive self-improvement. (<i>Non-negligible possibility of a hard takeoff.</i>)<br/>4. Since AIs will not be automatically nice, would by default do harmful things, and could obtain a lot of power very quickly*, AI safety is morally significant, deserving public funding, serious research, and international scrutiny.<br/></blockquote><br/>Of far broader interest than its title (and that argument) might suggest to you. In particular, it is the best introduction I've seen to the new, shining <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory"">decision sciences</a> - an undervalued reinterpretation of old, vague ideas which, until recently, you only got to see if you read statistics, <i>and</i> economics, <i>and</i> the crunchier side of psychology. It is also a history of humanity, a thoughtful treatment of psychometrics v genetics, and a rare objective estimate of the worth of large organisations, past and future.<br/><br/><i>Superintelligence</i>'s main purpose is moral: he wants us to worry and act urgently about hypotheticals; given this rhetorical burden, his tone too is a triumph. <br/><blockquote><i>For a child with an undetonated bomb in its hands, a sensible thing to do would be to put it down gently, quickly back out of the room, and contact the nearest adult. Yet what we have here is not one child but many, each with access to an independent trigger mechanism. The chances that we will all find the sense to put down the dangerous stuff seem almost negligible. Some little idiot is bound to press the ignite button just to see what happens. Nor can we attain safety by running away, for the blast of an intelligence explosion would bring down the firmament. Nor is there a grown-up in sight... <br/><br/>This is not a prescription of fanaticism. The intelligence explosion might still be many decades off in the future. Moreover, the challenge we face is, in part, to hold on to our humanity: to maintain our groundedness, common sense, and goodhumored decency even in the teeth of this most unnatural and inhuman problem. We need to bring all human resourcefulness to bear on its solution. <br/></i></blockquote><br/>I don't donate to AI safety orgs, despite caring about the best way to improve the world and despite having no argument against it better than ""that's not how software has worked so far"" and despite the <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/22/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk/"">concern of smart experts</a>.

(The Questions are ‘<i>How come existence</i>?’, ‘<i>Why the quantum</i>?’, ‘<i>It from bit?</i>’, ‘<i>What makes meaning?</i>’) <br/><br/>Which wasn't what I was expecting from an out-of-print hardback tome by a serious physicist - particularly with that grand title - but still: nice. In fact it's hard to imagine anyone writing out these first steps any friendlier (ok, maybe <a href=""https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/"">Ben Orlin</a>). Its technical work feels effortless; think Schroedinger's <i><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life%3F"">What is Life?</a></i> (which von Baeyer actually corrects, in passing).<br/><br/>I needed a book on the method / meta-field surrounding mathematical ""information"", because it has surrounded me: it threatens to encompass science. Just as ""energy"" eventually became a unifying pillar of all the natural sciences, information has infiltrated that same salient: <br/><br/>Energy <-> Entropy <-> Information. <br/><br/>And then into other sciences: vB hints that we should see bits as money as ML-performance as Fisher information as VNM utility, which would seize about half of theoretical science.<br/><br/>Info theory is a core part of a mathematico-philosophical witch's brew: computability, decision theory, <a href=""https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf"">computational complexity</a>, <a href=""http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/GaussianModel/JaynesProbabilityTheory.pdf"">Bayesian statistics</a>, digital physics, quantum computing. Which together take big steps towards the naturalisation of logic - or, more, of maths - or more, of thought. (And is information larger than thought?) And/or the dematerialisation of physics?<br/><br/>von Baeyer builds it all up, so we get Clausius (1852) for thermodynamics, Boltzmann (1877) for entropy (inverse info) as a proper physical object, Shannon (1930) for classical info theory, Solomonoff (1960) for algorithmic complexity, Landauer for the shocking physics of computation (1961), Bekenstein (1971) and Hawking for black hole theory (crucial experiments for it-from-bit), Deutsch (1985) for how quantum computing could work. And Wheeler setting the whole new agenda. (I call it new because it hasn't made it into undergraduate philosophy, or physics, or statistics, or ordinary computer science, yet.)<br/><br/>The philosophy is very well done. I really liked his physicist's optimism about reflective equilibrium between science and folk physics:<br/><blockquote><i>Information, too, has been defined operationally. Unfortunately, this technical, bottom-up definition is very restricted, and hitherto bears little resemblence to any of the common, top-down definitions. Eventually the two definitions should converge, but that hasn't happened yet. When it does, we will finally know what information is. <br/></blockquote></i><br/>It impresses me to find a pop science book that has aged this well, over 16 years. It's sad that that's impressive - obviously I'm not reading enough physics and maths. Von Baeyer maybe leans too hard on the physics-is-solid heuristic; he ends up being uncritical about some extremely late-breaking and radical work: the heterodox classical theory of <a href=""http://www.matheory.info/chapter1.html"">Kahre</a> (2002) and <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1018820410908"">Zeilinger's</a> (1999) grand quietist explanation for QM's weirdness (neither of which I've heard much about since). <br/><blockquote><i>Zeilinger's principle... furnishes an answer to Wheeler's famous question ""Why the quantum?"" Why does nature seems granular, discontinuous, quantized into discrete chunks like sand..? The answer is that while we have no idea how the world is really arranged, and shouldn't even ask, we </i>do<i> know that knowledge of the world is information: and since information is naturally quantized into bits, the world also appears quantized. If it didn't, we wouldn't be able to understand it. It's both as simple and as profound as that.<br/><br/>A second prediction of QM that is explained... is the randomness of the outcomes of some measurements... if the single bit of information in an elementary system is revealed, then there is no more information left over to answer additional experimental questions... so other independent measurements must have random answers.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Each chapter takes an idea (""heat and entropy"", ""logarithms and message space"", ""qubits"", ""Morse and optimality"") and builds it up with little informal proofs and thought experiments. This is nice, but because it has to do everything from scratch it's more of a grab-bag than an argument, and certainly not a ""language of science"" by the end. For instance, he stops short of one key philosophical outcome of all this technical talk, which is that there are two types of explanations, even though he covers all the ideas you'd need:<br/><br/>1) information compressions (e.g. General relativity explains the force on <i>all</i> of the infinite points in spacetime in one <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations#Mathematical_form"">unbelievably terse tensor equation</a>. We can often count the bits used by theories like this, and so solve theory selection!)<br/><br/>2) simplified algorithms, faster ways to reason about the world (e.g. much of computer science)<br/><br/>As you can tell from the number of question marks in this review, I found this stimulating but not conclusive. But it would be foolish to expect a pop book to answer the Really Big Questions, and von Baeyer's reminds us frequently that the current answers he presents are unfinished. So this is step one of a currently unbounded algorithm. Minus a half for not quite taking things as far as they can go.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><i>Misc notes</i><br/><br/>* This would be a pretty good primer for <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality"">Map and Territory</a> or <a href="""">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a>, if those assume too much for you.<br/><br/>* <i>Lots</i> of literary illustrations of scientific ideas - Calvino, Wittgenstein, Borges - but it didn't feel forced to me. I suppose it might actually reduce the friendliness, for some readers.<br/><br/>* Is this true?:<br/><blockquote><i>The most important role of noise, however, is as the preserver of our sanity. Without noise, the measurement or observation of a single quantity would requite an infinite memory and an infinite amount of time - it would overload all our circuits. Neither science nor consciousness could exist... noise is a thick blanket of snow which softens the contours into large, rounded mounds we can perceive and sort out without being overwhelmed.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>We evolved <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Gigerenzer#Heuristics"">lots of ways</a> to ignore information. Why would this not happen again? A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye#Early_eyes"">photosensitive patch</a> arises in that noiseless world; since it is an analogue processor it simply trims off the infinite information by default when it runs out of molecules or reactions(?)<br/><br/>* He calls the Bayesian interpretation of probability ""the rational approach"" which suits me but let's imagine that's a mistranslation of his meaning ""the mental approach"", ""the personalist approach"".<br/><br/><br/>* Gleick handles the social history and applications with unsurpassed skill, but I wanted the mind-bending crunchy side, <i>natural information</i>, digital physics, information as everything.<br/><br/>* ""Information is flow of form""<br/><br/>* <a href=""https://bethzero.com/2019/07/09/12-why-kolmogorov-complexity-is-useless/"">Solomonoff induction is intractable</a>, another word for practically useless. Does this change the philosophical significance of the above brew? I don't think so - ""Here is a way to work everything out; you can almost never use it"" is a pretty plausible way for philosophy to end tbf. Does it change its scientific significance? Yes, absolutely - we have to seek approximations of the forbidden ideal or else it has none.<br/><br/>* What's fundamental, thermodynamics or information? <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics"">Neither</a>?<br/><br/>* Yet another way that info theory eats the life of the mind is the deeply practical ""value of information"", a way of deciding whether to bother with an experiment (q.v. the master, <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xiojTDJP6FWdb2Fmb/value-of-information-8-examples"">Gwern</a>).",,,1,0

Or it could be I'm just not up to the mark intellectually, of course.<br/><br/>    JR: You have written quite a few novels that use Freudian imagery and tropes—The Wasp Factory, Use of Weapons, The Bridge, Walking on Glass—What do you think of Freudian psychoanalysis?<br/><br/>    IB: Never been entirely sold on it. I suspect Freud's theories tell you a great deal about Freud, quite a lot about the monied middle-class in Vienna a hundred-plus years ago, and only a little about people in general. Like Marx, he was too keen to insist that his area of study was genuinely a science. Also like Marx, though, he provides a genuinely useful and insightful (if, especially in Freud's case, limited) way of looking at people and their hidden lives (well, more implied lives with Marx, relating to their economic function within a society). Anyway, I can honestly say that I've never deliberately included any Freudian imagery in my stories, so what's there must be the result of my subconscious. . . . Uh-oh. . . <br/></blockquote>",,,1,0

The title alone beats most leftists and rightists, who tend to tacitly deny the existence of good or bad capitalisms, respectively. (Where by good we mean ""good for growth and eliminating poverty"".) The authors go further of course, with four ideal types:<br/><br/>* <i>state-guided capitalism</i> (China, 60s Japan, Singapore)<br/>* <i>big-firm capitalism</i> (South Korea, Japan, France, North Carolina)<br/>* <i>entrepreneurial capitalism</i> - high growth from small companies doing actually new things, high distribution of gains - (Ireland, UK, California)<br/>* <i>oligarchic capitalism</i> - low growth, low distribution of gains - (Russia, Italy, sometimes South Korea)<br/><br/>They tie these to specific policies, often lacking in these kinds of books. They also accept that what's ""good"" economic policy depends on your existing base (cf. Ha-Joon Chang's argument for trade barriers for pre-industrial countries). Most of the book is about the conditions and effects of entrepreneurship, but they also find big firms actually necessary (""<i>the best form of capitalism is a blend of entrepreneurial and big-firm</i>""), well before <a href=""https://read.macmillan.com/lp/big-business-by-tyler-cowen/"">Tyler Cowen</a>.<br/><br/>Decent paean to the moral importance of growth too:<br/><blockquote><i>slow growth, especially when coupled with widening inequality, can provide an environment that breeds distrust and often hate. It is not an accident that some of the worst periods of intolerance to African Americans and immigrants in United States history (the late 1800s, the 1930s, 1970s) occurred during periods of slow or negative growth. The worst-case example of this was, of course, the rise of Nazism...<br/><br/>Michael Mandel: 'Such technology-driven growth is essential if we are not to drown in our own problems... Without breakthroughs in medical science, it won't be possible to supply the healthh care to a generation of aging Americans without bankrupting the young. Without breakthroughs in energy production, it won't be possible to bring Third World economies up to industrialised living standards without badly damaging the environment...' <i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>If annual growth of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 100 years average<br/>labor productivity is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earnings will have risen<br><br/>2%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 620%<br/>3% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1820%<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Good book for anyone who thinks they hate economics, or economists, or neoclassical economics, or growth itself.

Some of that opinion is classist stereotype; it certainly wasn't true four hundred years ago (the devotional poems of <a href=""http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/conlee-dunbar-complete-works-poems-devotional-and-moral"">Dunbar</a> and Henryson stand up to the sacred efforts in any language); but most is real, down to Knox's decision on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Bible"">a legally-mandatory bible in English</a>, but even more to the cultural capture of the nation’s Anglicised elites, but even more than that to the simple dictates of shared economic activity, over three hundred years: i.e. <i>we gave</i> English our sacred talk, then we gave English our intellectual talk, and then trade talk, and law talk, and all their formal accoutrements. Until only the informal and proletarian was left. Atweill, the kitsch prevails (“Hoots ma wee bonnie lassie! Ahiiii wid wauk fyv hhundrid myles”).  When Lorimer wrote this, the dialectisation of Scots, and the cutesy granny-aff-a-bus process wasn’t so advanced - but this is the register we moderns read it in, unless we are rural and lucky.<br/><br/>(Nasty but probable thing I once heard a linguist lecture on: relatively few languages develop the scientific-philosophical register and benefit from its sharpening vocabularies. He reckoned that only nine ever have, <i>fully</i>: Chinese, Arabic, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Russian, German, French, English. Scots definitely had speakers sophisticated enough, in its High Medieval heyday, but the internationalist use of Latin precluded it.)<br/><br/>Lorimer saw a Bible translation as one of two conditions of revitalising braid Scots - the language, rather than the dialect Scots English. (The other big brick being <a href=""http://www.dsl.ac.uk/"">the Dictionary</a>.) Well, we have both now, and they are not enough. The argument for bringing back languages is only superficially humane, since language is for communication <i>first</i>, and our condition is more and more a global one. (I find it difficult to fault <a href=""http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/agreeable-ways-to-disable-your-children/"">Katja Grace’s analysis</a>: the standard arguments fail, the present matters more than the past: because it is where value happens.) <br/><br/>Lorimer translated it straight from the Koine Greek over a full decade, finishing the second draft just before his death. The art comes in his rendering the apostles with their own voice and distinctive idiolect. (Paul is, here as ever, a nasty little man: smug and litigious.) While I’m very glad this exists, the book itself can do little for me, whatever language it’s wearing. (Nothing takes me further from religious awe than the actual things we said God said.

It sounds misleadingly provincial to call such a quest “AI Alignment” ...<br/><br/>        There is no doubt something beautiful – and much raw intellectual appeal – in the quest for Alignment.  It includes, of necessity, some of the most mind-bending facets of both mathematics and philosophy, and what is more, it has an emotional poignancy and human resonance rarely so close to the surface in those rarefied subjects.

Whereas if the AI stuff really does happen, that's not the future they have... I can understand Bostrom's arguments that an intelligence explosion would completely transform the world; it's pointless speculating what a superintelligence would do, in the same way it would be stupid for a gorilla to wonder how humanity would change the world.<br/><br/>And I realised that this was what the instinctive 'yuck' was when I thought about the arguments for AI risk. 'I feel that parents should be able to advise their children,' I said. 'Anything involving AGI happening in their lifetime - I can't advise them on that future. I can't tell them how best to live their lives because I don't know what their lives will look like, or even if they'll be recognisable as human lives... I'm scared for my children.' And at this point I apologised, because I found that I was crying.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>(Amateur psychoanalysis is fine - if you're doing it to yourself, and if you don't take it too seriously.)<br/>        <br/>    I'm pretty sure I know who this is (that mix of iron scrupulousness and radical honesty) and before I read it I thought the same: <br/><blockquote><i>I met a senior Rationalist briefly in California, and he was extremely wary of me; he refused to go on the record.

He said he was worried that if too many people hear about AI risk, then it'll end up like IQ, the subject of endless angry political arguments that have little to do with the science, and that a gaggle of nerdy Californian white guys probably weren't the best advocates for it then.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>    Journalistic harm I feared, that didn't come to pass: he never comments on anyone's appearance (""<i>It would be extremely easy for me to write a book mocking them. But I don't want to do that.</i>""); he mentions Dylan Matthews' irritating amateur psychoanalysis only once - roughly, ""<i>of course Silicon Valley people think that good software will save the world</i>""; he gives exactly no time to that one proudly cruel subreddit devoted entirely to ad hominem idiocy about the Rats. He brings up polyamory a lot but not malignantly.<br/> <br/>        The ""<a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/16/cardiologists-and-chinese-robbers/"">Chinese robber fallacy</a>"" is that you can make any large group seem evil by selecting from bad actors among them, even if they have exactly the same rate of the selected bad behaviour.

This is enough to satisfy me that the 'dark side' (i.e. the odd far-rightist, and two gendered tragedies) Chivers covers is the selfsame dark side as our dumb world at large.<br/><br/>    I hate Chivers capitalising ""Rationalist"" all the time. I double hate it when he pairs this with capitalised 'Effective Altruist', like ""<i>the Rationalist Effective Altruist Buck Shlegeris</i>"". At no point does Chivers use the full (and only appropriate) name for the identity: ""<i>aspiring</i> rationalist"". (No human is that rational.)

But the big one is that, after talking to all these people for and against, Chivers <i>ends</i> with the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svoD5KLKHyAKEdwPo/against-modest-epistemology"">deferential</a> prior: <a href=""https://cdn.80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-02-17-at-6.53.52-pm.png"">80% of</a> technical researchers think it's 90% likely we'll have AGI within a century, and if (as Chivers thinks) 17% think it will be highly negative, then our best guess is a 14% chance of catastrophic AGI. (With <i>very</i> large error bars - but that's even worse when you think about it.) Now, since he began at extreme scepticism (<1%) this is a large update - and we were lucky that a journalist came this far out on the limb.

The main thesis is that debt isn't straightforward accounting: all systems of debt require a hidden moral assumption, which is that it's bad to be indebted, that debt overrules other moral claims like equity or even survival:<br/><blockquote><i>paying one’s debts is not the essence of morality, that all these things are human arrangements and that if democracy is to mean anything, it is the ability to all agree to arrange things in a different way.</blockquote></i><br/>To establish this he goes into an array of human economies: slaving, gift economies, Kula rings... but the brute fact of diverse institutions doesn't really connect with his moral thesis. <i>Then</i> this all goes towards his grand equating of the market and the state (so that people will resist both of them). <br/><br/>He argues that formal debt (of accountants and lawyers) causes poverty and violence relative to traditional informal debt (of cousins, dowries, and sheep). But this is wildly inconsistent with the last two hundred years of social development; poverty is a fraction of what it was, and violence (including state violence, including incarceration as violence) is also down.<br/><br/>He gets worked up about ""the myth of barter"", the largely silly idea that there was generally a transition from pure barter economies to money economies at some point in cultural history. Even if we grant this, his estimation of the significance of barter being rare is excessive. It doesn't have any clear moral bearing.<br/><br/>His debt Jubilee idea, coming as it did post-Recession, is superficially good, especially since giant financiers had just received trillions in bailouts. But if we made debt forgiveness a common concern, we'd just be redistributing money to those best at obtaining credit via excessive self-esteem, credentials or scamming. And post-Jubilee credit system would immediately dry up, or sting us with vast interest rates. They couldn't exist otherwise, and then homeowning and car purchase would again be only within reach for the rich.<br/><br/>There are dozens or more or less serious errors in it.

A rape of social standing, of identity.<br/><br/>Burns gives out great lines, poetic heft, to everyone, even vicious people like Ma and Milkman. <br/><blockquote><i>Why can’t you take on board you’re not wanted, that your advances are not to be accepted, that it’s thanks but no thanks? You mean nothing to us, we don’t even think of you and another thing, you can’t just act with impunity, carrying on as if it didn’thappen, as if you didn’t start this, as if you didn’t stir things up. You’re a cat – that’s right, you heard us, a cat – a double cat! We don’t think you’re up to the level of even being a cat. But don’t you push us so far because this is aggravated harassment<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Maybe-girlfriend's own register is a little tiring, bright and arch and digressive (but not enough to keep the  the pall of her surroundings lifted). It might be an attempt to balance out the setting with comically out-of-place lyricism, but if so it works strangely:<br/><blockquote><i>'But understand, daughter,’ went on ma, ‘I'm not saying my rear cannot now fit in the chair because the chair's become too tight for it. It can still fit in. It’s just that now it encompasses a certain amount of extra inches or fractions of inches to which it has never acclimatised and which in the old days didn’t used to be.'<br/>'I knew now, of course, what she was driving at, though unsure still how to respond.... My response therefore, should be comparable to her own words, should be of like tone and weight in order to acknowledge and to respect her older status, even her originality indelineating the depth of her rear condition in relation to the chair she was speaking of.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>The Community hates the depressed and the upbeat (""shiny""), the chaste and the promiscuous, the deviation:<br/><blockquote><i>And that was the trouble with the shiny people. Take a whole group of individuals who weren’t shiny, maybe a whole community, a whole nation, or maybe just a statelet immersed long-term on the physical and energetic planes in the dark mental energies; conditioned too, through years of personal and communal suffering, to be overladen with heaviness and grief and fear and anger – well, these people could not, not at the drop of a hat, be open to any bright shining button of a person stepping into their environment and shining upon them just like that... <br/><br/>As for the environment, that too, would object, backing up the pessimism of its people, which was what happened where I lived where the whole place always seemed to be in the dark. It was as if the electric lights were turned off, always turned off, even though dusk was over so they should have been turned on yet nobody was turning them on and nobody noticed either, they weren’t on...<br/><br/>So shiny was bad, and 'too sad' was bad, and 'too joyous' was bad, which meant you had to go around not being anything; also not thinking, least not at top level, which was why everybody kept their private thoughts safe and sound in the recesses underneath.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>I quite liked the purely-functional names - ""maybe-boyfriend"", ""third-brother-in-law"", ""longest friend from primary school"", ""Somebody McSomebody"", though I see it's not a popular methodology on here. I think ""Milkman"" is the only proper name in it. <br/><br/>She belabours a good metaphor (the sunset from the front cover): even the colour of a beautiful sunset is an ideological matter, for these locals. They've a particular cached thought - ""the sky is blue"" - and refuse to let a fancy intellectual (a spirited French teacher) make them notice that the sky is currently anything but blue. Blatant wilful error in the face of decisive evidence, maintained to express one's identity: <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics"">welcome to the species</a>.<br/><br/>Reviewers call it funny, which it isn't really until Chapter Seven, until Milkman is gone and the <i>Carry On</i>-Tarantino part can kick off. There's <a href=""https://youtu.be/9BVKdy7BXBE?t=73"">this</a>:<br/><blockquote><i>Before Milkman, they had shot a binman, twobusdrivers, a road sweeper, a real milkman who was our milkman, then another person whodidn’t have any blue-collar or service-industry connections – all in mistake for Milkman. Thenthey shot Milkman. Then they played down the mistaken shootings while playing up theintended shooting, as if it had been Milkman and only Milkman they had shot all along.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>and<br/><blockquote><i>""You’re a female. He’s a male. You’re my sister-in-law and I don’t care how many of his family got murdered, he’s a bastard and would’ve been a bastard even if they hadn’t got murdered."" They hadn’t got murdered. Only four had got murdered. The other two had been a suicide and an accidental death.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Very tiring but worthy overall.",,,1,0

The inevitable neologisms are excellent, intensely suggestive of the new culture's inner life: death is just ""storage""; bodies are just ""sleeves"" and to be reincarnated is to be ""sleeved""; a plasma gun is a ""sunjet"". Murder is just ""organic damage"". Catholics are (once again) the world's underclass - unable to travel interstellar because it involves casual storage (suicide) and resleeving (heresy), and killed with near-impunity because they alone cannot <i>testify at their own murder trials</i>.

Advertising can be beamed obtrusively into your mind. The UN has become a Shady Galactic Empire.

That's obviously a formal hierarchy, Leaders > Loyalists > Workers, but Rao's first big left turn is to impose a second contradictory ordering on the 3 classes in developmental psychology terms: Clueless < Losers < Sociopaths. I like his subdivision of Losers into: Minimum-effort rationally-disengaged; Overperformers; future Sociopaths. It looks nasty, and Rao is uninterested in making it seem moral or immoral, but if this is how the leaders actually think, Rao is doing us (the 99%) a service. <br/><br/>Is this system justified and true? No. Rao writes the best clickbait in the world, what he calls ""insight porn"".    It is the verbal equivalent of the noise an F1 engine makes on a 200m straight. The class theory in this would make for a great literary theory, a blueprint for future <i>Office Space</i>s. Myers-Briggs is marginally better than the dumb view of people as more or less defective versions of one character. So too is this better than ""bosses/workers"" cod Marxism. <br/><br/>(He could have massively increased his audience and reduced unwanted connotations by renaming ""Losers"" to ""Workers"" <br/><blockquote><i>        the Loser — really not a loser at all if you think about it — pays his dues, does not ask for much, and finds meaning in his life elsewhere<br/></blockquote></i>)<br/><br/>He has a weird relationship with the amoral elites - he often says things like<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    In the big games of life, those involving the Darwinian dimensions of sex, money or power, we don’t get to define the rules. And it is only those games that can create social value.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>putting destiny and ultimate value in their hands. And he clearly thinks of himself as a post-reality-shock enlightened figure. And yet he rags on the inauthenticity, nihilism, cruelty, hollowness of his 'Sociopaths'.<br/><br/>There are dozens of acute, contentious, boggling passages like<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    For high-empathy people, all this is natural. By participating in collective feeling in groups of any size, and reacting to basic attraction/aversion drives, you can actually safely navigate all the complexity by instinct.<br/>    Not only can you do this, you will actually feel good doing this. This feeling is called happiness. I don’t have time to go into this, but happiness is entirely a social phenomenon, and there’s plenty of evidence that the best way (and from my reading, the only way) to get happy is to get sociable. Non-social feelings that seem like happiness turn out, upon further examination, to be distinct emotions like contentment, equanimity or hedonistic pleasure<br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i><br/>    the level of abstraction that we are concerned with, all theories of developmental psychology – Freud’s, Piaget’s, Erikson’s, Maslow’s – say roughly the same thing about arrested development: you are born Clueless and clue up in fits and starts. Bits of you get stuck and left behind at different points, and eventually you exhaust your capacity for real change and stall (though you may retain an illusion that you are on a path of “lifelong growth and learning,” itself a pattern of arrested development)<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>I can imagine a teenager reading this and becoming absolutely insufferable.

We hope to show people and their stories and the numbers, together. We set out to do this mainly to explore how these two perspectives compare, but along the way we found that this raised an awkward question: are the two faces of risk compatible? Can risk claim to be true to the numbers and to you at the same time? We will present both sides as we try to find out, but we will tell you our conclusion now. It can’t.

The taste of the coffee, my satisfaction at its flavor, the feeling of the warm cup in my hand—while these are immediate facts with which I am acquainted, they reach back into a dark wilderness of facts that I will never come to know.<br/><br/>... Where am I, that I have such a poor view of things? And what sort of thing am I that both my outside and my inside are so obscure? ...Am I inside my skull? Let’s say yes for the moment, because we are quickly running out of places to look for me. Where inside my skull might I be? And if I’m up there in my head, how is the rest of me </i>me?<br/></blockquote></i> <br/>Surprisingly humble and sincere. Some readers feel tricked - feel that Harris is smuggling in science under soft, false pretences. This isn't fair; he has done this stuff for decades, visited lamas in Tibet, put in the work. It's implausible that he would do so much insincerely; whatever his other failings, he is actually trying to bridge the two kinds of seekers.* (That said, this book design is a masterpiece of camouflage. Look at the soft colours, the sunny logo, the sans-serif purity, the unthreatening subtitle. Compare his other books!)<br/><br/>However: consider all the things people mean by ""spirituality"":<br/>1. subjective knowledge of ultimate / immaterial reality<br/>1b. gaining supernatural abilities as a result<br/>2. one's deep moral or existential values<br/>3. personal growth<br/>4. feeling of awe-inspiring beauty<br/>5. introspection; close contact with one's own ""inner dimension""<br/>6. ""the ability to step a little back from your emotions and thoughts, observe them as they are without getting swept up in them, and then evaluating them critically""<br/>7. sense of love towards (all) others<br/>8. the quest to see the ego and the self as illusory<br/><br/>With so much popular support - with so much baggage - it's not possible to throw out the word or concept; instead we have to try and reform it. This is Harris' mission - though in fact he focusses almost exclusively on (5) -> (8), the standard Buddhist therapy of not being hurt by distraction, bad luck, frustrated desires. <br/><br/>He rejects (1) straightforwardly, in favour of psychologising the whole practice. Paraphrased: 'Instead of making you experience Reality, meditation lets you experience your mind; instead of strengthening your insubstantial soul, you're strengthening your mind.' This is a healthy kind of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_reconstruction"">reconstruction</a> in my view, but it certainly leads him to make controversial claims like ""<i>The deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self</i>"". Metaphysically profligate readers will have no fun here. (But they knew that already.)<br/><br/>How can a scientist (or at least a pro-science talking head) boost a practice with the aim of rejecting <i>thought</i>? The trick is to distinguish thinking / experiencing (which are after all the locus of all value, and of decisions and creativity) from <i>identifying</i> with the stream of your thoughts, from being carried away, from being endlessly distracted. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/><i>Does this stuff work?</i> It <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818837"">probably does</a> for stress reduction - at least like taking a nap does, or a valium, or sitting still and breathing deeply for a bit. And on the other end, it is definitely not the source of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_energy"">supernatural brain-juice-drinking power</a>. So the truth is somewhere between these two limits, and we drift, deciding whether to spend time on it.<br/><br/>I'm an unpromising practitioner. For instance, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_proliferation"">this</a> is kind of my jam. It's not the indescribability that bothers me - after all, any knowledge-how is indescribable (or rather describable only with <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/205757/neural-network-how-are-number-of-parameters-calculated"">millions of parameters</a>). You can accept e.g. Hume or Parfit's reasoning - you can have the propositional knowledge, can <a href=""https://fs.blog/2013/01/knowing-that-versus-knowing-how/"">know that</a> ""there is no self beyond my bundle of experiences"". Meditation is supposed to be the know-how of nonessentialism, the skill of actually paying attention to the implications of this System-2 judgment.<br/><br/>But being 'nonconceptual' means no language, no premises, no reason, no jokes, no connection, no comparison, using none of my strengths, leaving none of my spoor. This is a great loss to me.<br/><br/>I don't know that I do suffer as a result of identifying with my thoughts; I don't think that dissatisfaction lurks in every sensation I ever experience or also my whole life in retrospect. But the old claim, similar to Marxist or feminist 'false consciousness', is that I am too owned to realise I'm being owned:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>""beginning meditators... report after days or weeks of intensive practice that their attention is carried away by thought every few seconds. This is actually progress. It takes a certain degree of concentration to even notice how distracted you are.""<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Freedom from desire sounds much like death to me, for all that Harris and others argue that it can somehow coexist with passion against the suffering of others, with striving to be a better person, with chipping in to the <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=I+hereby+renounce+the+right+to+complacency%2C+and+vow+lifelong+to+take+only+what+minimum+of+leisure+is+necessary+to+my+productivity%2C+viewing+health%2C+happiness%2C+rest%2C+and+play+as+means%2C+not+ends%2C+and+that%2C+while+Utopia+provides+my+needs%2C+I+will+commit+the+full+produce+of+my+labors+to+our+collective+effort+to+redirect+the+path+of+human+life+away+from+death+and+towards+the+stars.&oq=I+hereby+renounce+the+right+to+complacency%2C+and+vow+lifelong+to+take+only+what+minimum+of+leisure+is+necessary+to+my+productivity%2C+viewing+health%2C+happiness%2C+rest%2C+and+play+as+means%2C+not+ends%2C+and+that%2C+while+Utopia+provides+my+needs%2C+I+will+commit+the+full+produce+of+my+labors+to+our+collective+effort+to+redirect+the+path+of+human+life+away+from+death+and+towards+the+stars"">Great Project</a> of discovery, compassion, optimisation. Luckily the two projects - really feeling that you are not your thoughts, not a homunculus behind your eyes having them; vs not wanting things because wanting leads to disappointment - seem to be separable.<br/><br/>A consolation: there's a sense in which meditation, introspection and phenomenology are highly, maximally empirical - they involve very close attention and analysis of the raw data. It just happens that the raw data (the sense-data) are irreplicable, private, closed, and so not directly a matter for science. Empiricism before science, consciousness without self. And I like this. <br/><br/>Mindfulness is billed as not just cool and true but <i>useful</i> - <br/><blockquote><i>    No doubt many distinct mechanisms are involved - the regulation of attention and behaviour, increased body awareness, inhibition of negative emotions, reframing of experience, changes in your view of the 'self', and so forth - and each of these will have their own neurophysiological basis.""<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Well, I do love self-regulation!<br/><br/>The following argument isn't explicitly stated by Harris, but I find it helpful as an existence-proof for the usefulness of nonessentialism:<br/>1. We are happy and perform well when we're in 'flow' states.<br/>2. Flow states involve ""losing"" yourself in a task, in a concrete, unhesitating sequence of perceptions and actions.<br/>3. Therefore losing yourself can be good and helpful.<br/><br/>Also<br/><br/>1. We do not directly apprehend the external world; we know it through sense-data plus massive computational modelling tricks in the brain.<br/>2. We know that the brain computes the wrong thing sometimes. (Cognitive biases, optical illusions, top-down processing, hallucinations.)<br/>3. So, if such a thing is possible, it could be helpful to attend to sense-data more closely, to rule out automatic-brain errors.<br/><br/>While I don't have a very clear philosophy of mind, I know I'm not a direct realist or substance dualist or identity essentialist, so I've no simple philosophical objections to breaking down the Self, either. Allons-y.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Even if I accept that mindfulness is a source of value, there's presumably still a tradeoff against clearer, quicker, more public sources: doing science or kindnesses or pleasures. <a href=""https://www.uk.dhamma.org/courses/10-day-courses/"">10 days spent in myself</a> is 10 days not learning, not exercising, not enjoying, not helping, not meeting, in solitary. (And even on the contemplative axis it competes with Stoicism, with yoga, with writing, with psychedelics.)<br/><br/><br/><i>How much work will it be?</i> Some contemplatives freely admit that the cost is very high: some contemplatives are not just salesmen. I met someone who claimed to be capital-e-enlightened. (He was otherwise articulate and modest.) He said it took 6 years' work, at many hours a week. I asked him if he could say how valuable it is in other terms - 'What else has been as good?' He said: a decade of intense psychotherapy, or two philosophy degrees. (<a href=""https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.22.0.than.html"">One ancient text</a> teases us by setting 'seven years' as the required period, but in true troll-Buddhist style it then slowly walks back this helpful definite statement.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>On that note: I was looking forward to writing a gotcha paradox here, but Harris (and thousands of years of arhats and yogis) pre-empted me:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>...the deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self -[but] to seek such freedom, as though it were a future state to be attained through effort, is to reinforce the chains of one's apparent bondage in each moment.<br/><br/>One [solution] is to simply ignore the paradox and adopt various techniques of meditation in the hope that a breakthrough will occur. Some people appear to succeed at this, but many fail... Goal-oriented modes of practice have the virtue of being easily taught, because a person can begin them without having had any fundamental insight...<br/><br/>...The other traditional response is... to concede that all efforts are doomed, because the urge to attain self-transcedence or any other mystical experience is a symptom of the very disease we want to cure. There is nothing to do but give up the search.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>I'm not actually worried by this, because I suspect the full-Buddhist anti-striving thing is unnecessary and... undesirable.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><br/>Why should an evolved creature have the power to inspect its own sense-data? If we are constantly distracting ourselves with reified thoughts, what evolutionary role did this play? At the top of this review is Harris' droll diss about people deluding themselves into thinking they are meditating - but how <i>can</i> we know that we, or anyone, is not deluded? (Brain scans of inhibited medial PFCs are interesting but merely suggestive.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Most of the above isn't directly from Harris, I'm riffing off <a href=""https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha"">better</a> <a href=""https://flightfromperfection.com/mindfulness-striving.html"">rationalist</a> reconstructions of this ancient one-weird-trick. (I actually don't know if this is any good, cos I don't know the area. Seems fine.)<br/><br/><br/>* Much of their anger is about his chapter warning of the history of abuse by gurus and yogis and so on. But like it or not this is a public service.",,,1,0

Many sentences could lose two-thirds of the words without losing any meaning; probably no-one exists for whom every chapter is relevant.

The trouble with evaluating leaders (this goes for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_investigator"">modern scientists</a> as much as corporate founders) is that they are able to take so much credit for the work of those they hire / train. Even so, Bezos had a lot of ideas - we know this because some failures are attributed to him, putting an upper bound at least on the file-drawer problem of Amazon's creativity. (Stone seems pretty good at tracking down the real inventors. And he literally dug through Bezos' garbage in search of details.) And he is a hyperactive micromanager, pulling conference call screens off the walls, ramming through his pet projects over any amount of opposition:<br/><blockquote><i>Almost alone, Bezos believed fervently in Prime, closely tracking sign-ups each day and intervening every timr the retail group dropped its promotions from the home page.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>The management style is/was macho, with an uneasy mix of flat objectivity (if you show the maths of your idea works, you are likely to get serious consideration) and imperial whim (like making everyone write meeting notes in full prose - which is based on no science in particular).<br/><blockquote><i>Bezos treats workers like expendable resources without taking into account their contributions to the company. That in turn allows him to coldly allocate capital and manpower and make hyperrational business decisions where another executive might let personal relationships intrude. But they also acknowledge that Bezos is primarily consumed with improving the company's performance and customer service...<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>    Some of Stone's anecdotes about this or that mid-level exec are neither funny nor illustrative, and make this feel like a reference text. I suppose there should be one.<br/><br/>With them so dominant now, it's easy to forget the stock crashing to $10, or Amazon being seriously threatened by a single Lehman analyst, or all the many failures like Auctions or zShops or A9.com. And that they really were another garage operation that took over the world.<br/><br/>Stone does push back a bit - the ""two-pizza team"" idea gets uncritically celebrated in business, but Stone says that the actual teams hate it. I'm fascinated by Bezos making each team come up with their own <a href=""http://www.andreweifler.com/fitness-functions/"">objective function</a> - but apparently this is also hated, on ""digging our own grave"" grounds. (Isn't any quantified performance metric hated?)<br/><br/>Then there's the context switch that makes the billions seem small: since he was a child, Bezos seems to honestly see himself as shepherding humanity into space, with Amazon a means to that end.<br/><br/>Not enough coverage of just how weird Amazon is, in terms of shareholder quiescence, the astonishing amount of cheap capital it hoovers up, its terrible reputation among 90s and 00s analyst as a ""nonprofit scam"". It was <a href=""https://ycharts.com/companies/AMZN/profit_margin"">almost never profitable</a> for 20 straight years, but people kept throwing money into the bubble... which has stopped being a bubble (because of AWS, not really retail). The tiny tax burden that people decry should start growing, and antitrust attention too.<br/><br/>No attention to what we should expect of Amazon's effect on literature and ideas, given the mass die-off of local bookshops <i>and</i> the weakening of gatekeeper publishers. (I don't know what the effect is either, but if I wrote a book about them I hope I would have a go.)<br/><br/>Skimmed a bit, e.g. 2004, the Zappos chapter, ",,,1,0

(It covers such anti-scientific fields as alternative medicine, journalism, politics, and policy. You may regard anti-vaxxers, face cream 'science', homeopathy, and AIDS denialism as too obviously false to be worth your time deriding. But these hopeful, manipulative falsehoods are where many if not most live: someone has to defend people.)<br/><br/>This makes it a collection of a hundred enjoyable tutorials in statistics, experimental method, and epistemology:<br/><blockquote><i>Alternative therapists don't kill many people, but they do make a great teaching tool for the basics of evidence-based medicine, because their efforts to distort science are so extreme. When they pervert the activities of people who should know better &#8211; medicines regulators, or universities &#8211; it throws sharp relief onto the role of science and evidence in culture...</i><br/></blockquote><br/>Goldacre is a gifted populariser: by focussing on particular abuses, he is able to animate very hard and theoretical topics by leveraging our anger, or our humour. (In a similar way to Nassim Taleb's snark. Of course, as strict empiricists, the two men share many targets: the powerful and overconfident, the famed and hollow, the predatory and avaricious). Since <a href=""http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/keep-libel-laws-out-of-science.html"">British libel law</a> opens him to constant financial hazard, <i>even when he is entirely careful and correct</i>, he calls his writing ""pop science with a gun to your head"". (Actually it is mostly pop metascience; even better. There are shout-outs to the great critics of C20th science: <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/309/6954/597"">Celia Mulrow</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/"">John Ioannidis</a>, <a href=""http://datacolada.org/"">Uri Simonsohn</a>, who are too-rarely praised; for they turned on the people who might otherwise have lionised them.)<br/><br/>He shows policy analysis to be lagging a century behind the standard set by medical trials, and not mostly for the good reasons (which are: that they have a more <a href=""https://pileusblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/02/the-causal-density-of-human-behavior/"">causally dense</a> subject than medicine has; and because they face absolute ethical restrictions on their experiments: it is politically impossible to experiment with welfare systems). e.g.: Policy people set <i>no</i> required evidence threshold before administering their treatments en masse, have no controls, no randomisation, no calibration, no statements of formal uncertainty, no malpractice system to punish their recklessness, nor often any honest fucking posthoc <i>evaluation</i> of their treatment.<br/><blockquote>[Andrew Lansley's] <i>pretence at data-driven neutrality is not just irritating, it's also hard to admire. There's no need to hide behind a cloak of scientific authority, murmuring the word ""evidence"" into microphones. If your reforms are a matter of ideology, legacy, whim and faith, then, like many of your predecessors, you could simply say so, and leave ""evidence"" to people who mean it.</i><br/></blockquote><br/>Journalists come across as badly as the quacks - even BBC, Panorama, C4 News. This <i>may</i> be being ameliorated at last by the rise of the specialised blogospheres and by the Nate Silver / <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-map-us-police-killings"">Rich Harris</a> / <a href=""http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/author/keithfray/"">Keith Frey</a> school of data journalism.

The time had clearly come to mount a massive counter-attack.<br/><br/>...nerds are more powerful than we know. Changing mainstream media will be hard, but you can help create parallel options. More academics should blog, post videos, post audio, post lectures, offer articles and more. You'll enjoy it: I've had threats and blackmail, abuse, smears and formal complaints with forged documentation. But it's worth it, for one simple reason: pulling bad science apart is the best teaching gimmick I know for explaining how good science works. I'm not a policeman, and I've never set out to produce a long list of what's right and what's wrong.

Besides the subtle portrayal of the latent Reformation revolution, there's also a far more important upheaval: the rise of brilliant laymen and potent commoners (e.g. More and Cromwell), that is, the beginning of the end of feudalism.<br/><br/>Never been very interested in the Tudors. Henry is fickle and narcissistic even compared to other early Modern monarchs, and Anne is a boring climber. He appeared to set off a revolution for no better reason than he was too sexist to accept a female heir. Mantel shows how Henry, Anne and Katherine are a microcosm of their time - <i>Mother Church vs the nationalism-Protestantism complex</i>, and England slowly tearing itself away from former to latter. The first Brexit.<br/><br/>It's an imperfect model - Henry still burns un-Catholic books and men, and Luther and Tyndale don't support the shady divorce (against their own interests). A mixture of lust, opportunism, influence from competent rebels (Cromwell, Cranmer)?<br/><br/><br/>Most characters are portrayed as pragmatic and modern, prayer aside. They know most relics are bogus, that the ""medicine"" of the day is hazardous, that the Church's decisions are deeply contingent and political, and they mock the superstitious lord who believes in ghosts. This is probably going too far, but it makes for great fiction.<br/><br/>The treatment of More vs Cromwell is the reverse of that in <i>A Man for All Seasons</i>: here Cromwell is a rational, catholic, and empathetic gent, while More is a scary authoritarian fundamentalist, closer to a Daesh jihadi than Rowan Williams.<br/><blockquote><i>    [Cromwell] can’t imagine himself reading [the Bible] to his household; he is not, like Thomas More, some sort of failed priest, a frustrated preacher. He never sees More, a star in another firmament, who acknowledges him with a grim nod - without wanting to ask him, what’s wrong with you? Or what’s wrong with me? Why does everything you know, and everything you have learnt, confirm you in what you have believed before? Whereas in my case, what I grew up with, and what I thought I believed, is chipped away, a little and a little, a fragment then a piece and then a piece more. With every month that passes, the corners are knocked off the certainties of this world: and the next world too.</blockquote></i><br/><br/><br/>Mantel has a funny way of letting her grammar show that Cromwell is The Man - she'll use ""<i>he</i>"" to mark him, even when this breaks the normal ""pronouns refer to the most recent subject of that gender"" convention. This is disorienting, but I appreciate the effect.<br/><br/>I was recently baffled by this sentence, from a contemporary American evangelical: ""<i>I was baptised Catholic before I became a Christian</i>."" The violence of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation is the nastiest evidence of the power and horror of the narcissism of small differences.<br/><br/><br/>I liked the book recommendations, the 16th Century equivalents of discussions on here. It is <i>so</i> hard to know, from 500 years away, what's worth reading. Though I suppose the real C16th dross is dead, all out of print, unarchived, unextant. For instance:<br/><blockquote><i>Castiglione says that everything that can be understood by men can be understood by women, that their apprehension is the same, their faculties, no doubt their loves and hates.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>This bit was funny: <br/><blockquote><i>When the last treason act was made, no one could circulate their words in a printed book or bill, because printed books were not thought of. He feels a moment of jealousy towards the dead, to those who served kings in slower times than these; now a days the  products  of  some  bought  or  poisoned  brain  can  be  disseminated through Europe in a month.<blockquote><i><br/></blockquote></i><br/>He's talking about a time with ~<a href=""https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/media/1771/broadberry-teaching-1.pdf"">0.1%</a> annual growth, starting from very little; where new books per year was still in the three digits; where new actual insights per year was probably lower, where it takes an entire month and ~thousands of pounds for one troll to even partially foul a discussion.",,,1,0

(^) Besides, MacFarquhar has some deep reflections on the good life and human nature to work through. So: There are people who shape their lives around the need of the world – in particular around strangers who are <a href=""http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/diseases/en/"">constantly</a>, in some sense, drowning. This category of person does more than just work a caring job and be dead nice to those around them: instead, their entire lives are dominated by the attempt to do the <i>most</i> good.<br/>The profiled altruists are:<br/><ul><br/>- <li><a href=""http://www.peacehost.net/Dorothy/"">A fairly fearless nurse</a> who organised the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_for_Life"">Fast for Life</a> and trained generations of Nicaraguan nurses, continuing for thirty years despite specific threats to her life by Contras.</li><br/>- <li>A pseudonymous animal rights activist who has rescued or won improved conditions for millions of chickens.</li><br/>- <li>Two early effective altruists, <a href=""http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/whats-it-like-to-give-half.html"">Julia</a> and <a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/p/earning-to-give-transcript"">Jeff</a>, who live frugally and donate more than half of their salaries to the most effective NGOs in the world.

She calls them ""do-gooders"" while admitting the term is dismissive.** Even the most humble and quiet do-gooder is, she thinks, making an extremely arrogant claim: that the moral intuitions of the whole species - i.e. family favouritism, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supererogation"">supererogation</a>, the right to ignore the suffering of strangers - are totally wrong. She leaves no-one unsuspected.<br/><blockquote><i>an extreme morality as Singer's or Godwin's can seem not just oppressively demanding but actually evil, because it violates your duty to yourself. To require a person to think of himself as a tool for the general good could be seen as equivalent of kidnapping a person off the street and harvesting his organs to save three or four lives... even to ask this of yourself seems wrong, even perverted. Impartial, universal love seems the antithesis of what we value about deep human attachment.</i></blockquote><br/>But these lives are victory laps: the victory of broad reason over narrow animality. MacFarquhar is more nuanced, less willing to dismiss particularism, nepotism and speciesism – which are together known as common sense. (Though I have only a mild case of the radicals: for instance, I am mostly immune to misery about the state of the world, and I help my loved ones without much guilt. I'm <a href=""https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:YclKt_ybNHMJ:https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk"">giving 10% now</a> and 50% eventually, but I am such a bookish scruff that the absence of luxuries does not really cramp my life at all.)<br/><br/>One part of Williams' humanist case against radical altruism has dissolved in the last decade: the idea that single-minded ethical focus must erode your connection to your community. Well, the effective altruists are growing in number and maturity; they <a href=""https://www.effectivealtruism.org/get-involved/"">offer a deep, global community</a> of at least partially serious people to support and be supported by: and all with the stamp of moral consistency.<br/><br/>MacFarquhar doesn't much like utilitarianism, but she is too moved and impressed with her subjects to take the standard, safe, quietist line (which her <a href=""http://inthesetimes.com/article/18407/helping-a-drowning-stranger"">reviewers</a> have tended to). Throughout, she presents contradictory philosophical propositions, and makes it difficult to know which she believes; she constantly uses indirect speech and deictic discussion, blurring her voice with the debate at hand. This is, I think, an impressive rhetorical strategy – an ""<a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/10/philosophy-between-the-lines.html"">esoteric</a>"" one. The book is addressed to common sense readers, but also to our uncertainty and faint guilt; it's dedicated to her parents, but explicitly constructed to bring us closer to the altruists:<br/><a name=""longcon""></a><br/><blockquote><i>I took out all the physical descriptions because if you’re looking at someone’s physical appearance, you’re on the outside. Similarly quotations, which seem as though they should be the most intimate form, because they come directly from the person’s mouth. Again, in fact, the only way you hear someone speaking is if you’re outside them. So if you translate quotation into interior thought, which simply means taking away the quotation marks and saying ‘he thought’ rather than ‘he said’ – that’s a more intimate way of encountering someone.</i>***</blockquote><br/>So <i>Strangers Drowning</i> covertly brings us closer to radical altruism. Her task is not to establish their ethical premises, nor to win over new obsessives: instead, she simply shows us their sincerity and incredible effects on the world – and, better, shows the lack of evidence and interpretive charity behind their opponents' aspersions. (This goes for the Freudians, the Objectivists, and the anti ""codependency"" crowd.) It humanises the threatening side of ultimate goodness. She mostly avoids editorialising about the radicals. But one of her clear conclusions is that these people are not deficient, instead having something most people lack:<br/><blockquote><i>What do-gooders lack is not happiness but innocence. They lack that happy blindness that allows most people, most of the time, to shut their minds to what is unbearable. Do-gooders have forced themselves to know, and keep on knowing, that everything they do affects other people, and that sometimes (though not always) their joy is purchased with other people's joy. And, remembering that, they open themselves to a sense of unlimited, crushing responsibility...<br/><br/>The </i>need<i> of the world was like death, </i>[Julia]<i> thought — everyone knew about it, but the thought was so annihilating that they had to push it out of consciousness or it would crush them. She understood, and yet did not understand, why other people didn't give more than they did. How did they allow themselves such permission? How could they not help?</i></blockquote><br/>while also noting that, in general<br/><blockquote><i>If there is a struggle between morality and life, life will win... Not always, not in every case, but life will win in the end. Sometimes a person will die for a cause; sometimes a person will give up for duty's sake the things that are to him most precious. But most of the time, the urge to live, to give to your family, to seek beauty, to act spontaneously... or to do any number of things other than helping people, is too strong to be overridden... It may be true that not everyone should be a do-gooder. But it is also true that these strange, hopeful, tough, idealistic, demanding, life-threatening, and relentless people, by their extravagant example, help keep those life-sustaining qualities alive.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>An amazing book, anyway: charged, critical, structurally ingenious, and filled with humanity – or, with this other, better thing.<br/><br/><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LZ2UPDZqwSA/V__tmcnCXEI/AAAAAAAACvE/-2kGPLHaqbkV3j6ZDK_XbqP6G5SD5toNQCLcB/s1600/selung.png"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LZ2UPDZqwSA/V__tmcnCXEI/AAAAAAAACvE/-2kGPLHaqbkV3j6ZDK_XbqP6G5SD5toNQCLcB/s640/selung.png"" height=""480"" border=""0"" width=""400""></a><br/><small>""Sedia hujan sebelum payung"" (c) <a href=""http://zakyarifin.tumblr.com/post/134379295094/sedia-hujan-sebelum-payung-ohrainydays<br/>"">Zaky Arifin</a> (2015)</small></div><br/><blockquote><br/><sup>†</sup> Note the absent quotation marks around MacFarquhar's report of the psychoanalysts' and Williams' positions. <br/><br/>The chapter on the blitheness and cruelty of the psychoanalysts enraged me - all the more because MacFarquhar leaves their unscientific bullshit unchallenged, instead letting it mock and degrade itself.

It certainly handles the same themes, simply inverted in their consequences: we see drugs as <i>enablers</i> of enlightenment; a much healthier view of suffering, as a pointless trap; a surprisingly pragmatic view of genetic engineering; and a very balanced view of civilisation and economic development. <br/><br/>So: he constructs a Taoist-Hindu-Buddhist utopia which mostly avoids primitivism and annoying mysticism for a sustainable East plus West non-industrial modernity. It's not my idea of paradise, but other people's utopias usually aren't. Moreover, it is a <i>doomed</i> utopia nestled in nasty 1950s international political economy. The animating enemy of <i>Island</i> is not the authoritarian consequences of technology, but what Scott Alexander <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"">calls Moloch</a>: the forces of self-fulfilling inevitability and destructive competition.<br/><br/>Protagonist is a mirror of John the Savage: an open-minded liar and shill, a fallen outsider who manages to undermine the utopia he infiltrates. Huxley himself is the model for him: in fact we can see Will's journey from cynical aestheticism to materialist spirituality as autobiography in allegory. The mystic character, Rani, is amazing: an enraging theosophical flake. This reflects well on Huxley's own weirdness: the Rani is as far from traditional organised religion as Huxley is from her.<br/><br/>Given the times and his project, lots of Huxley's worldview have <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny"">become clichés</a>: e.g. “you forget to pay attention to what's happening. And that's the same as not being here and now ”. The prose is arch and syrupy but I like it. (<i>BNW</i> is saddled by the air of a smug jeremiad. <i>Island</i> is every bit as didactic but nowhere near as smug.) It's chock-full of bad poetry though. I love his use of reported speech to denote characters he disrespects: this saves him the bother of writing it and us the bother  of reading and makes a conspiracy of us and Huxley: <br/><blockquote><br/>	<i>He turned to Will and treated him to a long and flowery farewell. <br/><br/><br><i>In polysyllables, Mr Bahu hedged diplomatically. On the one hand, yes; but on  the other hand, no. From one point of view, white; but from a different angle, distinctly black.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Pala's structure is cool but not at all radical enough to solve what is wrong with us, I think – technology is controlled very carefully and considered one of the 'dozens' of fronts to aid people on. (Hypnotherapy and tantra are given way more credit than they deserve, for instance.) Is “one-third” of suffering intrinsic? I look forward to science seeing if that is the case. I elect Huxley into the hall of fame of people who make a very popular error and later recant to no acclaim.

Thermodynamics is the science of change, and without change there is nothing to be said...<br/><br/>Tools, methods and ideas developed to understand how the blind material fabric of the universe behaves are finding application in arenas for which they were never designed, and for which they might at first glance appear ridiculously inappropriate. Physics is finding its place in a science of society.</i></blockquote><br/>Introduces a hundred topics from thermodynamics, economics, econophysics, game theory, and fields which don't have a name yet, including intuitive explanations of fearsome concepts like: <br/><ul><br/><li>self-organized criticality</li><li>the 2D and 3D Ising model</li><li>diffusion-limited aggregation in bacteria and cities</li><li>Lévy-stability</li><li>the business cycle</li><li>random walks</li><li>superfluidity and supercooling phase transitions</li><li>bifurcation theory</li><li>traffic flow</li><li>Zipf's law</li><li>the Small world phenomenon</li><li>catastrophe theory</li>... <br/></ul><br/>Unlike shiny TED-style nonfiction, he refers directly to the original scientific papers and includes small interviews with the original researchers. No equations, but beautiful diagrams relating micro with macro, too: snowflakes to traffic and bacterial colonies to cities.<br/><br/>The book's reception, in the main by middlebrow, mathematically illiterate reviewers shocked me a bit: their banner conclusions were ""boo! people aren't particles!!"", a truism which Ball spends much of the book thinking about, and ""aaar horrible people have said they've found the laws of society before!!"", a truism the first fifth of the book is a history of. In their haste to protect ordinary human difference from averages, and the notion of free will from technical explanations, they flee to safe refuges like ""complexity"" and ""reflexivity"", i.e. out of science. Ball can speak for himself though:<br/><blockquote><i>The notion that we could ever construct a scientific ""utopia theory"" </i>[e.g. classical Marxism] <i>is, then, doomed to absurdity. Certainly, a ""physics of society"" can provide nothing of the sort. One does not build an ideal world from scientifically based traffic planning, market analysis, criminology, network design, game theory, and the gamut of other ideas discussed in this book. Concepts and models drawn from physics are almost certainly going to find their way into other areas of social science, but they are not going to provide a comprehensive theory of society, nor are they going to make traditional sociology, economics, or political science redundant. The skill lies in deciding where a mechanistic, quantitative model is appropriate for describing human behavior, and where it is likely to produce nothing but a grotesque caricature. This is a skill that is still being acquired, and it is likely that there will be embarrassments along the way. <br/><br/>But properly and judiciously applied, physical science can furnish some valuable tools in areas such as social, economic, and civic planning, and in international negotiation and legislation. It may help us to avoid bad decisions; if we are lucky, it will give us some foresight. If there are emergent laws of traffic, of pedestrian motions, of network topologies, of urban growth, we need to know them in order to plan effectively. Once we acknowledge the universality displayed in the physical world, it should come as no surprise that the world of human social affairs is not necessarily a tabula rasa, open to all options.<br/><br/>Society is complex but that does not place it beyond our ken. As we have seen, complexity of form and organization can arise from simple underlying principles if they are followed simultaneously by a great many individuals.</i></blockquote><br/>There is a real question about how deep into human behaviour the statistical approach can go. Econophysics, as a term and as a living, funded academic subfield, <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore#q=econophysics"">fizzled out shortly after this book was published</a>. Apparently the <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Self-organized_criticality"">SOC</a> results have come in for a lot of criticism, though mostly of their overreach than the method being humanistically inapplicable or whatevs.<br/><br/>Even so, I wish I had read this 5 years ago: it would have saved me lots of contortions. it taught me a huge amount anyway. (e.g. the <i>huge</i> moral panic, following the invention of descriptive statistics, about <i>ever</i> using means to describe <i>any</i> human characteristics, since the remarkable stability of e.g. the C17th London crime rate across decades seemed to speak of divine or diabolical insurance.)

This puts him in the <a href=""https://scienceheroes.com/"">top 50 life-savers</a> ever. But what is most amazing (and endearing) is just how unsophisticated he was. <br/><blockquote><i><br/>     As at school, trivial examples of ‘eccentricity’ circulated in Bletchley circles. Near the beginning of June he would suffer from hay fever, which blinded him as he cycled to work, so he would use a gas mask to keep the pollen out, regardless of how he looked. The bicycle itself was unique, since it required the counting of revolutions until a certain bent spoke touched a certain link (rather like a cipher machine), when action would have to be taken to prevent the chain coming off. Alan had been delighted at having, as it were, deciphered the fault in the mechanism, which meant that he saved himself weeks of waiting for repairs, at a time when the bicycle had again become what it was when invented – the means of freedom. It also meant that no one else could ride it.<br/><br/>    He made a more explicit defence of his tea-mug (again irreplaceable, in wartime conditions) by attaching it with a combination lock to a Hut 8 radiator pipe. But it was picked, to tease him.<br/><br/>    Trousers held up by string, pyjama jacket under his sports coat – the stories, whether true or not, went the rounds. And now that he was in a position of authority, the nervousness of his manner was more open to comment. There was his voice, liable to stall in mid-sentence with a tense, high-pitched ‘Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah’ while he fished, his brain almost visibly labouring away, for the right expression, meanwhile preventing interruption. The word, when it came, might be an unexpected one, a homely analogy, slang expression, pun or wild scheme or rude suggestion accompanied with his machine-like laugh; bold but not with the coarseness of one who had seen it all and been disillusioned, but with the sharpness of one seeing it through strangely fresh eyes. ‘Schoolboyish’ was the only word they had for it. Once a personnel form came round the Huts, and some joker filled in for him, ‘Turing A.M. Age 21’, but others, including Joan, said it should be ‘Age 16’...<br/><br/>    It was demeaning, but the repetition of superficial anecdotes about his usually quite sensible solutions to life’s small challenges served the useful purpose of deflecting attention away from the more dangerous and difficult questions about what an Alan Turing might think about the world in which he lived. English ‘eccentricity’ served as a safety valve for those who doubted the general rules of society. More sensitive people at Bletchley were aware of layers of introspection and subtlety of manner that lay beneath the occasional funny stories. But perhaps he himself welcomed the chortling over his habits, which created a line of defence for himself, without a loss of integrity. <br/></i></blockquote><br/>We have words for this now (""nerd"", ""wonk"", ""aspie""), and massive institutions, and even social movements, but at the time he had to make do with ""don"", and hide inside academia. Again: the problem wasn't him, it was us.<br/><br/><hr /><br/><br/>He gets called a mathematician most often, I suppose because people don't want to be anachronistic. But scroll up: his most famous work is as a logician and a systems architect, and much of the rest is statistics and algorithmics and cognitive science. He was falling between several chairs, until computer science caught up with him:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>a pure mathematician worked in a symbolic world and not with things. The machine seemed to be a contradiction... For Alan Turing personally, the machine was a symptom of something that could not be answered by mathematics alone. He was working within the central problems of classical number theory, and making a contribution to it, but this was not enough. The Turing machine, and the ordinal logics, formalising the workings of the mind; Wittgenstein’s enquiries; the electric multiplier and now this concatenation of gear wheels – they all spoke of making some connection between the abstract and the physical. It was not science, not ‘applied mathematics’, but a sort of applied logic, something that had no name. </i></blockquote><br/><br/>The philosopher-engineer. One of several moments in Hodge's book that left me dumbstruck is Turing <a href=""https://praxisblog.wordpress.com/2008/03/05/wittgenstein-versus-turing-spelling-of-the-second-order/"">arguing with Wittgenstein</a> about the foundations of mathematics. (In the spring of 1939 they were both teaching courses at Cambridge called that!) Bit awkward, and in my view Alan goes easy on Ludwig. But you still couldn't make it up.<br/><br/>The government employed Turing for 9 years, paying him about £6000 over the duration (£150k in today's money). In that time he produced 3 gigantically advanced systems (most of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hut_8"">Hut 8</a> system, the <a href=""http://www.turing.org.uk/sources/delilah.html"">Delilah</a> and the ACE design), about 10 or 20 years ahead of their time. Hodges sees this as a triumph of managerial socialism. Now, breaking naval enigma for £6k is an unbelievable deal (the savings from undestroyed shipping and cargo would be in the billions). But the government suppressed Delilah and totally screwed up the ACE project. So I'm not sure if we can cheer too much. Keynes says somewhere that<br/><blockquote><i>The important thing for Government is not to do things which individuals are doing already, and to do them a little better or a little worse; but to do those things which at present are not done at all.</i></blockquote><br/>This is true of Enigma, I suppose. But instructive failures are only helpful if they occur in public. (As at least the ACE report was.)<br/><br/>The most annoying part of the films making up emotionally powerful unifying themes for Turing is that they are already there. (But to grasp them, you'd have to actually display what was most wonderful and important about him, his technical work, and there goes the box office.) Anyway, here's one that made me cry:<br/><blockquote><i>In an end-of-term sing-song [at Sherborne, when Turing was 12], the following couplet described him: <br/><blockquote>Turing’s fond of the football field<br/>For geometric problems the touch-lines yield<br/></blockquote><br/>... another verse had him ‘watching the daisies grow’ during hockey... although intended as a joke against his dreamy passivity, there might have been a truth in the observation.<br/><br/><br/>[20 years later] ...One day he and Joan were lying on the Bletchley lawn looking at the daisies... Alan produced a fir cone from his pocket, on which the Fibonacci numbers could be traced rather clearly, but the same idea could also be taken to apply to the florets of the daisy flower.<br/><br/><br/>[30 years later] ...he was trying out on the computer the solution of the very difficult differential equations that arose when [one] followed the chemical theory of [plant] morphogenesis beyond the moment of budding... it also required some rather sophisticated applied mathematics, which involved the use of ‘operators’ rather as in quantum mechanics. Numerical analysis was also important... In this it was like a private atomic bomb, the computer in both cases following the development of interacting fluid waves.<br/><br/>...he also developed a purely descriptive theory of leaf-arrangement... using matrices to represent the winding of spirals of leaves or seeds round a stem or flower-head... The intention was that ultimately these two approaches would join up when he found a system of equations that would generate the Fibonacci patterns expressed by his matrices.<br/><br/>...Such observations reflected an insight gained from... [a program called] ‘Outline of Development of the Daisy’. He had quite literally been ‘watching the daisies grow’...  on his universal machine.<br/></i></blockquote>",,,1,0

He is a psychopath:<br/><blockquote><i>The [armed fascists] might try to chase him around in here. That would be fun; Nau's goons would find just how dangerous their tunnels had become...<br/></blockquote></i><br/>The evolutionary role of such people - both the fearless hero, Nuwen, and the bloodthirsty predator, Nau - is not handled explicitly, but Pham is held up as a paragon.<br/><br/>The arachnid aliens are much better than the hivehounds of the last book: Vinge and his translator characters' anthropomorphisations (or, rather, personalisations) are successful. Though maybe I'm just biased because the Spiders are shown going through their Information Revolution rather than their Pre-Renaissance period. It shows the deep connection between lack of economic growth, lack of intellectual growth and lack of social progress. The great scientist Sherkaner is also the one to challenge his society's sexual oppression. (""<i>Either way, the cycles were shattered forever</i>"") The ""counterlurk"" is the Enlightenment. It's an exquisite portrait of the great promise and risk of a technological society; you get the end of hunger and disease, you get spaceflight, but you also get nuclear standoffs.<br/><br/>    There are wonderful symmetries between the Spiders and humans: they each have odd, distended sleep cycles (the humans going into cryogenic suspension most of the time, the Spiders hibernating centuries until the sun reignites). There's also the Sura/Pham, Qiwi / Ezr, and Victory/Sherkaner pairings, the actual beauty of complementing another, of power couples with aims beyond their own power. <br/><br/>The title looks clumsy but isn't: it refers to a very large thought, that decentralising a system is the only way to make it last; that space is not only a cold and hostile place, it is also the way to break the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#It_is_the_nature_of_intelligent_life_to_destroy_itself"">terrible forces</a> that might work against mere interplanetary civilisations:<br/><blockquote><i>Pham would get their localizers in return for decent medical science.

But a thousand years from now, when Larson was dust, when his civilization had fallen as the planetbound inevitably did—a thousand years from now, Pham and the Qeng Ho would still be flying between the stars. And they would still have the Larson localizers... <br/><br/>""If you accept the trade I'm hoping for, you will live just as many years as I. But I am Qeng Ho. I sleep decades between the stars.

The alternative technological route is the great bit - what would industry look like without fossil fuel, a mechanised society without metal? - and the protagonist spiders who find the route are easy to empathise with. <br/><br/>Ants are used as robots, factories, laboratories, and eventually as CPUs:<br/><blockquote><i>There are hundreds of tamed ant colonies within Great Nest, not counting those in the surrounds that undertake the day-to-day business of producing food, clearing ground or fending off incursions of wild species.

This is because Vinge's telling is deterministic - they discover all the same stuff as us, in mostly the same order - and their culture a cartoon of ours.) <br/><br/>His other successful theme is incomprehension: females not understanding male liberation, spiders not understanding how a depressed solitary human could be sentient, Kern not understanding anything.

This one avoids all these things and is radical in an unconventional way.*<br/><br/>It's hard to know what to think of Thiel. He's easy to demonise - much easier than his loudmouth peer Musk. For instance, he's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship"">anti-college</a>, anti-affirmative-action, anti-Clinton - and even openly anti-competition! (And <a href=""https://www.inverse.com/article/29604-parabiosis-peter-thiel-blood"">a vampire</a>!)<br/><br/>But I've been impressed with his clarity and sense of proportion <a href=""https://www.weltwoche.ch/ausgaben/2018-29/artikel/en-hypnotische-massenphanomene-die-weltwoche-ausgabe-29-2018.html"">in</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/patrissimo/status/1026803467279581184"">interviews</a>, and nowhere here did I find the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard"">Girardian</a> anti-humanist conservatism that Gawker, Vulture, Vox, (...) made me expect. <br/><br/>For instance, this spiel moves me every time I hear it - the billions of hours we steal from children every year:<br/><blockquote><i>We teach every young person the same subjects in the same ways, irrespective of individual talents and preferences. Students who don’t learn best by sitting at a desk are made to feel somehow inferior, while children who excel on conventional measures like tests and assignments end up defining their identities in terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel reality.<br/><br/>And it gets worse as students ascend to higher levels of the tournament. Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking. For the privilege of bring turned into conformists, students (or their families) pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation. Why are we doing this to ourselves?<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>and similarly plaintive and humane bits:<br/><blockquote><i>Why work with a group of people who don’t even like each other? Many seem to think it’s a sacrifice necessary for making money. But taking a merely professional view of the workplace, in which free agents check in and out on a transactional basis, is worse than cold: it’s not even rational. Since time is your most valuable asset, it’s odd to spend it working with people who don’t envision any long-term future together. If you can’t count durable relationships among the fruits of your time at work, you haven’t invested your time well—even in purely financial terms. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>He is simply not simple. There are four positive references to Marx, four to Zuckerberg; two to Shakespeare, two to Bezos. He is a revisionist, then, intolerable to one side and oddly scathing about the other. (The chapter which translates Google's public rhetoric is not complimentary, for instance.) His niche seems to be <i>the repugnant but true</i>. So, like Taleb without the bluster and boasting. Which feels bizarre, like I'm in a different timeline where Taleb is actually aiming to not alienate a mass audience.<br/><br/>He says true things about things I know about: the history of economic thought (Walras did indeed lift the formalism of general equilibrium from physics) and the deadened air of contemporary Political Philosophy. His contribution to Trump's campaign was risible and maybe a defection against the world - but notice that <i>even this lapse</i> speaks to his ability to find unexpected truths - <a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/"">FiveThirtyEight gave</a> an 80% chance of a Clinton win at that point. So maybe his analysis and helpful checklist for startups are true too.<br/><br/>It's a shame few critics of capitalism will read this - for he is one, in his way:<br/><blockquote><i>Americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines. Actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition, all profits get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: If you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>(Of <i>actually-existing</i> capitalism I mean.)<br/><br/><br/>How on earth can you argue that monopolies give more social utility than high competition? First, distinguish three kinds: 1) criminal saboteurs and antitrustees (Apple); 2) government-licenced pets (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_US_dealership_disputes"">US car dealers</a>, the East India Companies); and 3) ""creative monopolies"" who gain their massive market share by doing something much, much better than everyone else. Obviously only the latter is good for society. <br/><br/>I was recently rushing to the airport, and pulled the quickest route (via underground via train via foot) from Google Maps. On the way, I noticed a sign in the Tube and realised that actually a different line was a much shorter route. So I walked 10 mins to that line, to find, of course, that it was suspended all weekend and, consequently, that Google is better at my life than I am. This is what he means.<br/><br/><br/>He goes further and says that the spare resources and vision of a creative monopoly is <i>the</i> source of innovation and so<br/><blockquote><i><br/>Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>The model is structurally the same as the old one about the Agrarian revolution: farms meant that for the first time, not everyone had to work full-time on food production, which let them specialise in other roles (war, gods, justice, lore) and eventually - slowly - invent new things.<br/><br/>Even so, I thought of an alternative road to dynamism, given perfect competition and so no profits: competition leads to low prices, which leads to savings, which are pooled into investment funds, which give entrepreneurs the same kind of space (and potentially the long view) that profits do.<br/><br/>Other people would not use the word ""monopoly"", trying to manage the connotations, trying to persuade us by smoothing things over. This is not Thiel's strategy.<br/><br/>One chapter argues that ""<i>Success is not just luck</i>"", mostly on the back of the existence of serially successful entrepreneurs (it is plausible that once could be luck, and plausible that one success brings massive funding, deserved or not. It isn't plausible that someone could dumbly blunder into 3 billion-dollar executions, even given the easy ride for the second and third). It pains me slightly to admit the latter, because it tints <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2521302674?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1"">my otherwise complete loathing of Steve Jobs</a>.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>Misc notes</b><br/><br/>* He notes that the term ""developed nations"" is a sign of our lack of ambition, of a premature, smug, quasi-willed halt.<br/><br/>* The dot-com boom was even crazier than you thought:<br/><blockquote><i>A South Korean firm wired us $5 million without first negotiating a deal or signing any documents. When I tried to return the money, they wouldn't tell me where to send it.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>* It is not yet clear whether killing Gawker was good or bad. Either way, like his Trump donation, you must acknowledge the sheer gall and direction.<br/><br/>* One should do a Straussian (between-the-lines) reading of anyone smart, conservative and public, because there will be a lot that's unsayable. I don't care to.<br/><blockquote><i>The few who knew what could be learned, <br/>Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show, <br/>reveal their feelings to the crowd below? <br/>These we have always crucified and burned.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>* Actually hold on. The man's a transhumanist, an anti-school radical, a funder of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasteading#The_Seasteading_Institute"">one of our only</a> large-scale experiments in urban planning or libertarianism, a rationalist. Why do we call him a conservative? <br/><br/>---<br/><br/><br/>Short, original, modest, and he credits his ghostwriter on the cover. Minus one point because it makes 200 large claims in 200 pages and has no citations for anything.<br/><br/><br><br/><br/>* Thinking about it, it's not so much that he avoids cliche, as that the erudite context defangs them.<br/>""Zero to One"" sounds like the usual kind of motivational crap, except that it's actually a good illustration of his maxim of creative monopoly (""0 -> 1 is much, much better than 1 -> n""). And the subtitle ""How to build the future"" is not figurative and not petty: he cites Bostrom's trajectories about the ultimate fate of the universe - and is only focussed on technology because that's what will get us past the Rise and Fall trap, the stagnation trap and the extinction trap.",,,1,0

The Corsican freedom fighters, the mob, the fucked-up Jacobins, and the Thermidorians each broke France, creating a ladder of corpses for people like Boney. (This feat is repeated by psychos in most revolutions.) He made general at 26 through an unearned political appointment, and was given absolute command of 63,000 men soon after. <br/><br/>Dwyer is out to get Napoleon: he sees propaganda everywhere (even in Boney's private diary, aged 18). The whole book is obsessed with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism"">Construction</a> of Napoleon - for instance, did you know that when he won a battle, <i>he told people about it expecting praise</i>?  This sentence, or its proposition, is repeated more than a hundred times:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    This encounter [with a prostitute] is taken by most historians at face value, but it is entirely possible that the account is fictional, nothing more than a fanciful exercise of the pen.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>    Of course it's possible, but so what? What is its probability? (I continue to read nonfiction which isn't data-driven - more fool me, I suppose.) It's weird to feel annoyed by the hypercritical spirit; I'm usually on the other side of this fence. <br/><br/>Dwyer is at least jargon-free. And Napoleon certainly lies all the time - to his rivals, his friends, and to posterity. An odd case: both genius and fraud - a genius of dishonesty. (Like Edison?)<br/><br/>Much of this long book is just a prose list of events, many of them insignificant (not to say prurient).

Fine as reference work maybe.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><i>Misc:</i> <br/><br/>* I knew that standing armies of the day were rammed full of pillagers, rapists, and thieves, but I was surprised to find that their generals were little better - Napoleon extracted about 80 million francs (maybe half a billion dollars?) from the Italians he conquered, under the name ""requisitions"". <br/>(This is many times the tax rate of the previous Austrian occupiers.)<br/><br/>* The many portraits of N are comically dissimilar - simply because done by artists who had never seen him or any image of him.   <br/><br/>* His romantic insecurity is also surprising: he writes to Josephine much more than she replies, and is constantly crestfallen to find her gone without saying where.<br/><br/>* ""<a href=""https://jacobinmag.com/"">Jacobin</a>"" is a terrible choice of name for a social justice magazine. It's more like ""Khmer Rouge Weekly"" or ""the Daily Witchfinder"" than anything laudable: <a href=""https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=30EEq8R2feIC&pg=PA617&dq=40000+reign+of+terror&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSgYOtyongAhUkrXEKHUuUBZoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=40000&f=false"">~40,000</a> executed or left to rot and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_the_Vend%C3%A9e"">a hundred thousand in the Vendée</a>, mostly religious peasants, <i>as well as</i> atrocities like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drownings_at_Nantes"">mass slow drownings</a>). The Jacobins deserve some share of Napoleon's millions of dead too - for all that N was only pretending to be a Jacobin. <br/><br/>Of course, the revolution nominally ended feudalism, redistributed land, and claimed to establish human rights. But we know in hindsight that this could have been done without killing 1% of the country and 0.6% of everyone alive - for instance, it was in Britain, and it was by earlier and later French republicans. So you got some nicer rhetoric in exchange for millions of gallons of blood.       <br/><br/>It suits me to call the Jacobins a perversion of the Enlightenment. This has <a href=""https://quillette.com/2018/03/11/steven-pinkers-counter-counter-enlightenment/"">lately been characterised</a> as a trick - if it's wrong for <i>Jacobin</i> to cherry-pick the bits they like about the Jacobins (anger, radicalisation, protest marches, beautiful lip-service to egalitarianism) then it's wrong for me to say they're not really part of 'the Enlightenment'.

More than half of this is about brain training, which has unfortunately lost most of its scientific veneer in the five years since it was published.

To some extent this is not his fault - I did n-back for a while myself in 2013, and he cites all the top people (he's in love with credentials and committee memberships). But the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis"">crisis</a> made a mockery of many top people. They crowed about lifting the 'curse of learning specificity' (that no training regime seems to produce a general increase in fluid intelligence). The curse has since reasserted its gloom. <br/><br/>He makes dozens of errors of interpretation (for instance, the Abecedarian preschool programme which he enthuses about made no long-term intelligence gains; for instance not distinguishing active and passive controls). And he gives no attention to the biggest interventions, quality sleep and education (<a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618774253"">3 points per year</a>(!)). Also, music instruction for cognition didn't replicate. <br/><br/>Serves me right for reading a journalist on any topic but journalism, I suppose. He gives, I think, only one effect size, despite citing hundreds of studies in prose. There's only one moment where he does actual journalism and pushes back against the hasty commercialisation of immature science. <br/><br/>Useful as an example of how not to write about science; about the spurious <a href=""https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/03/03/more-on-replication-crisis/"">omnicausal</a> implications of low-power psychology studies; as a reminder that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence (and anything nonmedical to do with <i>Gf</i> gains is extraordinary); and maybe if you're interested in verbatim conference backbiting.<br/><br/>His self-experiment is invalidated before it starts (even as an <i>n</i>-of-one thing) because he decides to wake up early (again, the cognitive penalty of 2 fewer hours of sleep dwarfs the boosters' estimates of brain training + exercise + nicotine):<br/><blockquote><i>I... wrote out my training schedule. I would wake up at 6:00 a.m. instead of my usual 8:00 a.m.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>His lowest moment: Trying to understand the balance of evidence about brain training and <i>g</i>, Hurley's meta-analytic method is to literally count the studies that found, or didn't find, a significant effect:<br/><blockquote><i>In the years following publication [of the original n-back study], a grand total of four randomized, controlled studies have been published finding no benefit of cognitive training... Yet in contrast, by my count, seventy-five other randomized, controlled studies have now been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals confirming that cognitive training substantially improves.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>He tries to critique the 2013 meta-analysis, but is unable to, because he doesn't know how to estimate study quality, and crapness matters <i>far</i> more than quantity.<br/><br/>How to avoid finding ourselves in Hurley's position? Well, first off avoid writing a book about any young social science (<i>n</i>-back was 11 years old when he wrote this so the rule might have to be ""more than a couple of decades old""). The lack of consensus (in a relatively nonpoliticised field) is another warning sign: not because science is quick at resolving bullshit disagreements, but because it means the effects can't be very large, are hiding in <a href=""https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2015/04/21/feather-bathroom-scale-kangaroo/"">the background noise</a>. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogmed"">surprisingly large</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumosity"">amounts of money</a> the findings spurred probably didn't help with confirmation bias and hostility. Listen to the grumpy bastards (Randy Engle, mocked as a ""defender of the [specificity] faith"" in this, was right all along). Lastly, <i>read the methodologists</i>: <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.200.7648&rep=rep1&type=pdf"">Paul Meehl</a> and others were warning us of the general statistical shoddiness of psychology more than forty years ago.<br/><br/>It's an important topic and he actually navigates the tricky nicotine vs tobacco literature well (spoiler: <a href=""https://www.gwern.net/Nicotine"">it's really good</a>).

""No human being has the right to punish another for not observing his religious duties. Only Allah can do that.""<br/><br/>It was like Quran school, but more intelligent. We even talked about martyrdom. My father said that committing suicide for Holy War was acceptable only in the time of the Prophet—and then only because the unbelievers had attacked the Prophet first. Today there could not be a Holy War, he said, because only the Prophet Muhammad could call for a Holy War.<br/><br/>This was my father's Islam: a mostly nonviolent religion that was his own interpretation of the Prophet's words. It relied on one's own sense of right and wrong, at least to some degree. It was more intelligent than the Islam I had learned from the ma'alim, and it was also far more humane. Still, this version of Islam also left me with unanswered questions and a sense of injustice: Why was it that only women needed to ask permission from their husband to leave the house, and not the other way round?<br/><br/>My father's Islam was also clearly an interpretation of what the Prophet said. As such, it was not legitimate. You may not interpret the will of Allah and the words of the Quran: it says so, right there in the book. There is a read-only lock. It is forbidden to pick and choose: you may only obey. The Prophet said, ""I have left you with clear guidance; no one deviates from it after me, except that he shall he destroyed."" A fundamentalist would tell my father, ""The sentence 'Only the Prophet can call a Holy War' is not in the Quran. You're putting it in there. That is blasphemy.""<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>: Did you notice it? She yields the entire ground to the fundamentalists. She's a literalist! She notes, correctly, that the Quran forbids interpretation, forbids reformation, and gives up. Never mind that almost all religious people live extremely flexibly with the demands of their religion, ""failing"" at this and adapting that. Never mind that, contrary to the Word, there's loads of Islams, that some majority-Muslim countries have been electing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto"">women</a> for ages, that some <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/17/female-genital-mutilation-banned-somalia"">Muslim</a> <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/tomorrow/genital-mutilation-in-egypt-stop-taking-your-daughters-to-be-mutilated-a-1199322.html"">governments</a> have been trying to stop FGM for a while now.

Gradients of bliss can suffice both to motivate us and offer a rich network of feedback mechanisms; so alas today do gradients of Darwinian discontent.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>On what science is for, on the very most we could aim for.<br/><br/>Late one evening, early one morning, I realised that I was not reading a crank on the internet. I'm not sure what exactly tipped me off: the page was called <i>The Abolition of Suffering; the Naturalisation of Heaven</i>. Maybe the extensive and thoughtful series of <a href=""https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon4.htm#objections"">responses to objections</a>. Not as late as the heart-stopping <i><a href=""https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon2.htm#alone"">Alone Amongst the Zombies</a></i>. Or the mixture of staggering ambition with modesty: <br/><blockquote><i><br/>         As hedonic engineering develops into a mature biomedical discipline, the generic modes of paradise we opt for can be genetically pre-coded... The innovative, high-specification bio-heavens beyond will be far richer. We lack the semantic competence to talk about them sensibly. Yet however inelegantly our goal may be accomplished at first, the ultimate strategic objective should be the neurochemical precision-engineering of happiness for every sentient organism on the planet.<br/><br/>         Sounds flaky? Yes, but then so, originally, has almost every radical reform movement in history (including, of course, the genuinely flaky ones.) </i><br/></blockquote><br/>and philosophy with biochemistry. It is difficult to return to what you were studying - mealy-mouthed, apologist, naturalistic-fallacious bioconservative bioethics - after that.<br/><br/>I hadn't considered wild-animal suffering before, the giant and at-best-ignored horror it is. People are at last starting to work on this, but Pearce was there decades ago. We have a long way to go before people <a href=""https://www.peta.org/about-peta/why-peta/predator-reintroduction-programs/"">stop making it worse</a> even.<br/><br/>More than {Singer, Ord, LessWrong}, Pearce set me on my way with an ideal ethics, which led quickly to effective altruism and AI safety. I'm not a negative utilitarian like him, but unlike <a href=""http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/negative-utilitarianism/#refs"">almost everyone else</a> I take that challenge seriously. <br/><br/>I've met half a dozen people whose lives he affected this strongly, but the nonacademic setting limits his status.<br/><br/>(The published collection <i><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Biotechnology-Abolish-Suffering-David-Pearce-ebook/dp/B075MV9KS2"">Can Biotechnology Abolish Suffering?</a></i> is better, newer, covering more ground.

I called <i>Superintelligence</i> the most rigorous exploration of the nonreal I had ever read: this beats it by a lot. You will find yourself reading pages on the properties of coolant pipes and be utterly engrossed. It is imaginary sociology, imaginary economics, <i>real</i> fiction. <br/><br/>(But it lacks an ethnography entirely: no em speaks to us themselves.)<br/><br/>People tend to wrap <i>Age of Em</i> in ulterior motives and esoteric intentions, because they love it but see futurism as an unworthy goal for such an achievement. I am no different: this is the greatest compendium of real social science I have ever found.<br/><br/>No review can do much justice, but here's one particularly hair-raising point in it: Hanson surveys the whole course of human history, and notes the many ways our culture is unprecedented and, in the evolutionary sense, nonadaptive:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>we live in the brief but important “dreamtime” when delusions [drive] history.  Our descendants will remember our era as the one where the human capacity to sincerely believe crazy non-adaptive things, and act on those beliefs, was dialed to the max.<br/><br/>Why is our era so delusory?<br/><br/>    <ol><br/><li>Our knowledge has been growing so fast, and bringing such radical changes, that many of us see anything as possible, so that nothing can really be labeled delusion.</li><br/><br/><li>    Rich folks like us have larger buffers of wealth to cushion our mistakes; we can live happily and long even while acting on crazy beliefs.</li><br/><br/><li>    We humans evolved to signal various features of ourselves to one another via delusions; we usually think that the various things we do to signal are done for other reasons.  For example, we think we pay for docs to help our loved ones get well, rather than to show that we care.  We think we do politics because we want to help our nation, rather than to signal our character and loyalty.  We are overconfident in our abilities in order to convince others to have confidence in us, and so on.  But while our ancestors’ delusions were well adapted to their situations, and so didn’t hurt them much, the same delusions are not nearly as adapted to our rapidly changing world; our signaling induced delusions hurt us more.</li><br/><br/><li>    Humans seem to have evolved to emphasize signaling more in good times than in bad.  Since very few physical investments last very long, the main investments one can make in good times that last until bad times are allies and reputation. So we are built to, in good times, spend more time and energy on leisure, medicine, charity, morals, patriotism, and so on.  Relative to our ancestors’ world, our whole era is one big very good time.</li><br/><br/><li>    Our minds were built with a near mode designed more for practical concrete reasoning about things up close, and a far mode designed more for presenting a good image to others via our abstract reasoning about things far away.  But our minds must now deal with a much larger world where many relevant things are much further away, and abstract reasoning is more useful.  So we rely more than did our ancestors on that abstract far mode capability.  But since that far mode was tuned more for presenting a good image, it is much more tolerant of good-looking delusions.</li><br/><br/><li>    Tech now enables more exposure to mood-altering drugs and arts, and specialists make them into especially potent “super-stimuli.”... today drugs are cheap, we can hear music all the time, most surfaces are covered by art, and we spend much of our day with stories from TV, video games, etc.  And all that art is made by organized groups of specialists far better than the typical ancestral artist.</li><br/><br/><li>    We were built to be influenced by the rhetoric, eloquence, difficulty, drama, and repetition of arguments, not just their logic.  Perhaps this once helped us to ally us with high status folks.  And we were built to show our ideals via the stories we like, and also to like well-crafted stories.  But today we are exposed to arguments and stories by folks far more expert than found in ancestral tribes.  Since we are built to be quite awed and persuaded by such displays, our beliefs and ideals are highly influenced by our writers and story-tellers.  And these folks in turn tell us what we want to hear, or what their patrons want us to hear, neither of which need have much to do with reality.<br/></li></ol><br/><br/>These factors combine to make our era the most consistently and consequentially deluded and unadaptive of any era ever.  When they remember us, our distant descendants will be shake their heads at the demographic transition, where we each took far less than full advantage of the reproductive opportunities our wealth offered.  They will note how we instead spent our wealth to buy products we saw in ads that talked mostly about the sort of folks who buy them.  They will lament our obsession with super-stimuli that highjacked our evolved heuristics to give us taste without nutrition.   They will note we spent vast sums on things that didn’t actually help on the margin, such as on medicine that didn’t make us healthier, or education that didn’t make us more productive.<br/><br/>Our descendants will also remember our adolescent and extreme mating patterns, our extreme gender personalities, and our unprecedentedly fierce warriors.  They will be amazed at the strange religious, political, and social beliefs we acted on, and how we preferred a political system, democracy, designed to emphasize the hardly-considered fleeting delusory thoughts of the median voter rather than the considered opinions of our best experts.<br/><br/>Perhaps most important, our descendants may remember how history hung by a precarious thread on a few crucial coordination choices that our highly integrated rapidly changing world did or might have allowed us to achieve, and the strange delusions that influenced such choices.  These choices might have been about global warming, rampaging robots, nuclear weapons, bioterror, etc.  Our delusions may have led us to do something quite wonderful, or quite horrible, that permanently changed the options available to our descendants.  This would be the most lasting legacy of this, our explosively growing dream time, when what was once adaptive behavior with mostly harmless delusions become strange and dreamy unadaptive behavior, before adaptation again reasserted a clear-headed relation between behavior and reality.<br/><br/>Our dreamtime will be a time of legend, a favorite setting for grand fiction, when low-delusion heroes and the strange rich clowns around them could most plausibly have changed the course of history.  Perhaps most dramatic will be tragedies about dreamtime advocates who could foresee and were horrified by the coming slow stable adaptive eons, and tried passionately, but unsuccessfully, to prevent them.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>It's easy to read a radical critique of our liberal values in there, but I believe him when he says that he doesn't dislike dreamtime; he just predicts it cannot last, because we are fighting an old and inexorable tide.<br/><br/>There are several thoughts this large, and a thousand other small insights in <i>Age of Em</i>.",,,1,0

How can it be that we are both 1) a rabidly overconfident species <i>and</i> 2) an extremely pessimistic species that generally gets these simple, objective questions very wrong (doing far worse than random)? Sure, we could just be dogmatic nihilists or idiots, but that doesn't fit that well. <br/><blockquote><i>A stunning 15% of humans managed to pick the wrong answer on all twelve questions. That’s almost impossible for a monkey to achieve. It requires systematic misconceptions. The problem here is not the lack of correct knowledge. The problem is the presence of wrong “knowledge”. To score this bad requires a false perception of the world, that make you pick the wrong answer systematically.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>Rosling explains it in terms of cognitive biases: we suffer from a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic""><i>dramatic</i></a> worldview, binarised, conflict-obsessed, and blamey. <br/><br/>People seem to find Development - the completely unprecedented explosion of survival, freedom, and dignity for the larger part of the entire world! - boring. (You could blame the media, but Rosling persuasively argues that they too are an epiphenomenon of our evolved fear and narrowness.)<br/><blockquote><i>Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from <a href=""https://www.gapminder.org/topics/four-income-levels/"">Level 4</a> [the top 10% of global income]; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. <br/><br/>When you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 3, 2, and 1 can look equally poor, and the word poor can lose any specific meaning... Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small... It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>On the shocking lack of empiricism even in the most important places like medicine and policy:<br/><blockquote><i>In the 1960s, the success of the recovery position inspired new public health advice, against most traditional practices, to put babies to sleep on their tummies... Even though the data showed that sudden infant deaths went up, not down, it wasn’t until 1985 that a group of pediatricians in Hong Kong actually suggested that the prone position might be the cause. Even then, doctors in Europe didn’t pay much attention. It took Swedish authorities another seven years to accept their mistake and reverse the policy...<br/><br/>With my own hands, over a decade or so, I turned many babies from back to tummy to prevent <br/>suffocation and save lives. So did many other doctors and parents throughout Europe and the United <br/>States, until the advice was finally reversed, 18 months after the Hong Kong study was published. <br/>Thousands of babies died because of a sweeping generalization, including some during the months <br/>when the evidence was already available. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><blockquote><i>Two hundred ninety-two brave young feminists had traveled to Stockholm from across the world to coordinate their struggle to improve women's access to education. But only 8 percent knew that 30-year-old women have spent on average only one year less in school than 30-year-old men.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Bad incentives and noble lies are another reason for the stubborn gloom of intellectuals:<br/><blockquote><i>There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women's education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Relentlessly sensible:<br/><blockquote><i>resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>I've been studying Development for years and this still taught me plenty. It should shock you into awareness and hopefully more.<br/><blockquote><i>Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem, and therefore save many fewer lives. This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources. It is hard for people to talk about resources when it comes to saving lives, or prolonging or improving them Doing so is often taken for heartlessness. Yet so long as resources are not infinite—and they never are infinite—it is the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>One of the ""<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/68316850?shelf=worldview-in-five-books"">five books that represent my worldview</a>"": moral passion, strict empiricism, psychological depth, existential hope. I picked this rather than <i>Enlightenment Now</i> or <i>Rational Optimist</i> or <i>Doing Good Better</i> or <i>Our World In Data</i> or <i>Whole Earth Discipline</i> (out of the contemporary literature of progress) because it also covers heuristics and biases - and so substitutes / complements Kahneman, Taleb, Hanson, and Yudkowsky, without (what people insist on seeing as) their self-superior wonkishness.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>Thank you industrialization, thank you steel mill, thank you power station, thank you chemical-processing industry, for giving us the time to read books. </blockquote></i><br/><br/>In a sense he stays on the surface - this isn't the full radical evolutionary account of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820444-the-elephant-in-the-brain""><i>Elephant in the Brain</i></a>, instead just noting some bad epistemic practices and gesturing at evolutionary theory. But that said, there's a ""charity is not about helping"" bit:<br/><blockquote><i>If I check the World Wildlife Fund I can see how, despite declines in some local populations, the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. It was worth paying for all those pandas stickers on the doors all around Stockholm. Yet only 6% of the Swedish public knows that their support has had any effect.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>But despite all the suffering and error and backfiring efforts he describes, he is trying to make you realise how good things could be:<br/><blockquote><i>Could everyone have a fact-based worldview one day? Big change is always difficult to imagine. But it is definitely possible, and I think it will happen, for two simple reasons. First: a fact-based worldview is more useful for navigating life, just like an accurate GPS is more useful for finding your way in the city. Second, and probably more important: a fact-based worldview is more comfortable. It creates less stress and hopelessness than the dramatic worldview, simply because the dramatic one is so negative and terrifying. <br/><br/>When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems— and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better. </blockquote></i><br/><br/>This, then, is the same message as <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World?ac=1&from_search=true"">Sagan</a>, 25 years ago: the emotional gain of reason. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>Misc notes</b><br/><br/>- Binary categories are often unhelpful because they obscure continuum. Rosling ranted against ""developed"" / ""developing"" for 20 years. The World Bank has caught on but the UN haven't.<br/><br/>- He is a better messenger for the cognitive bias alarm, for activists anyway, because of his deep credibility: he mucked in to anti-poverty measures for decades. Some of his anecdotes are chilling.<br/><blockquote><i>I could tell you countless stories of the nonsense I saw in Cuba: the local moonshine, a toxic fluorescent concoction brewed inside TV tubes using water, sugar, and babies’ poopy diapers to provide the yeast required for fermentation; the hotels that hadn’t planned for any guests and so had no food, a problem we solved by driving to an old people’s home and eating their leftovers from the standard adult food rations; my Cuban colleague who knew his children would be expelled from <br/>university if he sent a Christmas card to his cousin in Miami; the fact that I had to explain my research methods to Fidel Castro personally to get approval. I will restrain myself and just tell you why I was there and what I discovered. </blockquote></i><br/><br/>- ""<i>I do not believe that fake news is the major culprit for our distorted worldview: we haven’t only just started to get the world wrong, I think we have always gotten it wrong.</i>""<br/><br/>- ""<i>In the car industry, cars are recalled when a mistake is discovered. You get a letter from the manufacturer saying, “We would like to recall your vehicle and replace the brakes.” When the facts about the world that you were taught in schools and universities become out of date, you should get a letter too: “Sorry, what we taught you is no longer true.

When you’re really into music, you get into it, and you end up having these weird appreciations, like Kurt had – you might end up thinking that what to everyone else is a forgotten one-hit wonder deserves consideration with the rest of the greats. And you might look at the Pixies and decide they’re one of the greats, too, but when you come at it just having heard that they are great, then you’re not into it, and you don’t end up with a real love, just an appreciation. It’s why a fan of, you know, Mudhoney or...Pearl Jam’s going to be more passionate, because they’ve got something to prove. You haven’t got anything to prove, because you’ve never come to it that way.” – this is actually going really well.

St Aubyn is the preferred comparator - of the inability to really control oneself, of moral luck and lack of luck.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>DOUGAL:	Why did you shoot the horse?<br/>SOOTY:		[She] made me.

This undermines his claim that inequality is now as bad as it was in the early 1900s: when tax codes change dramatically, as they did through the pre-war period and in 1986, the data become unrepresentative (without adjustment). After adjustment, it looks like inequality fell much less in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion"">postwar boom</a> and has risen much less, post-80s.<br/>* <a href=""http://mattrognlie.com/piketty_diminishing_returns.pdf"">Rognlie</a> and <a href=""https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/spowpecon/info_3ahdl_3a2441_2f30nstiku669glbr66l6n7mc2oq.htm"">Bonnet et al</a>: Piketty calculated the increase in capital share wrong, it's a lot lower; price appreciation (benefiting the rich) is not general, instead driven by housing. This mostly benefits single-home-owners, who use their capital by living in it, and so aren't 'rentiers'; thus Piketty is mostly wrong about the rise of rentier capitalism. Also, housing shortages are often political rather than fundamental, which again undermines the big anti-capital policy implication. <br/>* <a href=""http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/teaching/FurmanOrszag15.pdf"">Furman and Orszag</a>: Piketty's explanation for extreme income disparities (: large increases in corporate-executive bargaining power) isn't right; instead only a small group of monopolistic tech firms (""superstars"") display this.  <br/>* <a href=""https://economics.mit.edu/files/11348"">Acemoglu and Robinson</a>: The evidence is mostly strongly against his three fundamental laws of capitalism. Most importantly, the elasticity of substitution of capital for labour is less than one; therefore, Piketty's main mechanism for explaining inequality cannot be true.<br/>* <a href=""http://www.deirdremccloskey.org/docs/pdf/PikettyReviewEssay.pdf"">McCloskey</a>: lots of errors.<br/><br/>Piketty's core claims:<blockquote><br/>1. the capital share of national income has risen (at the expense of labour share).<br/>2. <i>r > g</i>; wealth generally grows faster than economic output.<br/>3. whenever <i>r > g</i>, inequality will rise because capital gets concentrated in fewer hands. <br/>3b. <i>r</i> (the return to capital) won't change much in response to a decline in growth rate, because the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is high.<br/>4. The capital-output ratio will be worse in the future.<br/>5. Therefore large wealth tax now, or both capitalism and democracy will die. <br/></blockquote><br/>The above research finds that the first is true in some places (in the UK, the US and Canada?), but each of the middle three is questionable. (4) could happen but we're not given much reason to think it inevitable. Summary: Piketty's data collection and descriptive work is mostly good, his analysis and modelling is flawed enough to undo his policy recommendations (5).<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>The resentful econ undergrad in me thrilled to see Piketty saying this:<br/> <blockquote><i>To put it bluntly, the discipline of economics has yet to get over its childish passion for mathematics and for purely theoretical and often highly ideological speculation, at the expense of historical research and collaboration with the other social sciences. Economists are all too often preoccupied with petty mathematical problems of interest only to themselves. This obsession with mathematics is an easy way of acquiring the appearance of scientificity without having to answer the far more complex questions posed by the world we live in. There is one great advantage of being an academic economist in France: here, economists are not highly respected in the academic and intellectual world or by political and financial elites. Hence they must set aside their contempt for other disciplines and their absurd claim to greater scientific legitimacy, despite the fact that they know almost nothing about anything.</i></blockquote> <br/><br/> He's keen to emphasise his ideological hygiene, that he's a real-deal empiricist. Weighed down by overstatement of its own achievement (“the fundamental laws of capitalism”). <br/><br/>With a few more diagrams and boxed definitions, this would make an excellent intro macro textbook, gentle and empirically obsessive as it is. Lot of redundancy - whoa-there steady-now summary paragraphs every few pages - but I suppose that's what you need to do if you aim to be understood by policymakers.",,,2,0

Why we recoil from the dull. Maybe it’s because dullness is intrinsically painful; maybe that’s where phrases like ‘deadly dull’ and ‘excruciatingly dull’ come from. But there might be more to it. Maybe dullness is associated with psychic pain because something that’s dull fails to provide enough stimulation to distract people from some other, deeper type of pain that is always there, if only in an ambient low-level way… I can’t think anyone really believes that today’s so-called ‘information society’ is just about information.

The Jonesian Establishment consists of: fiscally conservative think tanks (but not powerful fiscally liberal ones); Old Boy MPs (but not originally working-class ones, however much they use the same revolving doors); the news media (but not himself, with <a href=""https://twitter.com/OwenJones84?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"">500,000</a> followers); the police; all corporate bosses; anything to do with the City. <br/><br/>This is only a problem because of his choice of term, which implies that his description covers all the powerful in Britain. (A big omission, for instance, are the unions. Unite and Unison have extremely <a href=""https://www.lgcplus.com/prime-minister-restores-tuc-meetings/1501606.article"">frequent</a> meetings with the most powerful politicians in the country - quite rightly - and have an incredibly strong role in <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/unite-union-boss-len-mccluskey-threatens-to-launch-party-to-rival-labour-9231266.html"">selecting some of those people</a> - quite dubiously. They sometimes use this power against the public interest, e.g. GMB propping up Trident. But they are not Establishment to Jones.*) <br/><br/>He is thinking clearly, and that's half the work in finding the truth, which is half the work in changing the world. But, above the level of reporting individual events, he is just not empirically reliable: he notes that the <i>Sun</i> has 3m readers and just assumes that this means they are all-powerful in elections. Actually the (British, C21st) media has <a href=""http://www.city.ac.uk/news/2015/april/newspapers-influence-election"">little effect</a> on election outcomes - <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.570.64&rep=rep1&type=pdf"">they produce only</a> <a href=""http://users.ox.ac.uk/~chri3110/Details/Sun%20paper.pdf"">1-2% swings</a>.**<br/><br/>A more general problem: Jones has a fundamentally <i>moral</i> conception of society's problems: ""the poor primarily suffer because of the greed or cowardice or ignorance of our rulers. Nationalisations and the £20 minimum wage would have no real downside."" This is as opposed to the engineering conception, which sees the constraints, tradeoffs, and tries to design solutions with these in mind.<br/><br/>Still, my sympathies are with people who get attacked on both sides of a war, as Jones often does - for being both naively idealistic about economics and democracy, <i>and</i> insufficiently radical and obedient to the party line. He bears some millstones, like his totally unanalysed use of the Left/Right divide (he prefaces every single bloody interview with bloody anyone with a binary tag, one way or the other).<br/><br/>Anyway this is fine as very recent political history. (If you were paying attention to politics during the Noughties, then you maybe won't learn much new here, but it's a great primer for the foreign or young.)

(Or, it was thirty years ago. They'll have invented thousands more ill-defined words since then.) I imagine it would also be good for very ambitious adult English learners.<br/><br/>Williams is a sarcastic, clever and friendly guide: I can't remember which top-rank word he describes as ""better for it never to have been"", but here's a good entry:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    'Nature' is perhaps the most complex word in the language. It is relatively easy to distinguish three areas of meaning: <br/><br/>(i) the essential quantity and character of something; <br/>(ii) the inherent force which directs either the world or human beings or both; <br/>(iii) the material world itself, taken as including or not including human beings. <br/><br/>Yet it is evident that within (ii) and (iii), though the area of reference is broadly clear, precise meanings are variable and at times even opposed. The historical development of the word through these three senses is important, but it is also significant that all three senses, and the main variations and alternatives within the two most difficult of them, are still active and widespread in contemporary usage. was (i), the essential character and quality of something. Nature is thus one of several important words, including culture, which began as descriptions of a quality or process, immediately defined by a specific reference, but later became independent nouns...<br/><br/>The common phrase <i>human nature</i>, often crucial in important kinds of argument, can contain, without clearly demonstrating it, any of the three main senses and indeed the main variations and alternatives. There is a relatively neutral use in sense (i): that it is an essential quality and characteristic of human beings to do something (though the something that is specified may of course be controversial). But in many uses the descriptive (and hence verifiable or falsifiable) character of sense (i) is less prominent than the very different kind of statement which depends on sense (ii), the directing inherent force, or one of the variants of sense (iii), a fixed property of the material world, in this case ‘natural man’. What has also to be noticed in the relation between sense (i) and senses (ii) and (iii) is, more generally, that sense (i), by definition, is a specific singular - the nature of something, whereas senses (ii) and (iii), in almost all their uses, are abstract singulars - the nature of all things having become singular nature or Nature...<br/><br/>There was then a practice of shifting use, as in Shakespeare’s Lear: <br/><br/><blockquote>Allow not nature more than nature needs, <br/>Man’s life’s as cheap as beast’s ... <br/>one daughter / Who redeems nature from the general curse <br/>Which twain have brought her to. <br/>That nature, which contemns its origin <br/>Cannot be border’d certain in itself... <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>It could seem wrong to inquire into the workings of an absolute monarch, or of a minister of God. But a formula was arrived at: to understand the creation was to praise the Creator, seeing absolute power through contingent works. In practice the formula became lip-service and was then forgotten. Paralleling political changes, nature was altered from an absolute to a constitutional monarch, with a new kind of emphasis on natural laws. Nature, in C18 and C19, was often in effect personified as a constitutional lawyer. The laws came from somewhere, and this was variously but often indifferently defined; most practical attention was given to interpreting and classifying the laws, making predictions from precedents, discovering or reviving forgotten statutes, and above all shaping new laws from new cases: nature not as an inherent and shaping force but as an accumulation and classification of cases. <br/><br/>The complexity of the word is hardly surprising, given the fundamental importance of the processes to which it refers. But since nature is a word which carries, over a very long period, many of the major variations of human thought - often, in any particular use, only implicitly yet with powerful effect on the character of the argument - it is necessary to be especially aware of its difficulty.<br/></blockquote></i>",,,1,0

It works because of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrakis"">the loveable setting</a> and its thrilling ecosystem; the sharp, rapid dialogue; its sheer, smushy pastiche of human history (American environmentalism, medieval feudalism, Arabic sheikism, and Zen martial hokum (""<i>he is a Zensunni prophet</i>"", ""<i>to use the family atomics</i>""); its mystical anti-<i>Star Trek</i> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism"">historical materialism</a>; excellent setpieces; and because the book contains a realist reading of its own magical-heroic events. (Here's a start: Everything takes place on a world made of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melange_(fictional_drug)"">shroom heroin</a>! You can't trust a thing these people say!)<br/><br/>This hidden realism is clearest in the (heavy) appendices to the book - these aren't the ordinary conceited footnotes of fantasy, which assume you care about its little world as much as the author does. They're instead a rationalist palate cleanser after 600 pages of woo. A scientific, academic register erupts, mocking the internally real mysticism of the foregoing. I was even a little disappointed to find a huge <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Dune_terminology"">glossary</a> at the end, containing all the words I had been puzzling over. Mystery and gnosis and not-quite-getting-it suits the plot. The appendices say the book is more than its plot, and the world more than its books.<br/><br/>(The big realist moment within the book is when you see that the great prophecy is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene_Gesserit#Missionaria_Protectiva"">just a scam</a>, planted to manipulate people.)<br/><br/>The baddies, the Harkonnens, are a bit much though: nothing they do is not repulsive. Herbert has the protagonists use mysticism and authoritarianism, while having most of the best characters resist and despise these things. There's no such tension with the main antagonists, no nominally redeeming feature. So you can feel Herbert hissing and booing the Harkonnens. Here is the <i>first</i> scene with the evil Baron:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    It was a relief globe of a world, partly in shadows, spinning under the impetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings... A chuckle sounded beside the globe. A basso voice rumbled out of the chuckle:<br> 'There it is, Piter, the biggest mantrap in all history. And the Duke's headed into its jaws. Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?'<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Herbert gets away with this because Harkonnen is supposed to be over-the-top, and, more, because his world has a <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality"">black and grey</a> morality. (Do you want the genocidal decadent rapist Machiavels or the square-chinned aristocratic Machiavels?)<br/><br/>The greyness of the Atreides leads to the biggest plot problem. (It's not exactly a plot hole, but it takes interpretive labour to make it make sense.): Paul's Jihad is unmotivated. Nobody wants it, including the Messiah it is carried out for. Paul even compares himself to Mega Hitler:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>'There's another emperor I want you to note in passing - a Hitler. He killed more than six million. Pretty good for those days.'<br/>'Killed by his legions?'<br/>'Yes.'<br/>'Not very impressive statistics, m'Lord.'<br/>'... at a conservative estimate, I've killed sixty-one billion, sterilised ninety planets... We'll be a hundred generations recovering from Muad'dib's jihad.'<br/></i></blockquote><br/>and it's implied that the previous tyrant, Padishah, did not do such things. This completely undermines the exciting and righteous revolution that we spent a book and a half cheering on. If unprecedented death and misery is the payoff, <i>what is the gain of having a noble ruler</i>?<br/><br/>OK, Paul frequently speaks of not being able to stop the jihad - scrying that, if he does try and stop it, he just gets usurped and then it carries on worse. But then he shouldn't have come to power at all, and the book tacitly tells us that things would have been better if the Harkonnens succeeded and none of the last three-quarters happened.<br/><br/>The way to make sense of this is to take Herbert's anti-hero line above seriously. Paul made a terrible situation worse. We're not supposed to root for him. But, Herbert knows, we can't help it, because Paul is the Underdog and Loyal and Smart and Competent and (obvs) dead handsome.<br/><br/><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-by8JNAIBYhc/WbW0uIcZgLI/AAAAAAAADH8/vcPFGJ3vvt8j71isQG8UfGtY59Gr4uX9gCLcBGAs/s1600/spice.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img data-original-height=""470"" data-original-width=""500"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-by8JNAIBYhc/WbW0uIcZgLI/AAAAAAAADH8/vcPFGJ3vvt8j71isQG8UfGtY59Gr4uX9gCLcBGAs/s640/spice.jpg"" width=""320"" height=""302"" border=""0""></a></div><br/><br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/><ul><br/><li>There's very good dialogue throughout, with some of the best lines given to an array of anonymous guards.

His <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-letters-ever-written/answer/Abhishek-Srivastava-317"">letter to his 10yo daughter</a> is maybe the clearest statement of sceptical empiricism ever, though it also displays the blithe wonkishness that alienates most people:<br/><blockquote><i>Suppose I told you that your dog was dead. You’d be very upset, and you’d probably say, ‘Are you sure? How do you know? How did it happen?’ Now suppose I answered: ‘I don’t actually know that Pepe is dead. I have no evidence. I just have this funny feeling deep inside me that he is dead.’ You’d be pretty cross with me for scaring you, because you’d know that an inside ‘feeling’ on its own is not a good reason for believing that a whippet is dead. You need evidence. We all have inside feelings from time to time, and sometimes they turn out to be right and sometimes they don’t. Anyway, different people have opposite feelings, so how are we to decide whose feeling is right? The only way to be sure that a dog is dead is to see him dead, or hear that his heart has stopped; or be told by somebody who has seen or heard some real evidence that he is dead.<br/><br/>People sometimes say that you must believe in your deep feelings inside, otherwise you’d never be confident of things like ‘My wife loves me’. But this is a bad argument. There can be plenty of evidence that somebody loves you. All through the day when you are with somebody who loves you, you see and hear lots of little tidbits of evidence, and they all add up. It isn’t purely inside feeling, like the feeling that priests call revelation. There are outside things to back up the inside feeling: looks in the eye, tender notes in the voice, little favors and kindnesses; this is all real evidence.</i></blockquote><br/>Aaag he used to be so wise and grand, giving out words to live by.

For an academic, his prose is highly flavoursome and fun. He has a considered opinion about Darwin's handwriting and the meaning of baseball. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_for_Brontosaurus"">One</a> of his essay collections was very important to me as a teen, showing me that I could unify truth-seeking and justice-seeking, and with style. <br/><br/>But this is all countermanded, because he is just <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/kv/beware_of_stephen_j_gould/"">not trustworthy</a> <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_earthling/1996/11/homo_deceptus.html"">on human</a> <a href=""http://www.umsl.edu/~carrolljc/Documents%20linked%20to%20indiex/IN_LIT_DAR/Critique_of_Gould.pdf"">topics</a>, and <a href=""http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/CEP_Gould.html"">neither on</a> core evolutionary theory, I'm told. From his enormously influential, fallacious dismissal of intelligence research in general and <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/science/14skull.html?_r=1"">Morton in particular</a>, to his dishonest coup of public discourse over punctuated equilibrium (pushing the flashy and revolutionary version in literary magazines, retreating to minimal and uncontentious forms in the science journals who could actually evaluate it), he muddied the waters even as he brandished real literary talent and noble political intentions. This is unforgiveable: empirical clarity is too rare and precious to sacrifice so. <br/><br/>Maynard Smith: <i><blockquote>Gould occupies a rather curious position, particularly on his side of the Atlantic. Because of the excellence of his essays, he has come to be seen by non-biologists as the preeminent evolutionary theorist. In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists. All this would not matter, were it not that he is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory.</i></blockquote><br/><a href=""http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/evolute.html"">Krugman</a>:<br/><i><blockquote>Gould is the John Kenneth Galbraith of his subject. That is, he is a wonderful writer who is beloved by literary intellectuals and lionized by the media because he does not use algebra or difficult jargon. Unfortunately, it appears that he avoids these sins not because he has transcended his colleagues but because he does does not seem to understand what they have to say; and his own descriptions of what the field is about - not just the answers, but even the questions - are consistently misleading. His impressive literary and historical erudition makes his work seem profound to most readers, but informed readers eventually conclude that there's no there there.</i></blockquote><br/>Tooby and Cosmides:<br/><i><blockquote>We suggest that the best way to grasp the nature of Gould's writings is to recognize them as one of the most formidable bodies of fiction to be produced in recent American letters. Gould brilliantly works a number of literary devices to construct a fictional ""Gould"" as the protagonist of his essays and to construct a world of ""evolutionary biology"" every bit as imaginary and plausible as Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. Most of the elements of Gould's writing make no sense if they are interpreted as an honest attempt to communicate about science (e.g., why would he characterize so many researchers as saying the opposite of what they actually do) but come sharply into focus when understood as necessary components of a world constructed for the fictional ""Gould"" to have heroic fantasy adventures in...<br/><br/> ""Gould"" the protagonist is a much loved character who reveals himself to be learned, subtle, open-minded, tolerant, funny, gracious to his opponents, a tireless adversary of cultural prejudice, able to swim upstream against popular opinion with unflinching moral courage, able to pierce the surface appearances that capture others, and indeed to be not only the most brilliant innovator in biology since Darwin, but more importantly to be the voice of humane reason against the forces of ignorance, passion, incuriousity, and injustice. The author Gould, not least because he labors to beguile his audience into confusing his fictional targets with actual people and fields, is sadly none of these things.<br/><br/>Yet in the final analysis, there are genuine grounds for hope in the immense and enduring popularity of Gould. Gould is popular, we think, because readers see in ""Gould"" the embodiment of humane reason, the best aspirations of the scientific impulse. It is this ""Gould"" that we will continue to honor, and, who, indeed, would fight to bring the illumination that modern evolutionary science can offer into wider use. </i></blockquote><br/>Here is a fictional leaf from Gould's <i>ad hominem</i> book, to give you a sense of what he does, at his worst:<br/><blockquote><i>Gould is famed for the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which holds that adaption and speciation is not generally a slow, gradual process measurable in tens of thousands of year periods, but instead a rapid response to environmental shocks, measurable in hundred-year periods. The political bias of this theory is too blatant to ignore: as a Marxist, Gould requires that sustainable change be possible by revolution rather than by long accumulation (...)</i></blockquote><br/>(For full effect I should now chide him for his genic panadaptationism.)<br/><br/>Along with Lewontin and Rose, Gould mediated a huge contradiction in our culture: they allowed the C20th left to feel we were scientific, in our comfortable blank-slatism. That we had already incorporated the deep challenge of evolutionary biology - since these eminent men told us it had no human implications. <br/><br/>Read Gould for fun and uplift, but take great care, for he cares about other things more than truth. (Read Midgley and Singer first if the politics scare you; they might stop you fleeing into Gould's dodgy arms.)<br/><br/>From James. The Leonardo and Columbus esays are 4/5.</li><br/>",,,1,0

(And contempt is a kind of involuntary respect.) Backwards analogy: Bukowski is Tom Waits minus gospel, minus FX pedals, minus Brecht and Weill, minus one steady Kathleen peer. And minus metre of course. A grumpy adolescent old man; a sensitising misanthrope; a beautiful lech.<br/><br/>He has only two modes: midnight countercultural raving and laconic woke-at-noon observation. Neither would work without his lecherousness and/or meanness and/or arrogance; they are the absolutely necessary breve before he blares out his concern.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>    moments of agony and moments of glory<br/>    march across my roof.<br/><br/>    the cat walks by<br/>    seeming to know everything.<br/><br/>    my luck has been better, I think,<br/>    than the luck of the cut gladiolus,<br/>    although I am not sure.<br/><br/>    I have been loved by many women,<br/>    and for a hunchback of life,<br/>    that’s lucky.<br/><br/>    so many fingers pushing through my hair<br/>    so many arms holding me close<br/>    so many shoes thrown carelessly on my bedroom<br/>    rug.<br/><br/>    so many searching hearts<br/>    now fixed in my memory that<br/>    i’ll go to my death,<br/>    remembering.<br/>    I have been treated better than I should have<br/>    been—<br/>    not by life in general<br/>    nor by the machinery of things<br/>    but by women.<br/><br/>    but there have been other women<br/>    who have left me<br/>    standing in the bedroom alone<br/>    doubled over—<br/>    hands holding the gut—<br/>    thinking<br/>    why why why why why why?<br/><br/>    women go to men who are pigs<br/>    women go to men with dead souls<br/>    women go to men who fuck badly<br/>    women go to shadows of men<br/>    women go<br/>    go<br/>    because they must go<br/>    in the order of<br/>    things.<br/><br/>    the women know better<br/>    but often chose out of<br/>    disorder and confusion.<br/><br/>    they can heal with their touch<br/>    they can kill what they touch and<br/>    I am dying<br/>    but not dead<br/>    yet.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>(That ^ might have gotten your back up, because it pattern-matches to modern whining about women's choices. But it isn't that: remember, from above, that he is calling himself a pig and a dead soul.)<br/><br/>This is three books written over thirty years, one sentence per ten lines as always, stapled together to give the impression of a late-life opus. It covers the whole lot: his Great Depression origin myth; his meaningless, crabbed middle years; and his long, long late period spent in contempt of the arty people who pay and applaud him.<br/><br/>I am nothing like him, except maybe in sense of humour. He is not anti-modern - grew up through the Great Depression, a simulation of pre-modern subsistence; loves shit cars; lives for late night recorded music - but science, growth, and the expanding circle give him nothing of the sense of direction, transcendence and hope that it gives to me and mine. But still I ""relate"", as the disgusting verb puts it.<br/><br/>I have read this a half-dozen times in a dozen years. (It isn't hard; it takes an hour.) I know of no better poet to <i>begin</i> to explain why poetry is good and unique and feeds life. This surely says something about my character, but I don't expect to stop reading it.<br/><br/><br> <br/>PS: Bukowski's epitaph is ""<i>Don't try</i>"". On the face of it that's mean and funny and fine, but it also means what Yoda means by it: Don't force it; Don't betray your nature; Do only what you are absolutely aligned behind. Is that good advice? Maybe not, but it is epitomises the man more than the nihilistic joke.<br/><br/><ul><li>    <a href=""https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/"">Galef type</a>:<br><br/><i>Values 3</i> - written from a holistic value structure, letting you experience that value structure from the inside.<br/></li>",,,1,0

A surgeon’s job was to arrest that centrifugal spread by cutting every piece of it out of the body, as if to catch and break the wheel in midspin. This meant treating early breast cancer aggressively and definitively. The more a surgeon cut, the more he cured.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>The sheer amount of money and genius thrown at cancer - <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/01/cancer-progress-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/"">with merely gradual returns</a> - is not really considered in terms of its opportunity cost, by Mukherjee of anyone - what diseases might we have cured with those hundreds of billions?

It's an attempt to borrow the prestige and consensus of the Green movement to push through all the expensive social policies she wanted anyway. <br/><br/>That sounds cynical, but she says as much right at the start of the book: <br/><blockquote><i>I was propelled into a deeper engagement with [environmentalism] partly because I realized it could be a catalyst for forms of social and economic justice in which I already believed... liberals are still averting their eyes, having yet to grasp that climate science has handed them the most powerful argument against unfettered capitalism since William Blake's 'dark Satanic Mills'</i></blockquote><br/>Here's what I think the central argument is (she never comes out and says it):<br/><blockquote>Climate change is an existential risk.<br/>Capitalism exacerbates climate change.<br/>Therefore change capitalism.</blockquote><br/><br/>But the subtitle's misleading; she constantly blurs the distinction between two theses: 1) 'solving the climate crisis will require regulation of the market', and 2) 'solving the climate crisis will require the abolition of capitalism' In most of this she doesn't endorse (2) at all - ""<i>there is plenty of room to make a profit in a zero-carbon economy</i>"" - and surprisingly she doesn't deny that <a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/armine-sahakyan/the-grim-pollution-pictur_b_9266764.html?guccounter=1"">communism</a> <a href=""https://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1990/09/ridgeway.html"">was worse</a> for the environment than the C20th Western system: <br/><blockquote><i>...the truth is that, while contemporary, hyper-globalized capitalism has exacerbated the climate crisis, it did not create it. We started treating the atmosphere as our waste dump when we began using coal on a commercial scale in the late 1700s and engaged in similarly reckless ecological practices well before that. Moreover, humans have behaved in this shortsighted way not only under capitalist systems, but under systems that called themselves socialist as well...</i></blockquote><br/>If you read closely enough you see her actual target is not capitalism but '<i>extractivism</i>', the (ancient!) tendency of people to exploit natural resources relentlessly.<br/><br/>The cause of extractivism is fatuously said to be the philosophical divide between mind and body, whence also science and the industrial revolution. This causation is ascertained in one line, with a vague citation to unnamed feminist scholars having ""recognised"" (by which she means conclusively demonstrated) this at some point (pp.177).<br/><br/>She's really good at generating urgency and panic: she calls anything that doesn't cut all 10 petagrams of emissions <i>right away</i> a ""failure"". And since it's a failure, therefore confront and block and yell. (Needless to say, activism can't make all the cuts in time either.)<br/><br/>She has a chapter on each of the non-political solutions: so she is sequentially anti-nuclear, anti-GM, anti-geoengineering, anti-<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading"">cap</a>, anti-<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax"">tax</a>, anti-<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/13/richard-branson-failed-climate-change-pledge"">Branson</a>, anti-'corporate reponsibility'. I suspect she's wrong about most of these. But she is most wrong on the matter of carbon pricing and <a href=""www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/09/naomi_klein_is_wrong_corporations_are_doing_more_than_governments_to_halt.html"">Big Green</a>. We need to stop <a href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/oecd-fossil-fuel-subsidies-373-billion-2015"">subsidising fossil fuels</a> (you can blame lobbying for those if you like, but this is still a massive government failure). And pricing is the best and least dangerous policy option.<br/><br/>In their stead she promotes ""planning and banning"" (vast micromanagement of allowed resources and technologies), divestment (which we know has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/17/why-fossil-fuel-divestment-is-a-misguided-tactic"">no long-term</a> <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-divestment-work"">effect</a> on public companies) and blockading machinery (which sorta works but at terrible human cost). She also wants North America to be more northern European, with<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    cheap public transit and clean light rail accessible to all: affordable, energy-efficient housing along those transit lines; cities planned for high-density living; bike lanes in which riders aren’t asked to risk their lives to get to work; land management that discourages sprawl and encourages local, low-energy forms of agriculture; urban design that clusters essential services like schools and health care along transit routes and in pedestrian-friendly areas; programs that require manufacturers to be responsible for the electronic waste their produce...</i></blockquote><br/>That's most evocative of the Netherlands. But their infrastructure was not born of mass politics, green or otherwise, but rather of high energy costs and low land per capita. <a href=""http://induecourse.ca/naomi-klein-this-changes-everything/"">Joseph Heath explains</a> that this cost difference<br/><blockquote><i>creates the demand for transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly cities, just like the electricity price creates the demand for efficient housing. This is what drives the style of planning that predominates in that country. You can do all the “planning” of urban development you want, but unless people actually want to live in the high-density houses you’re building, they will remain empty. The reason they are attractive to people in the Netherlands is that the alternatives are unattractive, largely because of the cost.<br/><br/>Given the impact that prices have on behaviour throughout the economy, it is clear that the ability to control prices is by far the most powerful policy lever that the state has in its possession. Thus the natural upshot of a wish-list like the one Klein presents is that the state should start to price the carbon externality generated through fossil-fuel consumption, through either a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax. And yet this is not what Klein recommends.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>Anyway the market is decarbonising. I would say that we have the benefit of the three years of progress since she wrote this, but the (capitalist) trend was clear back then too: <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-energy-consumption-by-region"">17% renewables</a> <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-energy-consumption-by-region"">growth per year</a>.<br/><br/><br/><a href=""http://rameznaam.com/2016/04/12/how-cheap-can-electric-vehicles-get/"">Electric cars are now cheaper to run than fossil ones</a> and the price curve is tending quickly and strongly down.<a href=""http://rameznaam.com/2015/08/10/how-cheap-can-solar-get-very-cheap-indeed/""> New-build solar power is now cheaper per megawatt than oil</a>, and the<a href=""http://rameznaam.com/2015/10/14/how-cheap-can-energy-storage-get/""> associated storage cells</a> for night are becoming cheaper even faster. These are both market developments (boosted by subsidies but more and more self-sustaining).<br/><br/>She has a long section on how having a child was the cause of her environmentalism - but she fails to reconcile this with the fact that having a child in the developed world is the <a href=""http://blogs.sps.ed.ac.uk/jwi/2017/09/20/if-having-children-is-bad-for-the-environment-what-should-parents-do-about-it/"">single most</a> <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378008001003"">significant environmental footprint</a> for an individual; it would take an extraordinary amount of work to just zero out this harm.<br/><br/>As economics this is shaky, and as politics unlikely, but she remains a good journalist. Where by journalist I mean 'person who works at the “These terrible unknown things are happening; here is what the people involved say. What might it mean?” level'. She also writes at the ""Here is the big picture and what to do about it"" level though, and honestly I recommend just walking right by those bits (pages 1 through 300).<br/><br/>Minus a point because it falsely maligns effective and politically available environment policies, and so has done expected harm. <br/><br/>Read <a href=""http://www.inference.org.uk/sustainable/book/tex/sewtha.pdf"">Mackay</a> and <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/renewables"">OWiD</a> instead.",,,1,0

Although  the  whole  point  of   the  participant  element  is  to  understand  the  culture  from  a  ‘native’ perspective, you must spend a good three pages explaining that your unconscious  ethnocentric  prejudices,  and  various  other  cultural  barriers,  probably  make  this  impossible.  It  is  then  customary  to  question  the  entire  moral  basis  of   the  observation  element,  and,  ideally,  to  express  grave  reservations  about  the  validity  of   modern  Western  ‘science’  as  a  means  of   understanding  anything  at  all. <br/><br/>At  this  point,  the  uninitiated  reader  might  legitimately  wonder  why  we  continue  to  use  a  research  method  that  is  clearly  either  morally  questionable  or  unreliable  or  both.  I  wondered  this  myself,  until I realised that these doleful recitations of  the dangers and evils of   participant  observation  are  a  form  of   protective  mantra,  a  ritual  chant  similar  to  the  rather  charming  practice  of   some  Native  American tribes who, before setting out on a hunt or chopping down a  tree,  would  sing  apologetic  laments  to  appease  the  spirits  of   the  animals  they  were  about  to  kill  or  the  tree  they  were  about  to  fell.  <br/><br/>A  less  charitable  interpretation  would  see  anthropologists’  ritual  self-abasements  as  a  disingenuous  attempt  to  deflect  criticism  by  pre-emptive confession of  their failings – like the selfish and neglectful lover  who  says,  ‘Oh,  I’m  such  a  bastard,  I  don’t  know  why  you  put  up  with  me,’  relying  on  our  belief   that  such  awareness  and  candid acknowledgement  of   a  fault  is  almost  as  virtuous  as  not  having  it.  <br/><br/>But whatever the motives, conscious or otherwise, the ritual chapter agonising   over   the   role   of    the   participant   observer   tends   to   be mind-numbingly tedious...<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>    Even with a style like that, this gets repetitive.

'Not really. Thirty thousand years ago, when men were doing cave paintings at Lascaux, they worked twenty hours a week to provide themselves with food and shelter and clothing. The rest of the time, they could play, or sleep, or do whatever they wanted. And they lived in a natural world, with clean air, clean water, beautiful trees and sunsets. Think about it. Twenty hours a week. Thirty thousand years ago.’<br/></i></blockquote><br/>The first claim is flatly false: average housework by US women <a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w13985.pdf"">decreased by about 14 hours(!) a week</a> over this period. (Table 6, last column.) This is despite ballooning house sizes, inventory of objects to maintain, and time actually spent with the children. It also omits our greatly increased levels of hygiene and personal fragrance, though I suppose that could be zero-sum if we habituate to it.<br/><br/>The second is false but not as flatly. I can't find anyone speculating ""twenty hours"" about the economy of the Upper Paleolithic French. If Crichton is merely mashing up the famous <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_affluent_society"">Bushman studies</a> with the punchy image of Lascaux, then despite celebrated dissemination by anthropologists, the claim is untrue: contemporary African hunter-gatherers spend <a href=""http://www.rachellaudan.com/2016/01/was-the-agricultural-revolution-a-terrible-mistake.html"">more than 50 hours a week on food production</a>.

He is the most effective educator who aims less at perfecting specific acquirements than at producing that mental condition which renders acquirements easy, and leads to their useful application...<br/><br/>On the same ground it may be said that the most effective writer is... he who rouses in others the activities that must issue in discovery, who awakes men from their indifference to the right and the wrong, who nerves their energies to seek for the truth and live up to it at whatever cost... he clears away the film from your eyes that you may search for data to some purpose. He does not, perhaps, convince you, but he strikes you, undeceives you, animates you. You are not directly fed by his books, but you are braced as by a walk up to an alpine summit, and yet subdued to calm and reverence as by the sublime things to be seen from that summit.  Such a writer is Thomas Carlyle. <br/><br/>It is an idle question to ask whether his books will be read a century hence: if they were all burnt as the grandest of Suttees on his funeral pile, it would be only like cutting down an oak after its acorns have sown a forest. For there is hardly a superior or active mind of this generation that has not been modified by Carlyle’s writings; there has hardly been an English book written for the last ten or twelve years that would not have been different if Carlyle had not lived... The extent of his influence may be best seen in the fact that ideas which were startling novelties when he first wrote them are now become common-places. And we think few men will be found to say that this influence on the whole has not been for good... </blockquote></blockquote></i><br/>(Who didn't start the fire...)<br/><br/>[<a href=""http://thecodelesscode.com/case/27"">Free here</a>]<br/>[<a href=""https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/"">Thinking #3, Theory #2</a>]<br/>",,,1,0

[The revival of the distinction is due to that lionized demon <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_and_the_Art_of_Writing"">Leo Strauss</a>.] Maths is an interesting border case, but its clarity and attempt to destroy ambiguity make it exoteric, I think.) <br/><br/>The exoteric intention strikes me as firstly just good manners and important for intellectual honesty (accountability, critical clarity).

Catherine Wilson forced me to think of Descartes as more than a strong mathematician, incomplete scientist, bigoted apriorist and shoddy Analytic. Not least, she wrote <a href=""http://www.philosophica.ugent.be/fulltexts/76-4.pdf"">this</a>, maybe the brassiest passage I've ever seen in an academic journal:<br/><blockquote><i>if Descartes had written a Preface to the </i>Meditations<i> that was truthful, faithful to his firmest convictions, and philosophically consistent, the relevant section would have gone something like this:<br/><blockquote><br/>I cannot demonstrate the immortality of the human soul, and probably no philosopher can. Immortality is not logically impossible, but it wouldn’t be what you are probably imagining it to be either. Perception, like sensation and emotion, is a registering by our minds of occurrences in our nerves and brain. If our minds endure after death, therefore, as far as the philosopher can tell, they will feel neither pain, nor pleasure, for they will no longerform a composite with our bodies. We will no longer see colours, touch objects, and hear sounds. We will not remember events ofour past lives. We will be numb and inert. Animals will be, as both Aristotle and Lucretius thought, nothing after death, and wehumans will be almost nothing - at most capable of imageless thought and intellectual memory. Of course, we can hope for more than this. Perhaps our bodies will be resurrected and reattached to our minds, so that we are restored to awareness of a world. But this is a matter of faith and cannot be philosophically demonstrated, whereas more important truths such as the excellence of our minds and bodies can be philosophically demonstrated. <br/><br/>Be that as it may, we are not mere animals. Our language and rationality indicate that we are specially favoured by God. As to whether animals are conscious, I do not know. I avoid speculative philosophy. But everyone can appreciate that animalscannot carry on a conversation, and I seriously doubt that animals reason, for I can show how their behaviour is mediated by the brain to which their sensory organs report, without ascribing reasoning to them. <br/><br/>The Fathers of the Church were wrong to scorn the human body asa source of moral corruption and to suggest that it is a shell that we will happily cast off. We use the cerebral representations it forms for purposes as exalted as mathematics, and if we could not understand and trust proofs about the triangle, how should we understand and feel confident about proofs about invisible objects such as God?...Admire God, who has given you a world to study, as well as to experience, and a mind equipped with language and reasoning powers, but leave off worrying about eternal rewards and punishments. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Of course Descartes could not have published such a Preface, not in France and not under his own name. Yet it was to communicate this very different message that he offered, without his heart being in the task, to prove the immortality of the soul.<br/><br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Charitable to say the least, but that's what we owe the very distant.",,,1,0

The piece on golf is characteristic - hilarious, fluid, razor-bladed. <br/><br/>The basic problem with him: his horror of golf would be better spent on actually horrific things (e.g. his own aestheticised violence). To be fair the second half’s travel pieces spend exactly that: from being right inamidst hallucinatory police brutality in Haiti, to the Africa pieces which buck stereotypes and complacency. He has vast sensitivity or sensibility, but he pairs it with a kind of generalisation (e.g. “<i>begging is a consequence of opportunity, not poverty</i>”) and off-piste counter-PC phrasemaking, as if to shock us out of respecting him.<br/><br/>He uses his friend Jeremy Clarkson brilliantly – as stooge, dim counterpoint to Gill’s own professed post-masculine, pro-gay, pro-grey, pro-oppressed enlightenment.

(Half the book is his confessing to childhood theft, psychosis, academic failure, and petty vendettas.)

They operate with the machinery of prejudice and distortion. Their purpose is not fact but propaganda. The scientific method is the tool that humans have developed to break the dominion of the narrative. It has been designed specifically to dissolve anecdote, to strip out emotion and leave only unpolluted data. It is a new kind of language, a modern sorcery, and it has gifted our species incredible powers. We can eradicate plagues, extend our lives by decades, build rockets and fly through space. But we can hardly be surprised if some feel an instinctive hostility towards it, for it is fundamentally inhuman.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>Storr is seriously out of his depth on the science: he is always at least second-hand from the evidence (when interviewing researchers), and often third-hand (most of his citations are pop science books), and so several chapters suffer from journalism's classic problem, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGArqoF0TpQ"">false balance</a>. The reason this isn't a call to shut the book is because he doesn't spare himself, states this repeatedly - and this is in fact <i>the theme</i> of his book: that almost all of us are unable to infer the truth about a shocking diversity of things.*<br/><br/>For instance, not just the past-life cranks, but also the Skeptics he encounters are out of their depth, and deserve the calling-out they get from him. No one can think they're past the need for doubt.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>I am surprised, for a start, that so few of these disciples of empirical evidence seem to be familiar with the scientific literature on the subject that impassions them so. I am suspicious, too, about the real source of their rage. If they are motivated, as they frequently insist, by altruistic concern over the dangers of supernatural belief, why don't they obsess over jihadist Muslims, homophobic Christians or racist Jewish settlers? Why this focus on stage psychics, ghosthunters and alt-med hippies?<br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>During our conversation, I asked Randi if he has ever, in his life, changed his position on anything due to an examination of the evidence. After a long silence, he said, 'That's a good question. I have had a few surprises along the way that got my attention rather sharply.' <br/>&nbsp; 'What were these?' I asked. <br/>He thought again, for some time. 'Oh, some magic trick that I decided on the modus operandi.'...<br/>'So you’ve never been wrong about anything significant?'<br/>'In regard to the Skeptical movement and my work...' There was another stretched and chewing pause. He conferred with his partner, to see if he had any ideas. 'No. Nothing occurs to me at the moment.'<br/></i></blockquote><br/>That's not how memory works though, is it? <br/><br/>Even given his unusual humility, Storr is too literal-minded and prosecutorial (""<i>I have been looking for evidence that James Randi is a liar</i>""). Storr is disillusioned with particular Skeptics, and reacts by throwing out scepticism:<br/><blockquote><i> For many Skeptics, evidence-based truth has been sacralised. It has caused them to become irrational in their judgements of the motives of those with whom they do not agree...<br/>This monoculture we would have, if the hard rationalists had their way, would be a deathly thing. So bring on the psychics, bring on the alien abductees, bring on the two John Lennons – bring on a hundred of them. Christians or no, there will be tribalism. Televangelists or no, there will be scoundrels. It is not religion or fake mystics that create these problems, it is being human. Where there is illegality or racial hatred, call the police. Where there is psychosis, call Professor Richard Bentall. Where there is misinformation, bring learning. But where there is just ordinary madness, we should celebrate. Eccentricity is our gift to one another. It is the riches of our species. To be mistaken is not a sin. Wrongness is a human right.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>And when Randi corrects himself in the course of a sentence (""<i>I didn't go to grade school at all, I went to the first few grades of grade school</i>""), Storr leaps on this as a serious contradiction rather than just the patchy nature of speech. Sure, he talks about his emotional bias against scepticism - but he still leaves in this idiot journo behaviour, the uncharitable coaxing out of flaws.<br/><br/>These chapters were a good ethnography of '<a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Traditional_rationality"">traditional</a>' <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WeQv9LSCj9nYXoTwJ/what-is-wrong-with-traditional-rationality"">(nontechnical) rationality</a>. But Storr doesn't know about the other kind (which both foregrounds and copes with all the cognitive biases he is so struck and scarred by), and so his conclusion about rationalism is completely awry.**<br/><br/>The title is fitting in a few ways: Storr sees these people as persecuted underdogs (he likes many of the quacks and fringeists, and so focusses on the arrogance and bias of the - however correct - mainstream figures dealing with them); and they certainly have the holy madness of people who cry out despite knowing they will be ostracised. <br/><blockquote><i>Over the last few months, John E Mack has become a kind of hero to me. Despite his earlier caution, he ended up believing in amazing things: intergalactic space travel and terrifying encounters in alien craft that travelled seamlessly through nonphysical dimensions. And when his bosses tried to silence him, he hired a lawyer. He fought back against the dean and his dreary minions. He battled hard in the name of craziness...<br/></i></blockquote><br/>David Irving is interesting in this regard: he does not act like a fraud (e.g. he sues people for libel, even though this brings intensive scrutiny of his research), but rather a sort of compulsive masochist-contrarian. Stranger still, his (beloved) family were all solid anti-Nazi soldiers in WWII. (Storr contorts himself to explain Irving's identification with Hitler as due to their sharing an admiration of the British forces (...)) <br/><br/>Storr's awful experience on a Vipassana retreat is a vivid example of the Buddhist <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/the-dark-knight-of-the-souls/372766/"">dark night of the soul</a>. We don't know what fraction of people suffer terribly from meditation, but despite its <a href=""https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/23/1064082990875.html"">cuddly image</a>, there's surely large overlap with the <a href=""http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254610/WHO-MSD-MER-2017.2-eng.pdf;jsessionid=C7A88D6AF4B91BEB0EBF7EA1A65E2671?sequence=1"">8% of people</a> who are clinically depressive and/or anxious.<br/><br/>The chapter on psi does not represent <a href=""http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/2011/WagenmakersEtAl2011_JPSP.pdf"">the state</a> <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033423"">of evidence</a> <a href=""http://andrewgelman.com/2011/01/06/that_silly_esp/"">properly</a> - perhaps because one of his proof-readers was <a href=""https://slate.com/health-and-science/2017/06/daryl-bem-proved-esp-is-real-showed-science-is-broken.html"">Professor Daryl Bloody Bem</a>. ***<br/><br/>The ending is stirring but tilts over into relativism:<br/><blockquote><i>The Skeptic tells the story of Randi the hero; the psychic of Randi the devil. We all make these unconscious plot decisions...<br/><br/>We are all creatures of illusion. We are made out of stories. From the heretics to the Skeptics, we are all lost in our own secret worlds. <br/></i></blockquote><br/>But the question is to what <i>degree</i>! And the degree of lostness, of inverse rationality, varies by many orders of whatever magnitude you wish to pick.<br/><br/>Storr's disquiet at the sheer power of cognitive bias, and the systematic failures of yes/no science (that is: statistical significance rather than effect size estimation) is well and good.  (<a href=""http://andrewgelman.com/2017/06/29/lets-stop-talking-published-research-findings-true-false/"">Gelman</a>: <br/><blockquote><i>I think ‘the probability that a model or a hypothesis is true’ is generally a meaningless statement except as noted in certain narrow albeit important examples.</i></blockquote>.) <br/>And his humane approach is certainly bound to be more compelling to mystics and flakes than e.g. deGrasse Tyson's smug dismissals. But Storr is scared of grey, of the fact that doubt is only reducible and not eliminable. This is because he doesn't know anything about our most beautiful weapons: probabilism, Bayesian inference, Analysis. <br/><br/>I recommend <i><a href=""http://elephantinthebrain.com/"">Elephant in the Brain</a></i> or <i><a href=""https://www.readthesequences.com/"">Rationality from A to Z</a></i> instead as an approach to the vital, dreadful side of cognition (including advice on avoiding being a fake, partial, traditional sceptic); they have less angst and false equivalences, and were written by people who understand the balance of evidence. <br/><br/>Actually that's too strong; I am frustrated with Storr because he is so similar to me, except he doesn't grasp that the technical is the path out of (many) biases. There's a lot wrong with it and you should probably read it, and how often can one say that?<br/><br/><br><br/>* Storr is right that skeptics can lack compassion. The ""Morgellons"" people <i>are</i> victims regardless of what their <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"">etiology</a> turns out to be (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusional_parasitosis"">mental illness</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formication"">nerve disorders</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithonyssus_bacoti"">tropical rat mites</a>, or yes malicious sentient fibres). At minimum, they are victims of bad fortune plus rigid and actually unscientific medical practices. The Lesswrong style of rationalist has less of this problem IMO (more emotional literacy; a more Californian culture).<br/><br/>** Storr:<br/><blockquote><i>    I am concerned that I have overstated my argument. In my haste to write my own coherent story, I have barely acknowledged the obvious truth that minds do sometimes change. People find faith and they lose it. Mystics become Skeptics. Politicians cross the floor. I wonder why this happens. Is it when the reality of what is actually happening in our lives overpowers the myth that we make of themselves? Are we simply pursuing ever more glorious hero missions?...<br/><br/>This is an imperfect system, as it relies on many secondary sources. Moreover, I do not declare myself to be free of the biases that afflict any writer, and I'm certainly not immune to making mistakes. If any errors are noted, or if new findings supersede claims made in the text, I would be very grateful to receive notification via willstorr.com, so future editions can be corrected.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/><br/>*** Important caveat to the headline of that linked article from Gelman:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>The only thing I don’t like about Engber’s article is its title, “Daryl Bem Proved ESP Is Real. Which means science is broken.” I understand that “Daryl Bem Proved ESP Is Real” is kind of a joke, but to me this is a bit too close to the original reporting on Bem, back in 2011, where people kept saying that Bem’s study was high quality, state-of-the-art psychology, etc. Actually, Bem’s study was crap. It’s every much as bad as the famously bad papers on beauty and sex ratio, ovulation on voting, elderly-related words and slow walking, etc.<br/><br/>And “science” is not broken. Crappy science is broken. Good science is fine. If “science” is defined as bad articles published in PPNAS—himmicanes, air rage, ages ending in 9, etc.—then, sure, science is broken. But if science is defined as the real stuff, then, no, it’s not broken at all. <br/></i></blockquote>",,,1,0

The detectives are intelligent and hilarious, but have to navigate two extreme and depressing environments: the streets and City Hall, violence and politics.<br/><br/>Simon was embedded with them, and completely effaces himself, makes this novelistic. We get a glorious outsider view, see things the detectives don't: <br/><blockquote><i>[The detective] glides past the lockup without looking inside, and so doesn't see the final, unmistakable expression on Robert Frazier's face. Pure murderous hate.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>He gives a complete chapter to most of the detectives, tracking them through a couple of sordid weeks. They are all distinctive, sharp in different ways, but this approach means it stretches on.<br/><br/>Also a study of the incredibly poor incentives the bureaucracy gives the detectives: they're rewarded for arrests, not convictions, and individually penalised for open homicides. I don't want to think about what this did to their false arrest rate. <br/><blockquote><i>A case in which the pathologist's finding is being pended is not, to the police department, a murder. And if it isn't a murder, it doesn't go up on the board. And if it isn't up on the board, it doesn't really exist.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>No weight was given to the difficulty of the case - whether witnesses remained at the scene, whether physical evidence existed, whether the weapon was found. All this killed inter-squad cooperation, and led to infighting over dumb luck of the draw. <br/><blockquote><i>In human terms, the scene at 3002 McElderry Street was a massacre; in the statistical terms of urban homicide work, it was the stuff from which a detective fashions dreams.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>(No other crime counted in the stats, despite Homicide also covering accidental deaths and suicides. This was an incentive to frame things as e.g. suicide if at all possible.) <br/><blockquote><i>the chance of actually being convicted of a crime after being identified by authorities is about 60 percent. And if you factor in those unsolved homicides, the chance of being cuaght and convicted for taking a life in Baltimore is just over 40 percent [in 1988].<br/></blockquote></i><br/>You might conclude - falsely - that internal stats are worse than nothing - but only stats as bad as these are. A classic of informal institutional economics. <br/><br/>The nationwide murder 'clearance rate' (arrest rate) was 70%. Amazing that it was this high, in that comparatively low-surveillance, low-social-trust place.<br/><blockquote><i>     The [squad's] clearance rate - murders closed by arrest - is now 36 percent and falling, a... threat to [Lieutenant] Gary D’Addario’s tenure. The board that gave His Eminence reason for concern six weeks ago has continued to fill with open murders, and it is on D’Addario’s side of the wall that the names are writ in red. Of the twenty-five homicides handled by Dee’s three squads, only five are down; whereas Stanton’s shift has cleared ten of sixteen...<br/><br/>There is no point in explaining that three fifths of D’Addario’s homicides happen to be drug-related, just as seven of those solved by Stanton’s shift are domestics or other arguments... It is the unrepentant worship of statistics that forms the true orthodoxy of any modern police department.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>More incentive analysis, on police shootings and the shameful closing of ranks:<br/><blockquote><i>In the United States, only a cop has the right to kill as an act of personal deliberation and action.  To that end, Scotty McCown and three thousand other men and women were sent out on the streets of Baltimore with .38-caliber Smith&Wessons, for which they received several weeks of academy firearms training augmented by one trip to the police firing range every year. Coupled with an individual officer’s judgement, that is deemed expertise enough to make the right decision every time.<br/><br/>It is a lie. It is a lie the police department tolerates because to do otherwise would shatter the myth of infallibility on which rests its authority for lethal force. And it is a lie that the public demands, because to do otherwise would expose a terrifying ambiguity. The false certainty, the myth of perfection, on which our culture feeds…<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>    There's so much careful and sympathetic detail about the job (and no deep portrait of any suspects), that Simon risks partisanship - writing ""copaganda"", as internet radicals call it. Anyone who's seen <i>The Wire</i> knows this isn't a problem. (He has solidarity with the rank and file, and contempt for the suits.) <br/><blockquote><i>for the black, inner-city neighborhoods of Baltimore, the city's finest were for generations merely another plague to endure: poverty, ignorance, despair, police.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Speaking of which: This is not at all made redundant by <i>The Wire</i> - the show has an entire pathos-pathetic angle (the anti-authority cop) missing here, and this is more focussed on the law side.<br/><br/>Their humour is fantastically sick. <br/><blockquote><i>the application of criteria such as comfort and amusement to the autopsy room is ample proof of a homicide man's peculiar and sustaining psychology. But for the detectives, the most appalling visions have always demanded the greatest detachment...<br/></blockquote></i><br/><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17521127&fbclid=IwAR1uFwE3NzWZMLp4v6VyJSuaXt9A5znB27peiHbndeg0k4ojVVVdHqUvEBg"">Someone on Hacker News</a> was up on their high horse about the black humour of medics recently. This strikes me as perfectly backwards. I would <i>much</i> prefer a doctor (or a detective) with a nasty sense of humour: it suggests emotional detachment, so they're more likely to think clearly; and it certainly has a cathartic and bonding role, improving their health and teamwork. This idiotically literal, first-order model of psychology (as if people were so easy to program!) is everywhere, for instance all discourse about fake news, porn, and violent computer games. <br/><br/>The section about the idiocy and arbitrariness of juries is sickening and I recommend that you don't read it if you want to continue thinking well of your society.<br/><blockquote><i>The operant logic of a Baltimore city jury is as fantastical a process as any other of our universe’s mysteries. This one is innocent because he seemed so polite and well spoken on the stand, that one because there were no fingerprints on the weapon to corroborate the testimony of four witnesses. And this one over here is telling the truth when he says he was beaten into a confession; we know that, of course, because why else would anyone willingly confess to a crime if he wasn’t beaten?</blockquote></i><br/><br/><blockquote><i>The other eight jurors offered little opinion except to say they would vote for whatever was agreed upon... It was the Memorial Day weekend. They wanted to go home...<br/>""What brought you all around to first-degree?"" he asks.<br/>""I wasn't going to budge and that other woman, the one in the back row, she wasn't going to change her mind either. She was for first-degree from the very beginning, too. After a while, everyone wanted to go home, I guess.""<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>The book has aged badly in one way: Simon completely falls for two entrenched bits of pseudoscience, the <a href=""https://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_lie_detector_test_revisited_a_great_example_of_junk_science"">polygraph</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph#Effectiveness"">and</a> <a href=""https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/12/18044688/criminal-profilers-mindhunter-hannibal-criminal-minds<br/>"">profiling</a>. But many people still believe in these things, and anyway it's a rare lapse of scepticism, for him.<br/><br/>I think this is the first 'true crime' book I've read. Don't know if this is the pinnacle of the genre, then, or if the genre's better than literary people think.",,,1,0

I think this author insertion is why people call it 'postmodern', though of course <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-insertion"">it's an ancient trick</a> and Amis doesn't share their mean ideology. There's also self-reference:<br/><blockquote><i>What </i>was<i> Richard?

Richard has violent thoughts and a violent worldview but is not violent, he fails to be violent; and Amis contains that container.<br/><br/>There are unannounced focal shifts every couple pages, three of which focalisations sound very similar to each other (whether psycho Steve, revenger Richard, misanthrope Martin).<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    This, surely, is how we account for the darkness and the helpless melancholy of twentieth-century literature. These writers, these dreamers and seekers, stood huddled like shivering foundlings on the cliffs of a strange new world: one with no servants in it. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>It's not just about books; the underworld of 90s Britain also gets it:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    the criminal resembles the artist in his pretensions, his incompetence, and his self-pity.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>You have to go a very long way - through tell of murdered children, celebrated suicides, denied misogyny, embraced misandry, deep duplicity - to get the merest possibility of redemption and getting over yourself. (And even that subverted: <i>The season of comedy... Decorum will be observed</i>.) The middle drags terribly. It's worth it.  <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>* The titular Information is hard truths, avoided thoughts, intimations of inadequacy and mortality.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>The information is advertising a symposium of pain. Pains of all faiths and all denominations... It is ordinary and everyday. On the beach the waves do it ceaselessly, gathering mass and body, climbing until they break and are then resummoned into generality with a sound like breath sucked in between the teeth.<br/><br/>Weakness will get you where you are weakest. Weakness will be strong and bold, and make for your weak spot. If in the head, then in the head. If in the heart, then in the heart. If in the loins, then in the loins... The information is nothing. Nothing: the answer is so many of our questions. What will happen to me when I die? What is death anyway? Is there anything I can do about that? Of what does the universe primarily consist? What is the measure of our influence within it? What is our span, in cosmic time?<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>* Richard's friend is called Gwyn (Welsh for blessed).<br/>*  His book 'Untitled' is so serious that it causes its readers physical harm, like a petty version of the samizdat in <i>Infinite Jest</i>.<br/>* Amis is more like Gwyn than Richard in career terms (got an unprecedented £500k advance for this) but is obviously temperamentally more like Richard.<br/>* The more literary a work, the less it says plainly: the fewer hints you get. That is, *puzzles* are part of the essence of literariness. The bad reading of this is that it's all about showing off: how clever and sphinxish the author is, how clever and oedipal the reader, how able to delay gratification (or go without it) each is. Amis' books are quite puzzley, Richard's very much so, Gwyn's not a jot.<br/>* This line works as a diss on New Labour:<br/><blockquote><i>It often seemed to him, moving in the circles he moved in and reading what he read, that everyone in England was Labour except the government.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>even though the book was written in 1994, before New Labour. A joke which survives inversion!<br/>* <a href=""https://www.astrotheme.com/astrology/Martin_Amis"">Presented without comment</a>.",,,1,0

Bad spelling (cognitive dysfunction) is rare in sci-fi - let alone in SF titles - because the authors are trying to be taken seriously to make up for the genre fiction status? - and I've gotten over it since.

It was then that the species finally gave up the struggle to remain in macrohuman form, pulling back fully into a virtual environment and resorted to storing its ancient biochemical inheritance as information only, in the hope that one day such fragile concoctions of water and minerals could exist again upon the face of the Earth.<br/><br/>Its time from then was long as people reckoned it from that point, short as they would have before.  The sun's photosphere continued to expand until it swallowed Venus, and Earth did not survive much longer; the last humans on Earth perished together in a crumbling machine core as its cooling circuits failed, the half-finished life-boat spaceship they had been attempting to construct already melted to a hollow husk beside them.<br/><br/>He suffered with each child abandoned to the snow; with every old man or woman left - too exhausted to shiver any more - under piles of ice-hard rags; with all the people swept away by the howling, fire-storm winds; with each consciousness extinguished - its ordered information reduced to random meaninglessness - by the increasing heat.<br/><br/>And he woke from such dreams sometimes wondering whether all that he was being shown could possibly be true, and on other occasions so convinced that it had been real that he would have faithfully believed what he had seen was the inescapable future, rather than some mere possibility, projection or warning.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Problems: <br/>* Climaxes about 2/3 through. I suppose that's okay, it's not a three-act play.<br/>* Bascule is hooked into the king's brain surveillance network, but regularly escapes the king's secret police.<br/>* Banks shows the crypt people having <a href=""http://ageofem.com/"">Em</a> accelerated cognition (about 1000x), but without Ems dominating the economy and society. (Actually, no human besides the military, scientists and secret police are heard of doing any real work, so maybe this is the case in the background.) <br/>* It's set on Earth, which is odd for Banks, but this fact isn't used much. Some of us stayed behind.<br/>* There are several virtual worlds in this (the bird crypt, the transport map, the interrogation allegories, the deep crypt with its garden) but they're insufficiently different from each other and base reality (all have a kind of fairytale logic, all have mythical beasts stalking around).<br/>* None of the sheer stakes, grandeur, and philosophical tension of the Culture books.<br/>* Fun but a mere sketch.",,,1,0

Rivals <i>Earthsea</i> as the wisest and subtlest Fantasy, for people who don't like Fantasy. Fast-moving, full of ironies, antimonies, and ambivalent symbolism - the kind which doesn't hit you over the head (I'm thinking of Gandalf changing colour hmmmmmm). <br/><br/>There's a dozen memorable characters in 300pp (<a href=""https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Gurlo%25C3%25ABs&prev=search"">Gurloes</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thecla"">Thecla</a>, Agilus, Agia, Talos, Ultan, <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inire"">Inire</a>, Eata, Baldanders, the man himself), even though many appear for just one scene. And there's a very unobtrusive frame narrative which deepens and undermines things. <br/><br/>And under all that: the beautiful post-post-apocalyptic layer: <i>New Sun</i> is actually science fiction, about what happens when the great project, Progress, collapses; what happens after thousands of years of decay. <br/><i><blockquote> those who dig for their livelihood say there is no land anywhere in which they can trench without turning up shards of the past. No matter where the spade turns the soil, it uncovers broken pavements and corroded metal; and scholars write that the kind of sand that artists call polychrome (because flecks of every colour are mixed with its whiteness) is actually not sand at all, but the glass of the past, now pounded by aeons of tumbling in the clamorous sea.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>It is <a href=""https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw"">Clarkean</a>: The book is unconcerned whether strange events are due to obscure high technology, psychological trickery, or bonafide supernatural force.<br/><br/>Because Wolfe is a bit difficult, it's not too incongruous to bring up <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanarrative"">Grand Narrative</a> now: sure, the French theorists were wrong to suggest that such ideas are dead in our time (or bad, if alive) but they certainly could die, and Wolfe explores what that'd be like. Nessus has no master idea - not even god, not even family, not even order. (Or maybe it's class again.)<br/><blockquote><i>""Severian. Name for me the seven principles of governance.""<br/>     A foreboding grew on me; I sensed that if I did not reply, some tragedy would occur. At last I began weakly, ""Anarchy . . .""<br/>     ""That is not governance, but the lack of it. I taught you that it precedes all governance. Now list the seven sorts.""<br/>     ""Attachment to the person of the monarch. Attachment to the bloodline or other sequence of succession. Attachment to the royal state. Attachment to a code legitimizing the governing state. Attachment to the law only. Attachment to a greater or lesser board of electors, as framers of the law. Attachment to an abstraction conceived as including the body of electors, other bodies giving rise to them and numerous other elements, largely ideal.""<br/>     ""Tolerable. Of these, which is the earlier form, and which the highest?""<br/>     ""The development is in the order given, Master,"" I said. ""But I do not rrecall that you ever asked us before which was highest.""<br/>     Master Malrubius leaned forward, his eyes burning brighter than the coals of the fire. ""Which is the highest, Severian?""<br/>     ""The last, Master?""<br/>     ""You mean attachment to an abstraction conceived as including the body of electors, other bodies giving rise to them, and numerous other elements, largely ideal?""<br/>     ""Yes, Master.""<br/>     ""Of what kind, Severian, is your own attachment to the Divine Entity?""<br/>     I said nothing. It may have been that I was thinking; but if so, my mind was too much filled with sleep to be conscious of its thought. Instead, I became profoundly aware of my physical surroundings. The sky above my face in all its grandeur seemed to have been made solely for my benefit, and to be presented for my inspection now. I lay upon the ground as upon a woman, and the very air that surrounded me seemed a thing as admirable as crystal and as fluid as wine.<br/>     ""Answer me, Severian.""<br/>     ""The first, if I have any.""<br/>     ""To the person of the monarch?""<br/>     ""Yes, because there is no succession."" <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>(<i>Dune</i> occupies the same SFF feudalist netherland as this, but is much clumsier, occasionally contemptible.) <br/><br/>    How do you write a truly immoral sympathetic character? (In this case, the most immoral: who does the worst thing you can do.) I think the answer is simple: <i>detail</i>. Make it first-person and simply show the ordinary range of interests, foibles, enculturation, passions. The reader does the rest.  (Compare <i>Lolita</i>, <i>Private Memoirs of a Justified Sinner</i>, <i>Wasp Factory</i>, <i>Crime and Punishment</i>...)<br/><blockquote><i>Gurloes was one of the most complex men I have known, because he was a complex man trying to be simple. Not a simple, but a complex man's idea of simplicity. Just as a courtier forms himself into something brilliant and involved, midway between a dancing master and a diplomacist, with a touch of assassin if needed, so Master Gurloes had shaped himself to be the dull creature a pursuivant or bailiff expected to see when he summoned the head of our guild, and that is the only thing a real torturer cannot be. The strain showed; though every part of Gurloes was as it should have been, none of the parts fit... He ate too much and too seldom, read when he thought no one knew of it, and visited certain of our clients, including one on the third level, to talk of things none of us eaves-dropping in the corridor outside could understand. His eyes were refulgent, brighter than any woman's. <br/></blockquote></i><br/>Severian is completely cold-blooded about violence while still being notably heroic and sentimental. <spoiler>(Ok he doesn't actually torture anyone.)</spoiler><br/><blockquote><i>By the use of the language of sorrow I had for the time being obliterated my sorrow - so powerful is the charm of words, which for us reduces to manageable entities all the passions that would otherwise madden and destroy...<br/></blockquote></i><br/>The heroism is natural and plausible, because he dooms himself in the middle of the book, so everything that happens is a bonus to him, so he takes bandits and duels and unlikely undertakings in his stride, which is an enviable attitude.<br/><br/>One of many lovely details: all the Latin is subtly wrong: '<i>terminus est</i>' taken to be 'this is the line of division' rather than 'this is the end'; '<i>felicibus brevis, miseris hora longa</i>', 'Men wait long for happiness'. But most of the rest of the jargon is historically accurate: 'hydrargyrum' for mercury, 'hipparch' for <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cavalier#Etymology"">cavalier</a>, 'archon' for lord, 'carnifex' for butcher, 'matross' for junior soldier, etc.<br/><br/>    The second half, the quest with Agia and Dorcas, reminds me of '<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Sunrise"">Before Sunrise</a>', of all things: glittering words exchanged by the young and instantly intimate. The writing is so fine and uncliched that it pulls off unreconstructed romance in the midst of post-apocalyptic feudalism. In general, the feudal trappings justify Wolfe's ornate prose well. Severian often says things that are wise to us, and the things which aren't make sense in brutal context:<br/><blockquote><i>the pattern of our guild is repeated mindlessly (like the repetitions of Father Inire's mirrors in the House Absolute) in the societies of every trade, so that they are all of them torturers, just as we. His quarry stands to the hunter as our clients to us; those who buy to the tradesman; the enemies of the Commonwealth to the soldier; the governed to the governors; men to women. All love that which they destroy.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>Nietzsche on the wheel:<br/><blockquote><i>Weak people believe what is forced on them. Strong people what they wish to believe, forcing that to be real. What is the Autarch but a man who believes himself Autarch and makes others believe by the strength of it.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Probably 5/5 on re-read.<br/><br/><br><br/>PS: I can't decide if this or <a href=""https://www.lwcurrey.com/pictures/158538.jpg?v=1519766806"">Fall of Hyperion</a> has the lower quality-of-book : awfulness-of-cover ratio.",,,1,0

But Morgan is always worthwhile: his books suspend the ideological alongside the unhappily sexual alongside big strange guns (e.g. an AIDS pistol, loaded with GM virus ‘Falwell’). More mature in some ways – there’s a feminist imam, and a religious character he doesn’t have violent contempt for – but also a bit busy and contralto. <br/><br/>Stross and Morgan refer to ‘black labs’ a lot – that is, dastardly underground geneticists. Every single time they did, I wondered what the authors had against Labradors. Sort it out.<br/>",,,1,0

So, one of the first <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction#Timeline"">real person slashfics</a> in history.

Then blackmail them, and steal their semen to sell off. Drugging Freud, Monet and Proust with a psychotic aphrodisiac, the three conspirators collect a Nobel sperm bank. Most of the men are disposed of in one pithy paragraph, with only comic details supplied. <br/><br/>It's scandalous because of its levity. The plot has more in common with <em>A Serbian Film </em>than <em>Carry On</em>, yet it keeps up the latter's matey banter. At one point Yasmin comes across Picasso, who promptly rapes and dismisses her, without need of the ""Sudanese blister beetle"" drug. Needless to say, this is tremendous sport:<br/><blockquote><i>""Do you know what he did afterwards?"" Yasmin said. ""He just buttoned up his trousers and said, ‘Thank you, mademoiselle. That was very refreshing. Now I must get back to my work.’ And he turned away, Oswald! He just turned away and started painting again!""<br/>""He’s Spanish,"" I said, ""like Alfonso."" I stepped out of the car and cranked the starting handle and when I got back in again, Yasmin was tidying her hair in the car mirror. <br/>""I hate to say it,” she said, ""but I rather enjoyed that one.""<br/>""Tell me,"" I said, ""is Monsieur Picasso a genius?""<br/>""Yes,"" she said, ""it was very strong. He shall be wildly famous one day.""<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>The sexual prowess of the drugged men is a means for Oswald to reflect on their overall quality. (The volume they produce is shorthand for his esteem of them, e.g.: ""<i>Fifty straws from Kipling.</i>"") It leaves Dahl room to propound a general ranking of the giant personalities of the eC20th. For instance, Einstein and Freud are able to resist their inverted rape for some minutes, earning both respect and suspicion. And of Freud:<br/><blockquote><i>""You should have seen his face, Oswald. You really should have seen it. The Beetle was hitting him and the sexcrazy glint was coming into h</span></span><span style=""color: #783f04; font-family: inherit;"">is eyes and he was beginning to flap his arms like an old crow. But I’ll say this for him. He didn’t jump me right away. He held off for at least a minute or so while he tried to analyze what the hell was happening. He looked down at his trousers. Then he looked up at me... He was really very decent about it all. As soon as he’d had his first explosion... he jumped away and ran back to his desk stark naked and began writing notes. He must be terrifically strong-minded. Great intellectual curiosity.""<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>The low point comes in the treatment of Shaw, by this stage a celibate disabled old man.

He was wearing a short black cloak with a hood covering his head. I couldn't open my eyes and look straight at him, because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Then I recognized him with certainty, in the light... he stepped back from my cot, and – just imagine this! – knelt down on the floor that was covered with rat droppings – I watched him through my eyelashes – and began to pray – two feet away from my ear! I could hear every word he whispered: <br/><br/>'... I beseech Thee, Lord, make him see reason and make him apologize to his Sovereign for his unimaginable words — so that I might forgive him and become free of the burden it is to me to keep him im­prisoned...’ He closed his eyes and said, as if to himself: ‘But if Thou hast decided otherwise, I say like Thy son said to Thee at Gethsemane: Father, I pray to Thee — but let Thy will be done, not mine. ’ And then, Jakob — then he lowered his head and opened his eyes, and looked straight into mine...<br/>“Well. Two words was all we exchanged. He whispered:<br/>'...Timothee?!'<br/>And I said, '</i>Tartuffe!<i>'<br/><br/>“He covered his ears with his palms and ran out of the casemate, in rather an unimperial fashion. And I haven’t seen him since.” Timo cleared his throat and added, sounding somewhat self-deprecating: “At least not awake, that is...”<br/>I said, “Timo, this story — surely it was only a dream?”<br/>Timo had walked over to the far corner of the room where the<br/>shadows cast by the sconce mirrors combined to create near­<br/>darkness. He stood there, almost invisible; even the glow of the<br/>pipe he was holding had gone out. Then he laughed and said: <br/>“Well — whatever you think best... ”<br/></blockquote></i><br/>But Kross is clumsy in inserting an enchanting peasant as Timo's wife; everyone who knows her is a complete Eeva fanboy, rhapsodising. But it's not clear why; she's brave and catty but otherwise pretty indistinct. There's definitely an undercurrent of promoting Estonian accomplishments here - not many of Timo and Eeva's grand and broad virtues are attested in the evidence, which makes them <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue"">Mary</a> and <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu"">Marty</a> Sue in Kross' fanfiction - but it strikes me that this is not just chauvinism, given Kross' context.

By 2086, military aid has been fully privatised, making a free market of unilateral political force:<br/><blockquote><i>All over the world, men and women still find causes worth killing and dying for. And who are we to argue with them? Have we lived in their circumstances? Have we felt what they feel? No. It is not our place to say if they are right or wrong. At Shorn Conflict Investments, we are concerned with only two things. Will they win? And will it pay?</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Morgan's ultra-capitalism is internally coherent, but weighed down by Chomskyan exaggeration and a clumsy <i>Mad Max</i> road-rage system in which people drive FAST and MEAN to get corporate promotion. (Awwwww shit: metaphor!!) Like many a bright-eyed anti-globaliser, Morgan overdoes it; at one point, a senior partner at Shorn erupts into a caricature inhuman plutocrat. I've added numbering to the exec's rant because it is such a dense cluster of Chomskyan muddled good intentions:<br/><blockquote><i>Do you really think we can </i>0)<i> afford to have the developing world develop? You think we could have survived the rise of a modern, articulated Chinese superpower twenty years ago? You think we could manage an Africa full of countries run by intelligent, a) uncorrupt democrats? Or a Latin America run by men like Barranco? Just imagine it for a moment.

Also, everyone has an economic interest in the economic development of the world; roughly, the richer my neighbours are, the more they can buy from me, the richer am I. <br><br/>a) Corruption is terrible for business; it subsumes about <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/cleangovbiz/49693613.pdf"">one dollar in twenty</a> <i>of the entire world's output</i>. Individually beneficial acts of bribery collectively lead to a ludicrously bad (and anti-capital!) state; <br/><br>1) Education is good for economies, and thus good for the West (by point 0); <br/><br>2) healthy workers are <i>very</i> good for economies; <br/><br>3) suffering war disrupts consumer spending more than anything else (as opposed to the economics of inflicting war, admittedly, but that isn't the plutocrat's point); <br/><br>4) (a certain limited form of) aspiration is the very heart of a consumer economy; <br/><br>5) there were huge economic gains from feminism; <br/><br>6) <a href=""http://www.ictsd.org/downloads/2012/08/net-food-importing-developing-countries-who-they-are-and-policy-options-for-global-price-volatility.pdf"">this is mildly true</a>, but governmental horrors like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy#Anti-development"">CAP</a> give Morgan's rage some urgency;  <br/><br>7) By 2086? Robots; 8) By 2086? Robots; <br/><br>9) This one is true and horrible.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>This economic naivete is balanced by his characteristic virtues: pace, cool uncliched weapons, pro-social rage (here, wifebeaters and Nazis suffer atrocities). In a rarity for SF, Morgan <i>under</i>estimates the rate of tech growth (by 2086): for instance, their drones are much larger and more limited in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqHrTtvFFIs"">application</a> than ours are already. (The book is also a good portrait of ordinary marital pain.)<br/><br/><blockquote><i>One of his warders offered to let him have some books, but when the promised haul arrived, it consisted of a bare half-dozen battered paperbacks by authors Chris had never heard of. He picked one at random, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon"">luridly violent far-future crime novel</a> about a detective who could exchange bodies at will, but the subject matter was alien to him and his attention drifted: it all seemed very far-fetched.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>A few nice meanings in there: Morgan's apparent self-deprecation is actually bragging about his still being in print in a hundred years; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi_Kovacs"">Kovacs</a> is just this book's Faulkner character plus genetic mods; thus Faulkner finding the book ""alien"" is a serious comment on his lack of self-awareness, and explains why the loss of Carla is so fatal to his character (he can't introspect enough to prevent his fall). <br/><br/>Crass and flashy, but psychologically ambitious.

Many beautiful passages, much reflection on the course of recent British history - but never didactic -<br/><blockquote><i>Ben and Ben's fellow squash prodigy, keen, bulgy-muscled Nolan Oates lolled side by side on a striped recliner and a Portofino chair chosen by Naomi and bought by Henry out of the fruits of his labours burying and burning the dead for the children of the dead.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/><blockquote><i>They cycled through the night, not knowing where they were going, ignoring maps, signposts, stars, anxious only to be far from that flat scrubland. Fear fuelled their tendons, pushed the pedals hard. They were oblivious to the sycamore’s grazes and to the stiff hills. Their tyres purred. They passed hamlets, silos, byres, kennels, the illumined windows of hostile hearths. The swarthy bulk of a moor’s escarpment slumped against the sky, a beast best left to lie. The world was every shade of black: slave, sump, crow, char. Clumsy clouds lumbered into each other, blind, bloated, slomo, piling up in a piggyback of obese buggers over the terrible trees. The night was loud with the shrieks and moans of creatures berating their fate and their want of shelter. When the rain came it was from a sluice that stretched from one horizon to the next. The road became a tide against them.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>and anyway it's extremely well-grounded in Meades' obsessive attention to detail (not just artistic detail, any detail)<br/><blockquote><i>The miracle of life. That baby could now bring a carbon-fibre racket into contact with a rubber ball travelling at 90 m.p.h. in such a way that the ball’s speed would be so reduced that when it touched the front wall of the court it would plummet vertically to the floor. That was a miracle. And so was the human ingenuity which made the connection between that ball’s terminal trajectory and a dead bird and advertised that ingenuity by the use of the figurative construction ‘to kill a ball’. Telephones, butterfly stroke, nylon-tip pens, the emotive capability of music, the way some people are blond and some are left-handed, the shapes of faces in clouds, water’s inability to flow uphill, the tastiness of animals’ flesh, pain, bustles, reptiles’ poison sacs, sinus drainage, cantilevering, DNA testing – miracles of life, all of them.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Meades is an aesthete - but still rightly unforgiving of art in the wrong place, here an experimental postmodernist roundabout that kills five.<br/><br/>It get better when it stops sneering. The middle section portrays two professions, two quiet lives: funeral director and civil engineer, warm family man and late bloomer:<br/><blockquote><i>Exclusion, Henry recognised, was what defined every profession. He practised it himself. It was what differentiated him from civilians. Without exclusion and the stamp of expertise it brought … well, the unthinkable might occur: the bereaved might realise that they could do it themselves, take the law into their own hands. They’d conduct backyard cremations. They’d dig graves in their gardens as though burying the family pet.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>The middle seems natalist; the nuclear family seem much happier. Just wait. The death of your parents as only their being ""<i>denied a future of rages, chair-lifts, incontinence, slobbering aphasia, fright, wind, butter on the rug, soup on the cardie...  How long he would have had to prepare himself for the embalming job of a lifetime, how long he would have had to watch as all dignity left her and she became a machine for processing soup into diarrhoea. It might be painful watching them turn into veg, decline into insentient senescence before our eyes but at least it’s a process that acquaints us with loss gradually.</i>"".<br/><br/>(Meades contrives a neat point about human nature: when the Crystal Palace burns down, the fire engines couldn't reach it to save it because the roads are congested with spectators. This isn't accurate but whatev.)<br/><br/>Oscillates between sympathy and unforgiving light; suddenly swerves away from two offered happy endings. Not sure what to make of the grim climax - the cuckold going off the deep end, becoming unmoored from his home, his work, his decency. Meades is no patriarch, so the implication shouldn't be 'so would you'. I think it's about the madness of biology, its inhumane imperatives and tragic spread.<br/><br/>Good but not a patch <a href=""https://meadesshrine.blogspot.com/p/shrine.html"">on his films</a>.",,,1,0

If he killed  a snail he had to stamp on it quickly and then run away, because it went all squishy like blowing your nose. Then he would go back and have a look at the broken brown shell stuck in the soft grey flesh, and would wish he hadn’t done it. It wasn’t fair to squash the snails after it rained because they came out to play, bathing in the pools under the dripping leaves and stretching out their horns. When he touched their horns they darted back and his hand darted back as well. For snails he was like a grown-up.</i></blockquote><br/>And the venomous, purely perverse relationship of his parents produces gasping lines like<br/><blockquote><i>At the beginning, there had been talk of using some of her money to start a home for alcoholics.

These mere genres are electrified by Murdoch's ethics and filled up with her wit. Like Greene, she is the apotheosis of trash conventions. I feel I am a better person afterward, or at least a better fool. The following derives its power from 200 pages of buildup suddenly letting loose, but it might give you an idea:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>Jealousy is the most natural to us of the really wicked passions... It must be resisted with every honest cunning and with deliberate generous thoughts, however abstract and empty these may seem in comparison with that wicked strength. Think about the virtue that you need and call it generosity, magnanimity, charity. You are young, Jessica, and you are very delightful – may I just take your hand, so? – and the world is not spoilt for you yet. There is no merit, Jessica, in a faithfulness which is poison to you and captivity to him. You have nothing to gain here except by losing. You wish to act out your love, to give it body, but there is only one act left to you that is truly loving and that is to let him go, gently and without resentment.<br/>Put all your, energy into that and you will win from the world of the spirit a grace which you cannot now even dream of. For there is grace, Jessica, there are principalities and powers, there is unknown good which flies magnetically toward the good we know. And suppose that you had found what you were looking for, my dear child? Would you not have been led on from jealousy through deceit into cruelty? Human frailty forms a system, Jessica, and faults in the past have their endlessly spreading network of results. We are not good people, Jessica, and we shall always be involved in that great network, you and I. All we can do is constantly to notice when we begin to act badly, to check ourselves, to go back, to coax our weakness and inspire our strength, to call upon the names of virtues of which we know perhaps only the names. We are not good people, and the best we can hope for is to be gentle, to forgive each other and to forgive the past...</i></blockquote><br/>An essay on the benefits and limits of polyamory; on the trials of self-conscious virtue; an extended gag about virtue's unlikeability.

Except, of course it isn't, because he spoke in the most general possible terms, and the world continues to do unprecedented things and so allow for new commentary and new applications of Plato. It will always be possible to say something new about Plato because, until the heat death draws near, it will be possible to say something new about the world, and criticism should relate the old but general with the new and unanalysed. <br/><br/>This was really deep fun: Goldstein debunks a great deal about him via close-reading (e.g.: that Plato's book, <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Republic_(Plato)"">Πολιτεία</a>, has no etymological or structural relation to modern republics). Some very moving chapters, too, particularly the neuroscientist dialogue: she renders this man we know almost nothing personal about as polite, curious and modest, willing to suspend judgment on e.g. <i>our</i> popular democracy. The titular chapter is best, involving the philosopher wrestling with one imperfect implementation of his epistemocracy, the data-mining Silicon Valley engineer:<br/><blockquote><i>""You're telling me that the purpose of all of this knowledge is merely to make money? Greed is driving the great search engine for knowledge? This bewilders me... How can those who possess all knowledge, which must include the knowledge of the life most worth living, be interested in using knowledge only for the insignificant aim of making money?""<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Plato, I said, I think you have a somewhat exalted view of Google and the nerds who work here."" <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Nerds?"" he said. ""Another word I do not know.""<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, again I was in a somewhat awkward position, since I didn't want to offend Plato, who struck me, despite his eye contact and excellent manners, as a nerd par excellence. So I fell back on something I'd once heard... that the word was originally ""knurd"", which is ""drunk"" spelled backwards, and was used for students who would rather study than party.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""And the people who work here at Google are all nerds?""<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I would say each and every one."" I smiled at him.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and looked around the café as if he had died and gone to philosophers' heaven.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""My chosen term for nerd"", he said, ""is philosopher-king"".<br/></i></blockquote>Goldstein's move for each chapter is to draw out an inconsistency in Plato that later became a persistent philosophical dichotomy; the chapters are all classical dialogues, actually trialogues at least. Also she makes us note how little explanation of modern culture Plato would actually need to be able to deploy his existing arguments. Witty and persuasive.

Hollow like a bell. Marlowe is not presented as feeling anything except incessant fatigue and occasional lust. The prose is fast and somehow innocent though surrounded by darkness:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>    The eighty-five cent dinner tasted like a discarded mail bag and was served to me by a waiter who looked as if he would slug me for a quarter, cut my throat for six bits, and bury me at sea in a barrel of concrete for a dollar and a half, plus sales tax. <br/><br/>    A hand I could have sat in came out of the dimness and took hold of my shoulder and squashed it to a pulp. Then the hand moved me through the doors and casually lifted me up a step. The large face looked at me. A deep soft voice said to me, quietly:<br/>    ""Smokes in here, huh? Tie that for me, pal.""<br/>    It was dark in there. It was quiet. From up above came vague sounds of humanity, but we were alone on the stairs. The big man stared at me solemnly and went on wrecking my shoulder with his hand.<br/>    ""A dinge,"" he said. ""I just thrown him out. You seen me throw him out?"" <br/></i></blockquote><br/>Sure, Noir is cliche now, but we should try to stop Seinfeld effects from undermining original work.

He would be an expert in frustrated love affairs, women who slept alone and didn't like it, wandering boys and girls who didn't write home, sell the property now or hold it for another year, will this part hurt me with my public or make me seem more versatile? Men would sneak in on him too, big strong guys that roared like lions around their offices and were all cold mush under their vests. But mostly it would be women, fat women that panted and thin women that burned, old women that dreamed and young women that thought they might have Electra complexes, women of all sizes, shapes and ages, but with one thing in common—money. No Thursdays at the County Hospital for Mr. Jules Amthor. <br/></i></blockquote><br/><blockquote><i>    ""You lied to me.""<br/>    ""It was a pleasure.""<br/>    He was silent a moment, as if deciding something.

Remember what I told you last night. Don't try getting ideas about this case. All we want from you is silence. Otherwise—""<br/>    He paused.

What skills are scarce? Banks' answer is: ""a lack of scruples; excessive force; the ability to not care."" We should be so lucky.<br/><br/>This scene had a large effect on me as a child:<br/><blockquote><i>'Of course I don't have to do this,' one middle-aged man said, carefully cleaning the table with a damp cloth.

""But look; this table's clean.'<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He agreed that the table was clean.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Usually,' the man said. ""I work on alien -- no offence -- alien religions; Directional Emphasis In Religious Observance; that's my specialty ... like when temples or graves or prayers always have to face in a certain direction; that sort of thing? Well, I catalogue, evaluate, compare; I come up with theories and argue with colleagues, here and elsewhere. But ... the job's never finished; always new examples, and even the old ones get re-evaluated, and new people come along with new ideas about what you thought was settled ... but,' he slapped the table, ""when you clean a table you clean a table. You feel you've done something. It's an achievement.""<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""But in the end, it's still cleaning a table.""<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""And therefore does not really signify on the cosmic scale of events?' the man suggested.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>He smiled in response to the man's grin, ""Well, yes.'<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>'But then what does signify? My other work? Is that really important, either?' <br/>I could try composing wonderful musical works, or day-long entertainment epics, but what would that do? Give people pleasure? My wiping this table gives me pleasure. And people come to a clean table, which gives them pleasure. And anyway"" - the man laughed - ""people die; stars die; universes die. What is any achievement, however great it was, once time itself is dead? Of course, if all I did was wipe tables, then of course it would seem a mean and despicable waste of my huge intellectual potential. But because I choose to do it, it gives me pleasure. And,"" the man said with a smile, ""it's a good way of meeting people.""</i> <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>As did this, before I studied formal philosophy and received a resounding confirmation of it:<br/><blockquote><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Aw, come on; argue, dammit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>“I don’t believe in argument,” he said, looking out into the darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>“You don’t?” Erens said, genuinely surprised. “Shit, and I thought I was the cynical one.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>“It’s not cynicism,” he said flatly. “I just think people overvalue argument because they like to hear themselves talk.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>“Oh well, thank you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>“It’s comforting, I suppose.” He watched the stars wheel, like absurdly slow shells seen at night: rising, peaking, falling...(And reminded himself that the stars too would explode, perhaps, one day.) “Most people are not prepared to have their minds changed,” he said. “And I think they know in their hearts that other people are just the same, and one of the reasons people become angry when they argue is that they realize just that, as they trot out their excuses.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>“Excuses, eh?""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>""Yes, excuses,"" he said, with what Erens thought might just have been a trace of bitterness. ""I strongly suspect the things people believe in are usually just what they instinctively feel is right; the excuses, the justifications, the things you're supposed to argue about, come later. They're the least important part of the belief. That's why you can destroy them, win an argument, prove the other person wrong, and still they believe what they did in the first place."" He looked at Erens. ""You've attacked the wrong thing.” </i></blockquote><br/><br/>But this was also before I got into technical pursuits which lend us hope that the above grim realism can be defeated by self-awareness, quantification, and epistemic care.

Also suddenly, bizarrely, about pre- and post-revolutionary Mexico. <br/><blockquote><i>They were zacateros headed into the mountains to gather chino grass.

It isn't inherent: it depends on subverting your sentimental sense of self, meaning, will, introspection, spirituality; if you don't have these, it won't register. The horror takes unthreatening academic names like ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia"">agnosia</a>"", ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bereitschaftspotential#BP_and_free_will"">readiness potential</a>"", ""<a href=""https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-7/neuroscience-soul"">interhemispheric intrusion</a>"", ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_religion"">neurotheology</a>"", ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_memory"">reconstructive memory</a>"", ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room#Replies"">Chinese room</a>"". (Also ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy_in_the_workplace"">executive psychopath</a>"" though.) <br/>  <br/>The <i>Blindsight</i> ethos - Gothic, fatalist, Darwinist, one of the grandest pessimisms I've ever seen - is what you get when you take a traditional worldview (dualism, free will, work as what dignifies life, human exceptionalism, further-fact identity) and slam the great disenchanting science of a hundred years into it. And then add the coming century's automation and self-modification.<br/><br/>    <i>Blindsight</i> put me in a funk for a week - even though I don't hold any of the positions it sinks. I suppose this is evidence of Watt's talent. (""<i>Art is a nonrational tool for persuasion: beware.</i>"") Not the least of its achievements is maintaining its murky nihilism in a world where <i>friendly superintelligences exist</i>.<br/><br/>    Because of its actual knowledge, this is weird realism, well beyond Lovecraft's. <i>They're coming out of the walls: they're coming out of our best science</i>. The vampires (and, to an extent, the Jovian von Neumann spikefest the plot is about) detract from this deeper horror a bit. Doom; unfixable aberration; people who have warped themselves. If you find <i>Black Mirror</i> a bit too disturbing you might want to give this a miss. Watts even tackles ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliminative_materialism"">illusionism</a>"" - uniquely I think!<br/><br/>    Is it strange that the giant lessons of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution"">cognitive revolution</a> are still rare in fiction? The only explanations I can think of are: simply ""the Two Cultures"" (i.e. novelists are ignorant); or, more discreditable, that novelists are shilling for traditional philosophy, maybe because it sells. (#1 giant lesson: <i>we do not have introspective access to <b>most</b> of what our brains or minds do</i>, on the level of information processing, action, motivation, or even <a href=""http://www.cns.nyu.edu/ledoux/pdf/rethinkingEM.pdf"">emotion</a>. You might say Freud found this out - but he didn't use reliable methods, made huge obvious errors, and created a closed unfalsifiable loop and so did not really have knowledge.)<br/><br/> In contrast, Watts knows a great deal, uses it well, and takes seriously what he knows: for instance, readiness potentials are given all the emotional weight they deserve. This novel has 100 scientific papers listed in the back. The only people who cram quite as many ideas into their books as Watts are Stephenson and Banks.<br/><br/>His scorn for the fumbling entendres of psychoanalysis is also extremely endearing:<br/><blockquote><i>According to the experts of that time, multiple personalities arose spontaneously from unimaginable cauldrons of abuse — fragmentary personae offered up to suffer rapes and beatings while the child behind took to some unknowable sanctuary in the folds of the brain. It was both survival strategy and ritual self-sacrifice: powerless souls hacking themselves to pieces, offering up quivering chunks of self in the desperate hope that the vengeful gods called Mom or Dad might not be insatiable.<br/><br/>None of it had been real, as it turned out. Or at least, none of it had been confirmed. The experts of the day had been little more than witch doctors dancing through improvised rituals: meandering free-form interviews full of leading questions and nonverbal cues, scavenger hunts through regurgitated childhoods. Sometimes a shot of lithium or haloperidol when the beads and rattles didn't work. The technology to map minds was barely off the ground; the technology to edit them was years away. So the therapists and psychiatrists poked at their victims and invented names for things they didn't understand, and argued over the shrines of Freud and Klein and the old Astrologers. Doing their very best to sound like practitioners of Science. </i></blockquote><br/><br><blockquote><i>""So we're fishing for what, exactly? Repressed memories?"" <br/>""No such thing."" She grinned in toothy reassurance. ""There are only memories we choose to ignore, or kinda think around, if you  know what I mean."" </i></blockquote><br/>People diss the prose but I think it fits the ethos incredibly well:<br/><blockquote><i>We fled like frightened children with brave faces. We left a base camp behind: Jack, still miraculously functional in its vestibule; a tunnel into the haunted mansion; forlorn magnetometers left to die in the faint hope they might not. Crude pyronometers and thermographs, antique radiation-proof devices that measured the world through the flex and stretch of metal tabs and etched their findings on rolls of plastic. Glow-globes and diving bells and guide ropes strung one to another... <br/><br/>Inside each of us, infinitesimal lacerations were turning our cells to mush. Plasma membranes sprang countless leaks. Overwhelmed repair enzymes clung desperately to shredded genes and barely delayed the inevitable. Anxious to avoid the rush, patches of my intestinal lining began flaking away before the rest of the body had a chance to die. </i></blockquote><br/>    Siri, the sociopath pinhead, is a great character. But also often an infuriating <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan"">Hollywood Rationalist</a>, and several times he gets the last word which forces me to suspect Watts of it. Though the bit where his girlfriend is dying and he refuses to say anything because it would be cliched is clearly intentionally infuriating for the reader. So might be this stupid bit of game theory:<br/><blockquote><i>""Well, according to game theory, you should never tell anyone when your birthday is.""<br/>""I don't follow."" <br/>""It's a lose-lose proposition. There's no winning strategy."" <br/>""What do you mean, strategy? It's a birthday."" <br/><br/>Look, I'd said, say you tell everyone when it is and nothing happens. It's kind of a slap in the face.<br/>Or suppose they throw you a party, Chelsea had replied. <br/>Then you don't know whether they're doing it sincerely, or if your earlier interaction just guilted them into observing an occasion they'd rather have ignored. But if you don't tell anyone, and nobody commemorates the event, there's no reason to feel badly because after all, nobody knew. And if someone does buy you a drink then you know it's sincere because nobody would go to all the trouble of finding out when your birthday is — and then celebrating it — if they didn't honestly like you. <br/><br/>...I could just... plot out the payoff matrix, Tell/Don't Tell along the columns, Celebrated/Not Celebrated along the rows, the unassailable black-and-white logic of cost and benefit in the squares themselves. The math was irrefutable: the one winning strategy was concealment. Only fools revealed their birthdays.</i></blockquote><br/>- this only follows if you have <i>ridiculously</i> strong error aversion, where the value of being certain about others' opinion of you overrules the pleasantness of ordinary interaction.<br/><br/>    He mentions (but then averts) the single most annoying error when talking about consciousness, which is that ""maybe it's better for the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie"">p-zombie</a> aliens to take over, since they are clearly fitter than us"":<br/><blockquote><i>""It doesn't bug you?"" Sascha was saying. ""Thinking that your mind, the very thing that makes you you, is nothing but some kind of parasite?""<br/>""Forget about minds,"" he told her. ""Say you've got a device designed to monitor — oh, cosmic rays, say. What happens when you turn its sensor around so it's not pointing at the sky anymore, <br/>but at its own guts?"" He answered himself before she could: ""It does what it's built to. It measures cosmic rays, even though it's not looking at them any more. It parses its own circuitry in terms of cosmic-ray metaphors, because those feel right, because they feel natural, because it can't look at things any other way. But it's the wrong metaphor. So the system misunderstands everything about itself. Maybe that's not a grand and glorious evolutionary leap after all. Maybe it's just a design flaw."" </i></blockquote><br/>(Who cares about fitness? A world without qualia is 'Disneyland without children'.)<br/><br/>His Mathesonian attempt to naturalise vampires is <i>kinda</i> clever (they are a subspecies of cannibal savants), and the exemplar vamp Jukka is one of the best characters in the book - but overall their presence is distracting and off-piste; the right-angles epilepsy thing, the revived-by-corporate-greed schtick, more generally holding that corporate culture is putting macroscopic selection pressure to psychopathic nonsentience: all these things jolt me out of his otherwise well-built world.<br/><br/>    Besides the vampires, there are a few more over-the-top ughs. His whole theme of technology as inherently dehumanising, <i>Black Mirror / Event Horizon</i> is just as cherry-picked and annoying as it always is.     The idea that consciousness is unadaptive, and so a one-off aberration in a universe of blind replicators - which steamrolls all objections in the novel - is not obviously true. But it is certainly true either way that our society is currently unadaptive, in the sense of not maximising reproduction. (And thank god for that.)<br/><br/>Wrenching but admirable.

The lack of respect between men, the indifference that allows them to kill others without compunction (as murderers do) or without thinking (as soldiers do), comes from the fact that no one pays due attention to the apparently abstruse idea that other people have souls too.<br/></i></blockquote>",,,1,0

The prose, the humour, the sadness are enough to make you glad, with Patrick, that his parents are dead.<br/><br/>The prose is wonderfully smooth, but I took my time, jolted out every few pages by something demanding reflection: ""Evil is sickness celebrating itself"";<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>    Just as a novelist may sometimes wonder why he invents characters who do not exist and makes them do things which do not matter, so a philosopher may wonder why he invents cases that cannot occur in order to determine what must be the case. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Underneath the filth and irony, Patrick is someone for whom philosophical questions are natural and urgent. The long discursions are more motivated and seamless than in any novel I can think of.<br/><br/>At one point, Mary dismisses the idea that her son's anxiety and angst, so like his father's, could have a genetic component - and assumes that it has inadvertently leaked out of Patrick's behaviour. (She goes on to leave him, actually making a damage-control argument about removing the children from his helpless influence.)<br/><br/>Yes: For all his insight, wit, cynicism, contrarianism, St Aubyn is still stuck in a giant contemporary ideology: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurture_Assumption"">nurture assumption</a>, the culture of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_genetics#Genetic_influences_on_behaviour_are_pervasive"">environment-only development</a> and essential woundedness.<br/><br/>Sure, people get wounded all the time, and being able to say so in public is a great gain, (for one thing, no one in a confessional culture has to assume that they are alone, that their defects are bizarrely theirs. But if trauma is the centre of some people's sense of self - if it is fetishised and even incentivised (e.g. misery memoirs and high-clap Medium posts)... The risks of centring such things are large and underreported: self-fulfilling prophecies, agonising rumination, and the loss of the peace and pleasure of gratitude.<br/><br/>Fine, Aubyn is correct about our sad path-dependence - he's just too recent in placing the start of the path. <a href=""www.wfsbp.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Treatment_Guidelines/Biological_markers_for_anxiety_disorders_OCD_and_PTSD_a_consensus_statement_Part_I_Neuroimaging_and_genetics.pdf"">Here are genetic markers</a> for anxiety and PTSD, against the novel's tacit, almost Freudian emphasis on environment alone.<br/><br/>Aubyn is obviously somewhat detached from his own trauma - you can't write prose this fair and glowing if you're not - which is lucky. Otherwise, the seeker after truth would be senselessly telling the vulnerable they're deluded about their own life. (As we all are, though not in the same ways.)<br/><br/><br/>*<br/>Serious engagement with philosophy of mind throughout:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>    In any case, he now felt in danger all the time. Danger of liver collapse, marital breakdown, terminal fear. Nobody ever died of a feeling, he would say to himself, not believing a word of it, as he sweated his way through the feeling that he was dying of fear. People died of feelings all the time, once they had gone through the formality of materializing them into bullets and bottles and tumours. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>More generally, Patrick actually wrestles with materialism, rather than using the usual literary tricks of caricature and omission on it.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>Curious whether St Aubyn got his vicious rendition of Princess Margaret at <a href=""https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n01/ferdinand-mount/always-the-same-dream"">first- or second-hand</a>.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>The first three chapters of Mother's Milk, told from the perspective of Patrick's first child, are just perfect writing. Robert sees only the benevolence and humour of his parents, not their exhaustion, rage, and bad faith. They are anonymous to him and us, just Robert's mother and Robert's father. It is a glory and a high echelon, though it gives giving the emotional arc of the rest of the book a very long way to fall.<br/><blockquote><br/>    Thomas [2 years old] still knew how to understand the silent language which Robert had almost lost as the wild margins of his mind fell under the sway of a verbal empire. He was standing on a ridge, about to surge downhill, getting faster, getting taller, getting more words, getting bigger and bigger explanations, cheering all the way. Now Thomas had made him glance backwards and lower his sword for a moment while he noticed everything he had lost as well. He had become so caught up in building sentences that he had almost forgotten the barbaric days when thinking was like a splash of colour on a page. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The exaggeration of the wisdom of children is even stronger in Mother's Milk. This is no criticism because St Aubyn isn't very committed to realism, and because Robert's rich and sparkling inner life suits one of the themes: that children deserve to be treated well, taken relatively seriously, as we all do. And that purpose is not the same as result ('telos' indeed):<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>    We think the purpose of a child is to grow up because it does grow up. But its purpose is to play, to enjoy itself, to be a child. If we merely look to the end of the process, the purpose of life is death. <br/></blockquote><br/>The art of kintsugi. ",,,1,0

Of negation, dignity, irrationality, silence, impermeability. <br/><br/>What is Bartleby, if not just depressed or hyper-lazy? Well there’s the defensive Stoic catatonia, or wu wei; Bartleby as crypto-proto-Marxist; Bartleby as waning Übermensch, squatter monk, annoying Christ; Bartleby as dissociating schizophrene or autist; Bartleby as Death of Dead Letters; Bartleby as PTSD ghost; Bartleby as all our inarticulate idiosyncracy, as utter Other – “<i>pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn</i>!” <br/><br/>Some people (e.g. <a href=""http://autonomies.org/ar/2012/12/figures-of-bartlebys-rebellion-2/"">Blanchot</a>, <a href=""http://www.culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/rt/printerFriendly/39/47"">Hardt & Negri</a>, <a href=""http://ideasofimperfection.blogspot.co.uk/2009/10/rest-is-silence.html"">Setiya</a>) view him as heroic, but he’s more hallucinogenic and morbid: he lacks everything but refusal; he throws his life away. And that’s a living death, a non-human void (“I never feel so private as when I know [Bartleby is] here”). <br/><blockquote> <i>So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain point the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but, in certain special cases, beyond that point it does not. They err who would assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness of the human heart. It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of remedying excessive and organic ill. To a sensitive being, pity is not seldom pain. And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot lead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul be rid of it.</i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>That copyists are an extinct breed only adds to the seething flavour; it is <i>possible</i> that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"">OCR</a> and distributed Captchas could have minimised Bartleby’s suffering - that the condition the piece wrangles with isn’t eternal. What would Bartleby be today? Not, I think, an <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/04/occupy-wall-streets-debt-to-melville/256482/"">Occupier</a>; rather a impassive backstreets bookshop owner, or a kombucha stallholder or whatnot. <br/><br/>I prefer to read Melville’s voice - waffling Victorian persiflage - as an assumed decoration for the windbag lawyer’s voice (however much <i>Moby Dick</i> shouts otherwise).",,,1,0

Jefferson:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>what signify a few lives lost in a century or two? the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants. it is it's natural manure.<br/></blockquote></i><br/>(He was pro-Jacobin for a terribly long time.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Try and judge him fairly. How did his actions (not his words lol) compare to the prevailing spirit?:<br/><br/>* <i>Democracy</i>: Well above average, even revolutionary US average.<br/>* <i>Slaves</i>: Hard to say. Inherited 200. Freed only 7. Tried to write a condemnation of slavery into the Declaration. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Ordinance_of_1784"">Wrote a bill</a> banning slavery in new states, narrowly lost the vote. <i>""Even as he yearned to get rid of them, he refused to let them go</i>""<br/>* <i>Native Americans</i>: Average, bad.<br/>* <i>Freedom of speech</i>: Average. Had paid shills in the gutter press throughout his career, and prosecuted enemy journalists for Sedition.<br/>* <i>Freedom of religion</i>: Well above average.<br/>* <i>Women</i>: Average, bad. <br/>* <i>Working-class</i>: Above average in intention, protecting the ""<i>plundered ploughman and beggared yeomanry</i>"". Pretty populist, constantly ranting about bankers and tipping the political balance away from cities.<br/><br/>Jefferson: <blockquote><i>The man must be a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such circumstances.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>His fear of a freedmen uprising apparently paralysed him. The conventional wisdom around 1800 was that you couldn't just free the slaves, you'd also have to deport them (to e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone#Colonial_era_(1800%E2%80%931960)"">Sierra Leone</a> like the British) to prevent them taking their rightful vengeance on the planters.  His turning on the Haitians for similar reasons is one of the saddest and dumbest moments in a life of compromise.<br/><br/>---<br/><blockquote><i>Whatever view one takes of Burke's deepening pessimism and dogmatic adherence to the virtues of Church and King, the fact is that after the summer of 1791 the Jacobins did their best to prove him right.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/><br/>Deleted scene from the Declaration of Independence:<br/><blockquote><i>[King George] has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither.  This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the Christian King of Great Britain.  Determined to keep open a market where Men should be bought & sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or restrain this execrable commerce.  <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>And Hitchen's final exceptionalist thought:<br/><blockquote><i>The French Revolution destroyed itself in Jefferson's own lifetime. More modern revolutions have destroyed themselves and others. If the American Revolution, with its... gradual enfranchisement of those excluded or worse at its founding, has often betrayed itself at home and abroad, it nevertheless remains the only revolution that still retains any power to inspire.""<br/></blockquote></i>",,,1,0

It's one thing to steal almost everything from your people; one thing to demean, torture and murder millions; one thing to employ a large fraction of the entire country as rabid unaccountable secret police. Even if you do all of this, your people still know you're evil and long for your death. It says something about me that the perversion of meaning, the co-optation of language, and erasing the possibility of objectivity is more emotionally taxing than straightforward torture kleptocracy (""<i>say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude...</i>"").<br/><br/>The most appalling figure in Pomerantsev's long list is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov"">Vladislav Surkov</a>. He is at first hard to credit as real: think Russell Brand crossed with Don Draper crossed with Laurentii Beria. His exploits sound like totally mental conspiracy theories, but are actually(?) open secrets:<br/><blockquote><i>... the office of the presidential administration, where Surkov would sit behind a desk with phones bearing the names of all the “independent” party leaders, calling and directing them at any moment, day or night. The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, rendering them absurd. One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions...</i><br/></blockquote><br/>The book is <i>all</i> anecdote. He does state some statistics, but without sourcing; the book has no footnotes. We need to do better than this, what with the Kremlin's online troll army. It is journalism, then, not social theory: a picture of a hundred or so people. Russia is so skewed that one can capture some important things about by focussing on the ultra-powerful: Berezovsky and Putin, Surkov and Deripaska. <br/><br/>Pomerantsev views the ""international development consultants"" trying to improve matters as bumbling, ineffective ambassadors of our best side. <br/><br/>He's very glib in attributing daddy issues, as if psychology were that straightforward, as if Freud were that credible. His prose has the distracting, unbalanced sentences of indifferently translated work (""<i>developers steal so much money during construction that even the most VIP, luxury, elite of the skyscrapers cracks and sink ever so quickly</i>""; ""<i>out to make a few quick quid</i>""). The drama of it all is wearing: he was a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyshockers"">Channel 4-style</a> hack documentarian before becoming a respected literary insider.

Freud done right (""although the explanations in this book may seem Freudian at times, we follow mainstream cognitive psychology in rejecting most of Freud's methods and many of his conclusions""). It's introductory, laced with illustrative anecdotes but with much deeper scholarship underneath.<br/><br/>The 'elephant in the brain' is our unwitting selfishness. We compete without knowing or admitting it, for we are social animals seeking power or status, and thereby sex.<br/><blockquote><br/>    Modeling the world accurately isn't the be-all and end-all of the human brain. Brains evolved to help our bodies, and ultimately our genes, get along and get ahead in the world—a world that includes not just rocks and squirrels and hurricanes, but also other human beings. And if we spend a significant fraction of our lives interacting with others (which we do), trying to convince them of certain things (which we do), why shouldn't our brains adopt socially useful beliefs as first-class citizens, alongside world-modeling beliefs? Wear a mask long enough and it becomes your face. Play a role long enough and it becomes who you are. Spend enough time pretending something is true and you might as well believe it.<br/><br/>    Incidentally, this is why politicians make a great case study for self-deception. The social pressure on their beliefs is enormous. Psychologically, then, politicians don't so much 'lie' as regurgitate their own self-deceptions. Both are ways of misleading others, but self-deceptions are a lot harder to catch and prosecute. <br/></blockquote><br/>Simler undertook the book in lieu of a PhD, and his work is a welcome modification of Hanson's usual relentlessly lucid style: he is more concrete, chattier, more personable.<br/><blockquote><br/>    Information is sensitive in part because it can threaten our self-image and therefore our social image. So the rest of the brain conspires—whispers—to keep such information from becoming too prominent, especially in consciousness. In this sense, the Freuds were right: the conscious ego needs to be protected. But not because we are fragile, but rather to keep damaging information from leaking out of our brain and into the minds of our associates. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>You can probably skip this if you're familiar with Overcoming Bias / LessWrong / Econlog - but even then it's a pleasant read.

The book was originally a <i>New Yorker</i> series, fitting their house style – gossip about the transcendental – but there’s more gossip than concepts. We get to relive all the angry <i>Times</i> responses to bitchy reviews, learn what Toynbee ordered for dinner at the Athenaeum in late ’62; also the hair colour of everyone involved (Murdoch ‘<i>straight and blonde, recalling the peasant aspect of Saint Joan</i>’). To their faces, Mehta is too much the deferential alumn, tentatively prodding the dons to be unkind about their peers. <br/><br/>The humans are worth it, if you already care: Austin and Namier are tragic hubristic husks; Hare, Ayer, and Toynbee’s charisma blare straight through Mehta’s quiet journalism. <br/><br/>The common point between the history and philosophy of the time is both fields' slow recovery from positivism/Wittgensteinian reductionism - the cautious return of theory, and of <i>human</i> posits. (In a sense Wittgenstein was still a reductionist when he was <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations"">a holist</a>, since he obsessed over language even as he denied science's entry into various sides of life.) <br/><br/>Mehta has some spirit: after meeting Strawson (Snr.) he says “I took my leave of the scaled-down Kant.”; he finishes the book with this wonderful medievalism:<br/><blockquote><i>Unless a philosopher finds for us an acceptable faith or synthesis – as Plato and Aristotle did together for their age, and St Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant for theirs – we remain becalmed on a painted ocean of controversy, and for better or worse, insofar as the past is a compass to the future, there will never be anyone to whistle thrice for us and say, once and for all, ‘The game is done!

(Trick question! there's two odds out: the first three had huge positive effects on science and society; while Jobs' and Kissinger's impact on the world is respectively ""eh?"" and ""catastrophic"".)<br/><br/>I don't really understand what people see in Jobs, ""the most beloved billionaire"". He was a turd to just about everyone he met from the age of about 12. <br/><blockquote><i>in the middle of seventh grade he gave his parents an ultimatum. 'I insisted they put me in a different school'. Financially this was a tough demand; his parent were barely making ends meet, but by this point there was little doubt that they would eventually bend to his will.

How much credit does this omnidickery deserve? (I've been told I'm missing the value of management skills, gumption, motivational speaking. OK, then be clear it was this and not innovation, not engineering, not design. Kottke: ""<i>Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person.</i>"". <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20110612071502/http://www.woz.org/letters/general/91.html"">Also the thief.</a>) <br/><br/>In the absence of Jobs, it's hard to see it taking much longer than a couple of years for someone to introduce nice personal computers, computer fonts, portable MP3, heartfelt CGI, or omnisurveillance bricks. And maybe those others wouldn't charge through the nose. Catch the ring of pure mania here:<br/><blockquote><i>'If I had never dropped in on that single [calligraphy] course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. <br/></blockquote></i><br/>I suppose the evidence in favour of him being talented (and not just being lucky and dominating some talented people) is the string of successes (Apple, NeXT, Pixar, Apple). Not a huge sample size, but big in context.<br/><br/>I now have lots of questions, none of which Isaacson raises or settles. (In this regard it's much shallower than either his Einstein or Kissinger books.):<br/><br/>* Could we have gotten the expensive gizmos without all the abuse?<br/><br/>* What <b>was</b> the net effect of his life? <br/>Millions of pretty objects <br/>minus abandoning a child <br/>minus hundreds of petty sneers and little brutalities<br/>minus <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides"">30 suicides</a> ... <br/>I don't see how to do this. People like Design, sure, but how much?<br/><br/>* His personal philosophy seems straightforwardly terrible, all the worst of kneejerk Sixties exoticism. Intuition over reason (""<i>more powerful than intellect</i>""), AND will over sympathy, AND <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924574/"">nature over science</a>, AND post-truth (""[Jobs'] <i>reality distortion field was a confounding melange of charismatic rhetoric, indomitable will, and eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand.</i>"") What's the point of being a 'spiritual being' if you're still a dick afterward?<br/><br/>* Macs are highly underpowered for their price. In theory, this represents a grave loss of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus"">consumer surplus</a>; that is, it loses the point of an economy. But I can't just say that, because people queue up for this stuff. Either they're all exquisite aesthetes who <i>gain</i> surplus by looking at their device during those long extra minutes it takes to finish processing, or the social cachet compensates. I don't have a clear idea of how to judge surplus when computers are not about computing.<br/><br/>* Your view of Gates vs Jobs is very telling. One is uncool and compromising, but has saved <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/14/bill-gates-philanthropy-warren-buffett-vaccines-infant-mortality"">many millions of lives</a>; the other is cool and uncompromising, but, after reading Isaacson, it would not surprise me to hear that none of Jobs' $3.3bn went on philanthropy (it might have been anonymous).<br/><br/>* Do we <i>need</i> reality distorters? Must we be led into greatness by visionary liars and rogues? (Musk has a bit of this too.)<br/><blockquote><i>""If you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told him 'Pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are.""</blockquote></i> Sure is no way that attitude could ever do any harm. I suppose I should just be grateful he stayed out of politics.<br/><br/>Wasn't sure what to rate the book, since it is mostly clear about a dubious subject. Isaacson often stumbles into the Distortion Field <br/><blockquote>""<i>'I think I might have headed to New York if I didn't go to college', [Jobs] recalled, musing on how different his world - and perhaps all of ours - might have been...""</i><br/></blockquote><br/>but <a href=""https://hbr.org/2011/09/steve-jobs-worlds-greatest-phi.html"">a bit less than usual</a>.",,,1,0

A sensitive man betrayed by the terrible course of communism, he goes in for nihilism:<br/><blockquote><i>We were hungry for belief <br/>hope fed us human flesh.</blockquote></i> <br/>(This isn't <i>generally</i> what it feels like to change your mind on something important; it rings of deconversion rather than grudging error-correction.)<br/><br/>Mackay had a <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/sep/02/guardianobituaries.books"">terrible time of it</a>, he suffered without even getting thrilling hubris or an heroic end. Many canonical artists had unusually hard lives and/or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity_and_mental_illness"">mood disorders</a>. But it's not necessarily that sad people write better. Instead here's what I think happens: audiences do not default to being receptive to others: we need to be woken up to a book, whether by personal recommendation, or shared biographical detail, or some other gimmick. A tragic biography is the most reliable primer. (Witness the <a href=""http://theweek.com/article/index/217663/amy-winehouse-and-other-posthumous-sales-booms-by-the-numbers"">death</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_posthumous_number_ones_on_the_UK_Albums_Chart"">bump</a>.) <br/><br/>(It's not nice to attack the <i>hegemony of the sad</i> in art. 1) They are still good, when they're good; 2) they are often Witnesses, speakers-against-power, and anyone can be crushed by having to do that; 3) leave them some bloody consolation!)<br/><br/>I would love Mackay's poems to be incredible; I was extremely moved by Mackay's (self-published) <a href=""http://www.onlineoriginals.com/showitem.asp?itemID=303"">suicide diary</a>. But they're just ok. Of moons, angels, deserts, atomisation, Hendrix. <i>Red Ice</i> was written well before Bosnia (the crowning horror of his life), but it's already overflowing with ruined empathy and snarly emptiness and survivor's guilt. <br/><br/>Are there great paintings in only black and grey? Well, sort of. Calvary features four times in twenty poems. <br/><blockquote><i>the mountains are mere hills <br/>the calvarys are daily and inconspicuous <br/>and we are retreating into closed worlds</blockquote></i><br/><br/>Mackay was trying genocide verse, forty years after <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/adorno/#2"">Adorno</a> and twenty-five after <a href=""http://rinabeana.com/poemoftheday/index.php/2008/07/27/two-formal-elegies-by-geoffrey-hill/"">Geoffrey Hill</a>. (Does it matter, being <i>late</i> to the worst thing ever? No, but do it right, do it new.) The brute fact of the C20th drives him to <a href=""http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/holy-wholly-my-own-1987-by-colin-mackay.html"">nostalgia</a> and lairy isolation <br/><blockquote><i><br/>[I said] I will be me for the hell of it<br/>[he said] you working-class tory<br/>you aren't worth a shit<br/></blockquote></i> <br/><br/>So the poems are chaste, romanticism with the innocent wonder ripped out; unleavened except for his spurious racial memory of everything being ok, once. (Wordsworth at Katyn. I do not think highly of Wordsworth.) The long title poem has automatic force, being as it is about the gulags and the shame of apologism (Lenin and Stalin (and Trotsky and...)). But it's also uncompressed, clumsy with rage (""<i>stop these follies of the human race</i>!""). It condemns by MacDiarmid and Sartre by name, which is rare and ok.

He reads post-punk as far wider than the sombre anti-rock art-school thing people usually take it to be - so he includes Human League and ABC as post-punks with emphasis on the post:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>To varying degrees, all these groups grasped the importance of image, its power to seduce and motivate. And they all coated their music in a patina of commercial gloss, some of them pursuing a strategy of entryism, while others simply revelled in sonic luxury for the sheer glam thrill of it; it's simply inaccurate to portray New Pop, as some histories of the period have, as a 'like punk never happened' scenario. Almost all of the groups had some connection to punk... <br/><br/>New Pop was about making the best of the inevitable - synths and drum machines, video, the return of glamour. Colour, dance, fun and style were sanctioned as both strategically necessary (the terms of entry into pop) and pleasurable (now acceptable, with the rejection of post-punk's guilt-racked puritanism).</i></blockquote><br/><br/>His scope is total: everything's here (except for oi, hardcore, Ramonescore - i.e. the people who failed to make it past punk). Reynolds divides the genre/period in three broad camps:<br/><ol><br/>* <li>modernists (PiL, Cab Vol, No Wave, industrial, SST prog-punk), </li><br/>* <li>post-pop (New Pop, electro, mutant disco, synth) </li><br/>* <li>retro-eclectics (two-tone, Goth, neo-mods).</li><br/></ol><br/><br/>He gives chapters to the Other Places of lC20th popular music: whether Akron (Devo, Pere Ubu), Leeds (Gang of Four, Mekons), Sheffield (Cabaret Voltaire, Human League), Edinburgh (Fire Engines, Josef K, Associates). There is a covert critique of punk (that is, the messianic punks) throughout the book:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>Elsewhere, The Heartbreakers' stodge of refried Chuck Berry was barely more advanced than British pub rock; Dr Feelgood on an IV drip of smack rather than lager...<br/><br/>While the committed activists spouted the textbook party line, a more diffuse left-wing academic culture existed based on a sort of ideological pick 'n' mix: a trendy-lefty autodidactism fuelled by second-hand paperbacks and beginner's guides to Gramsci, Lukacs, and Althusser , garnished with Situationism...<br/><br/>Blending often-incompatible systems of thought, the resulting hodge-podge lacked rigour from the stern standpoint of academics and ideologues alike. But in rock music, a little rigour is rather bracing and galvanising. In the grand tradition of British art-rock, theory helped them achieve the sort of conceptual breakthroughs that more organically evolving groups never reach.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Instead, his favourites are the gorgeous misfits-among-misfits, who managed to be neither modernist nor entryist nor shill: Talking Heads, Meat Puppets, Associates, Japan. Crucially, he is charitable to all the tributaries: chart-hungry post-pop, politically-rabid modernism and the interminable ugliness of Throbbing Gristle, Whitehouse and No Wave: this makes Rip It Up real history rather than hagiography, and so much more than I or anyone has managed.<br/><br/>He has more critical acumen than any of the mooks in the brainy bands; more love than the fey melodists. I have lived in the post-punk woods - too jaded and too hopeful to be a punk - for getting on a decade, and I thought myself a connoisseur: until now I was not. ",,,1,0

Whatever the response, it will never hit the right target, bringing us full satisfaction. The spectacle of America attacking Afghanistan would be just that: If the greatest power in the world were to destroy one of the poorest countries, where peasants barely survive on barren hills, would this not be the ultimate case of the impotent acting out? Afghanistan is already reduced to rubble, destroyed by continuous war during the past two decades. The impending attack brings to mind the anecdote about the madman who searches for his lost key beneath a street light; asked why he searches there, when he actually lost the key in a dark corner, he answers: “But it is easier to search under strong light!” Is it not the ultimate irony that Kabul already looks like downtown Manhattan?<br/><br/> The only way to ensure that it will not happen here again is to prevent it from going on anywhere else. America should learn to humbly accept its own vulnerability as part of this world, enacting the punishment of those responsible as a sad duty, not as an exhilarating retaliation. Even though America’s peace was bought by the catastrophes going on elsewhere, the predominant point of view remains that of an innocent gaze confronting unspeakable evil that struck from the Outside. One needs to gather the courage to recognize that the seed of evil is within us too.<br/></blockquote></i>",,,1,0

We send them death threats, we photoshop them into animal porn, we doxx them, we get them fired. If Ronson's shock and remorse at being part of this could spread, the most distinctive depressing part of modern life would evaporate. <br/><br/>There is only one representative of the online shamers here (besides Ronson, who is reformed). You realise quickly that she is not especially hateful: she's just <i>dim</i> –  she still thinks shaming is great, even after suffering it horribly and losing her job as a result of her own aggressive humourlessness and insensitivity. In her interview with Ronson, she shows no signs of empathy or learning. It is a tragic example of how addling identity can be.<br/><br/>One essential passage - the payload inamongst Ronson's ordinariness and self-deprecation: a human-rights lawyer points out the emotional power of noncriminal acts:<br/><blockquote><i>“Let me ask you three questions,” he said. “And then you’ll see it my way. Question One: What’s the worst thing that you have ever done to someone? It’s okay. You don’t have to confess it out loud. Question Two: What’s the worst criminal act that has ever been committed against you? Question Three: Which of the two was the most damaging for the victim?”<br/><br/>The worst criminal act that has ever been committed against me was burglary. How damaging was it? Hardly damaging at all. I felt theoretically violated at the idea of a stranger wandering through my house. But I got the insurance money. I was mugged one time. I was eighteen. The man who mugged me was an alcoholic. He saw me coming out of a supermarket. “Give me your alcohol,” he yelled. He punched me in the face, grabbed my groceries, and ran away. There wasn’t any alcohol in my bag. I was upset for a few weeks, but it passed.<br/><br/>And what was the worst thing I had ever done to someone? It was a terrible thing. It was devastating for them. It wasn’t against the law.<br/><br/>Clive’s point was that the criminal justice system is supposed to repair harm, but most prisoners — young, black — have been incarcerated for acts far less emotionally damaging than the injuries we noncriminals perpetrate upon one another all the time — bad husbands, bad wives, ruthless bosses, bullies, bankers.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>(It <a href=""http://effective-altruism.com/ea/132/setting_community_norms_and_values_a_response_to/8sv?context=1#8sv"">has been claimed</a> that this phase of internet social justice is on its way out - that the tactic is now to ""<a href=""http://www.humanityinaction.org/files/567-N.Trn-CallingIN.pdf"">call in</a>""- that is, to correct an offender, but also to appeal to the offender's humanity, to try to bridge the gap. We can hope this will gain traction (3 years and counting...). In the meantime a roaring subculture has been founded upon the glorification of bad behaviour and utterly unpersuasive flames.)<br/><br/>Ronson's possible solutions to finding yourself shamed: you can 1) refuse to feel bad (or at least refuse to show them you're bleeding), own the thing they're trying to shame you for, like Max Mosley. This only works sometimes. 2) You can hide from the internet, try to SEO the affair down to Google page 3, where no-one goes, like someone it would be counterproductive to name. 3) You can start over, asking for forgiveness like Jonah Lehrer.

The story of two hardcore spies, American and Boer, who ranged over the eC20th, blowing things up and meeting presidents and dissing Churchill’s fitness level and mining by hand as an anti-fascist action and striking oil and maybe killing lords – who campaigned together to bring an invasive species in to eat another invasive species and introduce a new meat animal to America.

Mooallem reproaches us for having clicked on American Hippopotamus to make fun of the men. But:<br/><blockquote> <i>Rather than diversify and expand our stock of animals, we developed ways to raise more of the same animals in more places. Gradually, that process led to the factory farms and mass-confinement operations we have today—a mammoth industry whose everyday practices and waste products are linked to all kinds of dystopian mayhem, from the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, to a spate of spontaneous abortions in Indiana, to something called blue baby syndrome, in which infants actually turn blue after drinking formula mixed with tap water that’s been polluted by runoff from nearby feedlots. That same runoff also sloshes down the Mississippi River to its mouth, pooling into one of the world’s biggest aquatic dead zones, seven or eight thousand square miles large at times...<br/><br/> These aren’t problems that America created so much as ones we’ve watched happen — consequences of our having ducked other, earlier problems by rigging together relatively unambitious solutions that seemed safe enough. We answered the Meat Question. But there were more meat questions ahead. <br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Simple, thoughtful, astonishingly well-written.",,,1,0

An empirically rigorous angry manifesto! <br/><br/>Here are all of the book's theses in one paragraph, which is another thing I love nonfiction writers doing:<br/><blockquote><i>Drugs are tested by the people who manufacture them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques that are flawed by design, in such a way that they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don’t like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug’s true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug’s life, and even then they don’t give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion. <br/><br/>In their forty years of practice after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works ad hoc, from sales reps, colleagues and journals. But those colleagues can be in the pay of drug companies – often undisclosed – and the journals are, too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, we have no idea what the best treatment is, because it’s not in anyone’s financial interest to conduct any trials at all. These are ongoing problems, and although people have claimed to fix many of them, for the most part they have failed; so all of these programs persist, but worse than ever, because now people can pretend that everything is fine after all.</i><br/><br/>[Low external validity] <i>can make a trial completely irrelevant to real-world populations, yet it is absolutely routine in research, which is conducted on tight budgets, to tight schedules, for fast results, by people who don’t mind if their results are irrelevant to real-world clinical questions. This is a quiet, dismal scandal. There’s no dramatic newspaper headline, and no single killer drug: just a slow and unnecessary pollution of almost the entire evidence base in medicine.</i> <br/></blockquote><br/>Exactly as fair to pharma as it deserves and no more (""there is no medicine without medicines"").

But the following affirmation of mythos here is more or less my view:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>I'm still agnostic. But in the words of Elton Richards, I'm now a reverant agnostic. Which isn't an oxymoron, I swear. I now believe that whether or not there's a God, there is such a thing as sacredness. Life is sacred. The Sabbath can be a sacred day. Prayer can be a sacred ritual. There is something transcendent, beyond the everyday. It's possible that humans created this sacredness ourselves, but that doesn't take away from its power or importance.</i> <br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>Literalism is impossible, immoral and inconsistent with our new, better picture of the world; biblical liberalism is mercenary and inconsistent with itself.

Of: contemporary sexuality, cereal adverts, the implications of the 00s pirate craze, questions in general, the Unabomber’s good point. Klosterman’s not going to get away without comparison to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace"">DFW</a> – but he’s really good in his own way too. He’s a more relaxed, atheoretical Wallace, with pop music (rather than Art writing) at his core, and technology (rather than general Irony) as the source of his worries about us all. <br/><br/>This slices through the reflexivity that causes modern confusions, while being mischievously reflexive himself (at one point he tells us that he once lied to an interviewer who had correctly identified Klosterman’s mouthpiece in one of his novels; Klosterman denied that he shared the character’s view in order to preserve a cheap narrative uncertainty for readers of the interview – but, of course, admitting that here undoes that cheap save for we third-order readers). <br/><br/>Applied instance: <blockquote>“<i>We assume that commercials are not just informing us about purchasable products, because that would be crude and ineffective. We’re smarter than that. But that understanding makes us more vulnerable. We’ve become the ideal audience for advertising—consumers who intellectually magnify commercials in order to make them more trenchant and clever than they actually are. Our fluency with the language and motives of the advertiser induces us to create new, better meanings for whatever they show us. We do most of the work for them.</i>”</blockquote> <br/>Two quibbles: there is (what I take to be) a lack of ideological care you’d expect of pieces written for <i>Esquire</i> magazine. He doesn’t resolve (as I think DFW mostly does) the tension between a) affirming low culture’s power and unique charms against bullshit classist disparagement, and b) despising its crudest, most conservative common denominators. <br/><br/>Went through it in an hour. <br/>",,,1,0

Also, the title is cool but misleading, since they don't actually go in to the plausible claim that the West's foreign policy has been terroristic, and since I don't think drones come up at all.) It is selective as history and nearly worthless as economics, but I do not begrudge Chomsky continuing his fifty-year marathon of talking about covert realpolitik: these sorts of manipulations are almost unreported at the time, go wholly unpunished, and are rapidly forgotten. <br/><br/>Like what? Well, begin with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State#Humanitarian_disaster"">Leopold II</a>, skip to the Enola Gay, or Britain's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine_(legal_instrument)"">Palestine</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"">Operation Boot</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_PBFORTUNE"">Operation PBFORTUNE</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba#Foreign_involvement_in_his_death"">Lumumba</a>, the <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/laos/1478626/History-haunts-the-Plain-of-Jars.html"">Plain of Jars</a>, and the long systematic atrocity ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor#U.S._involvement"">Operation Condor</a>"" (involving us and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinochet#U.S._backing_of_the_coup"">Pinochet</a>, Noriega and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama"">Just Cause</a>, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/28/indonesia.world"">Suharto</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War#United_States_involvement"">El Salvador</a>), or that Iraq matter.<br /><br /><br/>But even though it handles these real crimes, <i>On Western Terrorism</i> turns out to be an echo-chamber - a mix of apparently detailed research (e.g. they appeal to some 'declassified embassy reports' to back up some claims) and pervasive confirmation bias. <br/><br/>The main problem's exaggeration. In one breath they move from a righteous skit on the original colonial genocides to a view of world politics in which <i>everything</i> that happens now is the outcome of decisions in Brussels and Washington. From “The West has, historically and recently, been hypocritically violent and anti-democratic” to “Everything bad in the world is due to the West”. That sounds like a sure straw man, but here’s the man himself:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>The great majority of events that were causing the suffering of countless human beings all over the world were related to greed, to the desire to rule and to control coming almost exclusively from the ‘old continent’ and its powerful but ruthless offspring on the other shore.</i></blockquote> (Oh? malaria? dysentery? precarious subsistence farming? Hutu-on-Tutsi genocide?) He’s at it again here: <br/><blockquote><i>although it is mostly Rwanda, Uganda who are murdering millions of innocent [Congolese] people, behind this are always Western geopolitical and economic interests.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Well. It's true that, as well as the flat-out murders in the links above, our governments bear shame for ignoring <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_war"">unbelievably destructive</a> ongoing wars in e.g. the Congo. But failing to prevent murder is not murder, nor necessarily accessory to - especially if we remember that C&V’s judicious attitude to military intervention would have precluded direct action anyway. There is a logical chasm between what one could only <i>perhaps</i> prevent - given enough luck and blood - and what one is the cause of. (I agree that the two situations place similar responsibilities on us, by the way - but in the absence of simple solutions, that hypothetical responsibility does not make them the same.) Similarly: capitalism produces enormous inequality but <a href=""http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2011$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=0AkBd6lyS3EmpdHo5S0J6ekhVOF9QaVhod05QSGV4T3c;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL%5Fn5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=194;dataMax=96846$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=55;dataMax=108111$map_s;sma=50;smi=2$cd;bd=0$inds="">mostly inadvertently relieves poverty</a>: poverty is our default from before there <i>was</i> a world-system. But C&V and others of the demagogic school persist in blaming all the world's ills on rich bores whose uncaring exploitation often works better for the poor than altruistic direct action. (This is very counterintuitive; so much for intuition.)<br/><br/>Why do I disagree? They say it’s cos I’m a dupe: <br/><blockquote><i>There have been very sophisticated propaganda systems developed in the last hundred years and they colonized minds including the minds of the perpetrators. That’s why the intellectual classes in the West generally can’t see it.</i></blockquote> <br/>I say it’s because while their description of our foreign policy is (depressingly) fair, on the foreign policy of rival governments they are uncritical, whitewashing, and on historical alternatives to our type of society they are naive and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking_(fallacy)"">cherry-picking</a>, where they give evidence at all. What might a real radical say in response to my aspersions? ""Fuck balance! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGArqoF0TpQ"">Balance</a> is what lets them get away with it! Fuck evidence! Evidence is what makes people think I’m wrong!"" <br/><br/>Vltchek is much more skewed than Chomsky. He’s earnest, and clearly devoted to <a href=""http://andrevltchek.weebly.com/films.html"">first-hand reporting</a> of the abuse of powerless people. But, oddly, depressingly, this immersion in the frontline has robbed him of perspective (and in fact it doesn't get more front-line: he was tortured in East Timor in 1996). He suffers the defining mistake of recent leftism: the enemy of my enemy error, where  you'll approve of anyone who resists the West. In fact, his comments, taken over the whole book, amount to a flirting defence of totalitarianism - he romanticises the Soviets, Assad's Syria, and <a href=""http://www.hrw.org/world-report-%5Bscheduler-publish-yyyy%5D/world-report-2014-ecuador"">Ecuador</a>. Both of them exchange the Eurocentric rose-tint of our mainstream for lenses warped in the reverse direction. And it all rests, ultimately, on tacit belief in the <a href=""http://tomtalkspolitics.wordpress.com/2009/12/07/bertrand-russells-the-superior-virtue-of-the-oppressed/"">'superior virtue of the oppressed</a>' - the strange belief that being bombed makes the bomb recipient better than you. (Sure, they’re probably more virtuous than the bombers, but that’s not saying much.) Our governments being awful does not mean that others are not. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization"">Quite the reverse</a>.<br/><br/>Also: Chomsky bashes the 'Black Book' of Communism not by challenging its accounting, but by saying that Western capitalism's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque"">toll was worse</a> (no footnote, but see the lone India example below); and the Prague Spring is utterly minimised with the same ugly break-a-few-eggs fallacy. Vltchek: <br/><blockquote><i>Moscow’s invasion of 1968 to put down the Prague Spring was not necessarily something that should have happened... but there was no massacre performed by the Soviets; few people fell under the tanks. Most of what happened was accidents; some people who died were drunk.</i> </blockquote><br/>(The direct death toll was 72 plus suicides, if that's what he means.) <br/><br/>That’s the first big problem. The other huge one is the <i>complete</i> lack of footnotes, even as they make the boldest possible claims. As a result, even I identified some errors in the course of my single superficial reading. (Ok, so some failings are just the vagaries of live dialogue as compared to writing; but Vltchek (or Pluto Press at least) would be forgiven for editing the damn thing for basic evidence.)<br/><br/>The only research cited in support of the claim that capitalism causes more excess death from starvation is Dreze and Sen's reputable 1981 study 'Hunger and Public Action (<a href=""http://www.polsci.ucsb.edu/faculty/glasgow/ps15/DrezeSen.pdf"">p.214 here</a>). C&V use this to compare excess deaths in India (as an instance of a market democracy) in 1947-1979 with that of Communist China, pointing out that Dreze and Sen place the toll in India at some <i>100</i> million, next to China’s '25-30' million. (First cockup: citing thirty-year-old research underestimates the toll of Mao’s famine by perhaps <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao's_Great_Famine#Criticism"">20m people</a>.) But the comparison doesn't do the work they put it to (that is, condemning capitalism): India was almost an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarkic"">autarkic</a> <a href=""http://www.google.co.uk/url?url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS022.pdf&rct=j&frm=1&q=&esrc=s&sa=U&ei=CjO8U875JIjsOoKzgMAB&ved=0CBQQFjAA&sig2=jPPsJmQt057fqArKrMJ3kg&usg=AFQjCNGPlxtds0U9r_FEXHEoKaHEaeiSuA"">command economy</a> (in which perhaps two-thirds of all formal, non-subsistence employment was public-sector) in that period; it does not serve them as an exemplar of neoliberal starvation. <br/><br/>Even if it did, we would again come up against their curious equation of <i>failure to prevent an intractable thing</i> with causing the thing in the first place. As far as I can tell, their reasoning really is: “Capitalism exists, and poverty exists, so, capitalism causes poverty.” But it would take one of two things for capitalism to be responsible for poverty: causation, as evidenced by e.g. <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/06/economist-explains-0"">a gross increase</a> in the number of poor people under its penumbra; or its impeding a more effective solution to poverty. But the proportion of (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty#Absolute_poverty"">utterly</a>) poor people, in this supremely Late-capitalist world is the lowest it has ever been; and the remaining poverty is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_Billion"">not at all simple to fix</a>; and capitalist countries really did try, throwing <a href=""http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/01/23/aid_amnesia"">enormous amounts of money and thought</a> at the problem for going-on 70 years. <br/><br/>To be responsible for poverty in the way C&V say, either capitalism or old socialism would have to be omnipotent, and - among other fairly strong disconfirmations for that idea - the 20th century shows both of those to be untrue. (The <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Chomsky-book-a-best-seller-after-Chavez-speech-2469244.php"">commercial success</a> of Chomsky in his enormously capitalist society, is an extra data point toward rubbishing any strong statement about capitalism's mind-control powers.)<br/><br/>(Vltchek talks about global warming briefly, and I was about to reach for the <a href=""http://www.rtcc.org/2012/03/12/kiribati-president-rejects-climate-change-evacuation-stories/"">recent debunking</a> of claims of Polynesian evacuation – but in fact it turns out his sources were better; the president of Kiribati has <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/01/kiribati-climate-change-fiji-vanua-levu"">since publicly floated</a> a national evac plan.)<br/><br/>A less straightforward quibble: they think this book is about the West, I think it’s about humans with power.<br/><br/>I had believed Chomsky more humane than this talk makes him seem (see for example his <a href=""http://www.spectrezine.org/global/chomsky.htm"">sombre 90s piece</a> on the Black Book) - that is, I want to pin the blame for this biased and maudlin tract on Vltchek. But <a href=""http://www.monbiot.com/2012/05/21/see-no-evil/"">his long-standing dismissal</a> of some non-Western massacres at last makes me wonder.<br/><br/>On a less uninspired and dispiriting note: if there is a system less bad than Swedish capitalism, it does not exist in the past. So it must be invented, negotiated, and tested. Chomsky and the other socially enraged <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostalgie"">ostalgiacs</a> in his ambit are not mostly doing that; <a href=""http://crookedtimber.org/2013/03/22/on-erik-olin-wrights-envisioning-real-utopias-diane-coyle/"">Erik Olin Wright</a> and <a href=""http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/a-practical-utopians-guide-to-the-coming-collapse"">David Graber</a> and <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/feminism-capitalist-handmaiden-neoliberal"">Nancy Fraser</a> and others are at least trying.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>Finally, what’s so bad about being excessive and dogmatic in your criticism of awful things? (Why should anti-oppression efforts need to justify themselves? They're anti-oppression!) Well, apart from it being dangerous and ignoble to be so firmly wrong, taking this tack means that your true conclusions will be dismissed as just more of your typical excesses. <br/><br/>But even given their slips, hyperbole, and complacency, there’s no way around <i>some</i> of C&V's key claims: Our governments have not in general been a positive force in the rest of the world; this is not well-known within our societies; as long as <a href=""https://www.globalpolicy.org/us-un-and-international-law-8-24/us-opposition-to-the-icc-8-29.html"">the US is</a> <a href=""http://www.globalissues.org/article/490/united-states-and-the-icc"">legally immune</a> from prosecution, international justice is a joke; we have often given money and guns to the worst people in the world; we did this for little more than control and for stuff.

Important quibble: The title evokes sexy French relativism – e.g. there is no fact of the matter, il n’y a pas de hors-texte – whereas his actual thesis is that only the strictest, stupidest partition between facts and values collapsed. (A distinction is the mild statement that A is not the same thing as B – whereas a dichotomy is the strict logical exclusion of two things: ‘if something is A, it is a priori not B’.) A pedantic quibble: god he is fond of italics. <br/><br/>Anyway. It collapsed, but still lives on in other fields, decades after the fall of the positivism that was the only thing motivating it. Book is: a scathing modern history of the distinction, a Pragmatic reconstruction, a love letter to Amartya Sen. Putnam blames the philosophical dichotomy for the failures of economics, and from there for real suffering. <br/><blockquote><br/> <i>The word “cruel”... has a normative and indeed, ethical use.  If one asks me what sort of person my child’s teacher is, and I say ""he is very cruel,"" I have both criticized him as a teacher and…as a man.  I do not have to add, ""he is not a good teacher"" or ""he is not a good man.""  I cannot simply... say, ""he is a very cruel person and a good man,"" and be understood.  Yet ""cruel"" can also be used purely descriptively, as when a historian writes that a certain monarch was exceptionally cruel, or that the cruelties of the regime provoked a number of rebellions.  ""Cruel"" simply ignores the supposed fact/value dichotomy and cheerfully allows itself to be used sometimes for a normative purpose and sometimes as a descriptive term.  (Indeed, the same is true of the term ""crime."")</i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Some claims: Factual and evaluative statements are necessarily entangled, since; Facts are ascertained <i>as such</i> only by the application of epistemic values: ""coherence, plausibility, reasonableness, simplicity, and elegance... if these epistemic values do enable us to correctly describe the world... that is something we see through the lenses of those very values.""; i.e. facts are thick too; i.e. he has been made to ""<i>rethinking the whole dogma (the last dogma of empiricism?) that facts are objective and values are subjective</i>"". Of course, coupled to his ditching foundationalism, this leads him a long way down the Rortyan road - 'science is just another social practice' yada yada - but he tries to salvage a sort of pragmatic objectivity for science.

But I was hostile to this at first – mostly because her field helped breed a generation of pseuds who use ‘reductionism’ as an insult (rather than as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model"">a straightforward fact</a>, or a useful way of thinking, instances of which denote the highest achievements of the species). Let's get clear:<br/><blockquote><br/> “REDUCTIONISM” (to the pseud): The claim that complicated or immeasurable things do not exist.<br/> “SYSTEMS THEORY” (to the pseud): The only way of understanding things: as a whole. Everything else omits and so isn't full.<br/> <br/> REDUCTIONISM (ontology): The claim that complicated things are made of simpler things. Only the simplest of them are physically real; the rest are mental models of their interactions.*<br/> REDUCTIONISM (methodology): The attempt to isolate causes and treat phenomena in terms of their most basic units (whether quark, string, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodological_individualism"">person</a>, transaction).<br/> SYSTEMS THEORY: When things get together, they exhibit features the individual things don’t.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>So stated, there is no conflict between good old reduction and shiny systems thinking. But Meadows distils the juicy bits into &lt;200pp here, and freely admits that systems theory has an intractable indeterminacy built into it, and says this, too:<br/><blockquote> <i>Ever since the Industrial Revolution, Western society has benefited from science, logic, and reductionism over intuition and holism. Psychologically and politically we would much rather assume that the cause of a problem is “out there,” rather than “in here.” It’s almost irresistible to blame something or someone else, to shift responsibility away from ourselves, and to look for… the technical fix that will make a problem go away.<br/><br/> Serious problems have been solved by focusing on external agents — preventing smallpox, increasing food production, moving large weights and many people rapidly over long distances. Because they are embedded in larger systems, however, some of our “solutions” have created further problems… Hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, economic instability, unemployment, chronic disease, drug addiction, and war, for example, persist in spite of the analytical ability and technical brilliance that have been directed toward eradicating them. No one deliberately creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist nonetheless.<br/><br/> That is because they are intrinsically systems problems – undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that produce them. They will yield only as we reclaim our intuition, stop casting blame, see the system as the source of its own problems, and find the courage and wisdom to restructure it.<br/></blockquote></i><br/><br/>Can it <i>resolve</i> empirical questions the way physics does, though? In saying, probably rightly, that a flow could go either way, depending on the state of the rest of the system and neighbouring systems, you lose or sideline <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimentum_crucis"">crucial</a> power to find out a single cause's influence, and thereby know more or less exactly what to <i>do</i> to the system. In other places, knowledge comes from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus"">isolating causes</a>. A reductionist can agree with all the clever diagrams in this, happily concede that they <i>illustrate</i> the gnarly problems of collective action and feedback and other ecosystems very clearly - and not give up their peerlessly successful method / ontological stance at all. <br/><br/><br/><br/><blockquote>* Also<br/>PHYSICALISM: Everything is made of physical things.

Its irreverence is not mostly directed at Kafka, despite the aggressive-seeming title. <br/><br/><i>IM</i> relies heavily on lighting, juxtaposition, and Daniel Day-Lewis' tics. Either play is much more likely to endear Kafka to you than his own books, or any of the absurd battery of critical texts on him. <br/><br/>This is my favourite thing on Kafka:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>There are many perils in writing about Kafka. His work has been garrisoned by armies of critics with some fifteen thousand books about him at the last count. As there is a Fortress Freud so is there a Fortress Kafka, Kafka his own castle. For admission a certain high seriousness must be deemed essential and I am not sure I have it. One is nervous about presuming even to write his name, wanting to beg pardon for doing so, if only because Kafka was so reluctant to write his name himself. Like the Hebrew name of God, it is a name that should not be spoken, particularly by an Englishman. In his dreams Kafka once met an Englishman. He was in a good grey flannel suit, the flannel also covering his face... The Channel is a slipper bath of irony through which we pass these serious Continentals in order not to be infected by their gloom. This propensity I am sure I have not escaped or tried to: but then there is something that is English about Kafka, and it is not only his self-deprecation. A vegetarian and fond of the sun, he seems a familiar crank; if he’d been living in England at the turn of the century, and not in Prague, one can imagine him going out hiking and spending evenings with like-minded friends in Letchworth...<br/><br/>In that department [DIY] certainly Kafka did not excel. He was not someone you would ask to help put up a shelf, for instance, though one component of his charm was an exaggerated appreciation of people who could, and of commonplace accomplishments generally. Far from being clumsy himself (he had something of the dancer about him), he would marvel (or profess to marvel) at the ease with which other people managed to negotiate the world. This kind of professed incompetence (‘Silly me!’) often leads to offers of help, and carried to extremes it encourages the formation of unofficial protection societies. Thus Kafka was much cosseted by the ladies in his office and in the same way the pupils of another candidate for secular sainthood, the French philosopher Simone Weil, saw to it that their adored teacher did not suffer the consequences of a practical un-wisdom even more hopeless than Kafka’s.<br/><br/>One cannot say that Kafka’s marvelling at mundane accomplishments was not genuine, was a ploy. The snag is that when the person doing the marvelling goes on to do great things this can leave those with the commonplace accomplishments feeling a little flat. Say such a person goes on to win the Nobel Prize: it is scant consolation to know that one can change a three-pin plug.<br/><br/>Gorky said that in Chekhov’s presence everyone felt a desire to be simpler, more truthful and more oneself. Kafka too had this effect. ‘On his entrance into a room,’ wrote a contemporary, ‘it seemed as though some unseen attendant had whispered to the lecturer: “Be careful about everything you say from now on. Franz Kafka has just arrived.” ’ To have this effect on people is not an unmixed blessing. When we are on our best behaviour we are not always at our best.<br/><br/>This is not to say that Kafka did not make jokes in life and in art. The Trial, for instance, is a funnier book than it has got credit for and Kafka’s jokes about himself are the better for the desperate circumstances in which they were often made. He never did win the Nobel Prize but contemplated the possibility once in fun and in pain, and in a fairly restricted category (though one he could have shared with several contemporaries, Proust, Katherine Mansfield and D.H. Lawrence among them). When he was dying of TB of the larynx he was fetching up a good deal of phlegm. ‘I think,’ he said (and the joke is more poignant for being so physically painful to make), ‘I think I deserve the Nobel Prize for sputum.’ Nothing if not sick, it is a joke that could have been made yesterday.<br/><br/>Dead sixty-odd years, Kafka is still modern and there is much in the present-day world to interest him. These days Kafka would be intrigued by the battery farm and specifically, with an interest both morbid and lively, in the device that de-beaks the still-living chickens; in waste-disposal trucks that chew the rubbish before swallowing it; and those dubious restaurants that install for your dining pleasure a tank of doomed trout. As the maître d’ assists the discerning diner in the ceremony of choice, be aware of the waiter who wields the net: both mourner and executioner, he is Kafka. He notes old people in Zimmer frames stood in their portable dock on perambulatory trial for their lives. He is interested in the feelings of the squash ball and the champagne bottle that launches the ship. In a football match his sympathy is not with either of the teams but with the ball or, in a match ending nil-nil, with the hunger of the goalmouth... he would be concerned with the current debate on the disposal of nuclear waste. To be placed in a lead canister which is then encased in concrete and sunk fathoms deep to the floor of the ocean was the degree of circulation he thought appropriate for most of his writing. Or not, of course...<br/><br/>Had Kafka the father emigrated to America as so many of his contemporaries did, things might have turned out differently for Kafka the son. He was always stage-struck. Happily lugubrious, he might have turned out a stand-up Jewish comic. Kafka at Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Why didn’t Kafka stutter? The bullying father, the nervous son – life in the Kafka household seems a blueprint for a speech impediment. In a sense, of course, he did stutter. Jerky, extruded with great force and the product of tremendous effort, everything Kafka wrote is a kind of stutter. Stutterers devise elaborate routines to avoid or to ambush and take by surprise troublesome consonants, of which K is one of the most difficult. It’s a good job Kafka didn’t stutter. With two Ks he might have got started on his name and never seen the end of it. As it is, he docks it, curtails it, leaves its end behind much as lizards do when something gets hold of their tail.<br/><br/>...Hermann Kafka has had such a consistently bad press that it’s hard not to feel a sneaking sympathy for him as for all the Parents of Art. They never get it right. They bring up a child badly and he turns out a writer, posterity never forgives them – though without that unfortunate upbringing the writer might never have written a word. They bring up a child well and he never does write a word. Do it right and posterity never hears about the parents: do it wrong and posterity never hears about anything else.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>You do not necessarily need to read <i>Kafka's Dick</i> after reading that.",,,1,0

But it's as much moral as geographic or historical. China had only just opened up to foreigners, again; the Cultural Revolution, just 15 years past, looms large. A lost generation. In fact the book is obsessed with the difficult question, ""How could they do that to themselves?"", a focus which makes it excellent, informal long-form journalism as much as gentleman's what-ho travel narrative.<br/><blockquote><i>The man went on: 'We found a porter who had been reading novels with a love interest. I don't mean porn. Just a personal story. This was decadent. We beat him unconscious, and burnt the books. Then he died.'<br/>I looked at him in astonishment, mesmerised, for some reason, by his immaculately pressed trousers. Once the armour of social constraint had been stripped from him, the person inside had been exposed as a baby: conscienceless. Was that China, I wondered, or just him? In any case, where was that feeling of pity which Mencius said was common to all men? </i></blockquote><br/>The question isn't as simply answered as <a href=""http://www.clivejames.com/evenaswespeak/hitler"">it is for Hitler's Germany</a> (answer: ""Because the merest dissent by any German meant death"") nor even as it is for Stalinist Russia (since the unbelievable violence of the Holodomor and gulags was meted out by a <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/NKVD"">comparatively small number of people</a>). Millions of educated Red Guards brutalised millions of untrendy people without much central control at all (indeed, they often revolted against and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Guards_%28China%29#Role_in_the_Cultural_Revolution"">scared the shit out</a> of the PLA and the apparatchiks).<br/><br/>Thubron's important points include: that the Party cadres are nothing more than the latest garb of the long, long line of elite mandarins. So the poor <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Baixing"">Laobaixing</a> got all the downside of an absolutist bureaucracy <i>plus</i> all the incompetence and terror caused by people who think that violent unending revolution is desirable. Another large theme is the appalling state of women: The patriarchy there was without even the paltry sweetener of chivalry - married off at 14 if not murdered as infants; old women sitting in the aisles of busses while young men lounge, etc, etc. <br/><br/>Many of the people he meets (mostly lower-middle-class) were (<a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hukou_system"">are</a>?) unbelievably obsessed with class, even after forty years of 'communist' rule; the brief, cursory glorification of the nongmin bounced back as soon as the big sticks went away. He calculates the cost of things - TVs, train tickets, hotel whiskies - in that most decent of measures, fractions of an average worker's monthly wage. <br/><br/>There is, already in 1987, an ambitious, irreverent, apolitical youth which any graduate of a Western university will now recognise readily.** The modern Modern China - Deng's China - is visible here, just. Thubron watches the future radiating out from the city:<br/><blockquote><i>Under the enormous vault of the station hall there resounds the tramp of a newly mobilised peasantry. I have seen them before all over the city: families arrived to buy or trade, sleeping under bridges or in shop porches with cap over their eyes. Now they step on to the escalators as gingerly as Western eight-year-olds, laden with rope-trussed boxes, newly bought televisions, chickens in hampers, radios, bags spilling out fruit and biscuits - bearing El Dorado back to the village. They overflow the waiting-rooms and camp against every wall behind their baggage palisades, snoring open-mouthed through the din with the detachment of Brueghel swineherds, their children in their arms.</i></blockquote><br/>His wit, compassionate anger, gravitas, and grasp of the detail of how messily old collides with new: all recall my favourite critic, Jonathan Meades. (Though Meades is a bit too refined to be easily imagined sleeping fifth-class amidst spit and melon rind, or buying a barn owl in a meat market just to set it free.)<br/><br/>He reports much local bullshit, sarcastically (e.g. Northerners' notion that 'moral integrity' decreases as you go south). This makes it sometimes difficult to know which reportage he endorses: thus, a couple of outlandish claims are possibly deadpan jokes (e.g. only '100' cars on mainland China in 1987?? Human flesh on sale in Canton?<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, the book received a dab of cursory post-colonial critique.* This is unsurprising because he is interested in <i>testing</i> stereotypes out - in particular, finding out if innate cruelty enabled the Cultural Revolution; it is thus not unfair to imagine the book as a Eurocentric hatchet job. But this dismissive cynicism is only possible <i>before</i> you've heard his frank encounters with a hundred vivid, intelligent, and mournful locals, seen his solid grasp of the history of the dynasties and of 'pedantic and kindly' Confucianism. (Which is the best description of it I've ever seen.) <br/><br/>Those interviews <i>are</i> novelistic - impossibly sincere, compressed, tragic, poetic - and far beyond anything I could elicit as a foreigner, in my summer there. But you believe him even so. Anyway he doesn't pretend to have answered his burning question:<br/><blockquote><i>'This sort of thing isn't peculiar to my country,' the priest said: he might have been thought-reading. 'Look at Germany, Russia. Of course, those countries are not old civilisations like ours, but still...'<br/><br/>Of course. I was wading into an ocean. He was listening patiently, but I could not assemble any coherent thoughts. I wanted to explain that it was not the presence of cruelty which surprised me, but some imbalance between obedience and mercy, the collapse of domestic compassion in the face of official demand, the refinements of tortures practiced against teachers and friends, the denunciation of parents - but I stumbled into inarticulacy. I was juggling only with my own values, not with theirs. I knew nothing.</i> <br/></blockquote><br/>I oughtn't skimp on the book's adventure-story side just because it happens to be a beautiful and humane psychological portrait; the prose is persistently gorgeous, the sights are dryly and comprehensively evoked, and Thubron presents himself as a very fine comic character to boot.

Bravura. <br/><br/>How did he get from there to chilling with Wolfowitz? Well, on some points Hitchens didn't change at all; the Left did:<br/><blockquote><br/>[In 1968] <i>people began to intone the words “The Personal Is Political”. The instant that I first heard this deadly expression, I knew as one does from the utterance of any sinister bullshit that it was very bad news. From now on, it would be enough to a member of a sex or gender, or epidermal subdivision, or erotic “preference”, to qualify as a revolutionary. In order to begin a speech or ask a question from the floor, all that would be necessary by way of preface would be the words, “Speaking as a…” Then could follow any self-loving description. I will have to say this for the old “hard” Left: we earned our claim to speak and intervene by right of experience and sacrifice and work. It would never have done for any of us to stand up and say that our sex or sexuality or pigmentation of disability were qualifications in themselves. There are many ways of dating the moment where the Left lost or – I would prefer to say – discarded its moral advantage, but this was the first time I was to see the sell-out so cheaply.</i><br/><br/><i>the Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwah... was, if I can phrase it like this, a matter of everything I hated versus everything I loved. In the hate column: dictatorship, religion, stupidity, demagogy, censorship, bullying, and intimidation. In the love column: literature, irony, humor, the individual, and the defense of free expression... To re-state the premise of the argument again: the theocratic head of a foreign despotism offers money in his own name in order to suborn the murder of a civilian citizen of another country, for the offense of writing a work of fiction. No more root-and-branch challenge to the values of the Enlightenment (on the bicentennial of the fall of the Bastille) or to the First Amendment to the Constitution, could be imagined.</i><br/><br/><i>I had become accustomed to the pseudo-Left new style, whereby if your opponent thought he had identified your lowest possible motive, he was quite certain that he had isolated the only real one.

Her thesis is that the problem is sociological and aesthetic: in the absence of new data sources, we form cliques and regroup around incompatible, unempirical beauty intuitions. <br/><blockquote><i>it leads me to conjecture that the laws of nature are beautiful because physicists constantly tell each other those laws are beautiful.</blockquote></i><blockquote><i>experimentalists working with a detector developed to catch neutrinos reported on the first “interesting bounds on galactic cold dark matter and on light bosons emitted from the sun.” In plain English, “interesting bounds” means they didn’t find anything. Various other neutrino experiments at the time also obtained interesting bounds.</blockquote></i><br/>Her prescription is that we should stop limiting the field so heavily with naturalness or geometric naturalness or symmetry or unification or  anti-fine-tuning intuitions, which collectively she (following her field) calls ""beauty"". Since Physical beauty is quite distinct from natural-language ""beauty"", I think it'd be better if we left those five components under a different name.<br/><br/>Filled with interviews with some of the cleverest, deepest physicists of our time (Arkani-Harked, Wilczek, Weinberg, Lisi, Polchinski) and the several bandwagons they lead, blind, in different directions. Hossenfelder herself is funny, self-critical, scrupulously clear: the kind of curmudgeonly, unbiddable empiricist we always need.<br/><blockquote><i>“You ask, why do people still work on it?” Nima [Arkani-Harked] continues. “It’s in fact very funny. As I said, the best people had a pretty good idea what was going on—they were not sitting on their hands waiting for gluinos to pour out of the LHC. They also had a pretty level reaction to the data.”<br/><br/>But not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles. I’m not sure which I find worse, scientists who believe in arguments from beauty or scientists who deliberately mislead the public about prospects of costly experiments.<br/><br/>Nima continues: “The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life? Other than you yourself, of course.”<br/><br/>He isn’t speaking about me, but he might as well be, I think. Maybe I’m just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I’m disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with—blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method.<br/><br/>On the plane back to Frankfurt, bereft of Nima’s enthusiasm, I understand why he has become so influential. In contrast to me, he believes in what he does.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>That sweet bitterness is telling; Hossenfelder is the broke-down hard-boiled P.I. of particle physics.<br/><i><blockquote><br/>I shouldn’t be here, I should be at my desk, reading a paper, drafting a proposal, or at least writing a referee report. I shouldn’t psychoanalyze a community that neither needs nor wants therapy.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/><i><blockquote>I hook onto the Wi-Fi. After a week of nonstop travel, my inbox is filling with urgent messages. There are two unhappy editors complaining about overdue reports, a journalist asking for comment, a student asking for advice. A form to be signed, a meeting to be rescheduled, two phone calls to be made, a conference invitation that needs to be politely declined. A collaborator returns the draft of a grant proposal for revision.<br/><br/>I remember reading biographies of last century’s heroes, picturing theoretical physicists as people puffing pipes in leather armchairs while thinking big thoughts.</i></blockquote><br/>Her exposition is impressively clear, covering the whole standard model (and quantum mechanics, and much of modern cosmology) in plain diagrams and terse language. (Though, as usual with pop science, one can't really spot where the simplifications are misleading unless you're already an insider.)<br/><br/>The heavies are in general very open and undogmatic about the state of things (they can afford to be, what with tenure). Weinberg:<br/><blockquote><i>    I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying…<br/><br/>    I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.<br/></i></blockquote><br/>(There's a nice bit where Weinberg hears a new philosophical/historical theory of physics - that the revolutions always involve overthrowing an old aesthetic principle - and is immediately nerd-sniped and charmed by it. Also Wilczek:<br/><i><blockquote>According to McAllister, scientists don’t throw out everything during a revolution; they only throw out their conception of beauty. So whenever there is a revolution in science, they have to come up with a new idea of beauty. He lists some examples for this: the steady state universe, quantum mechanics, et cetera.<br/>“If that was true,” I go on, “it would tell me that getting stuck on the ideas of beauty from the past is exactly the wrong thing to do.”<br/>“Yes, right,” Frank says. “It’s normally a good guiding principle. But occasionally you have to introduce something new. In each of these examples you find, though, that the new ideas are beautiful too.”<br/>“But people only found that new beauty after data forced them to look at it,” I point out. “And I’m worried we might not be able to get there. Because we are stuck on this old idea of beauty that we use to construct theories and to propose experiments to test them.”<br/>“You might be right.""</i></blockquote>)<br/><br/>She even seeks out the ugliest theories, like Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net condensation, trying to find her own aesthetic limits:<br/><blockquote><i>I am skeptical, but I tell myself to be more open-minded. Isn’t this what I was looking for, something off the well-trodden path? Is it really any weirder to believe everything is made of qubits than of strings or loops or some 248-dimensional representation of a giant Lie algebra?<br/><br/>How patently absurd it must appear to someone who last had contact with physics in eleventh grade that people get paid for ideas like that. But then, I think, people also get paid for throwing balls through hoops.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>This bit understates a real problem (it implies we don't use Solomonoff induction out of pique rather than incomputability):<br/><blockquote><i>A way to objectively quantify simplicity is by computational complexity, which is measured by the length of a computer program that executes a calculation. Computational complexity is in principle quantifiable for any theory that can be converted into computer code, which includes the type of theories we currently use in physics. We are not computers, however, and computational complexity is therefore not a measure we actually use. The human idea of simplicity is instead very much based on ease of applicability, which is closely tied to our ability to grasp an idea, hold it in mind, and push it around until a paper falls out.</blockquote></i><br/><br/>Better than <i>The Trouble with Physics</i> which I also liked (though he was narrower and less balanced about string theory). Maybe 5/5 if I reread it. <a href=""https://backreaction.blogspot.com/"">Her blog is extremely worthwhile</a> and more technical and thus less untrue.<br/><br/><br><br/>* OK, ""high-energy particle physicists and also Grand Unified Theorists of whatever stripe including some cosmologists"".

When I saw Hester, I suddenly realised that all I had thought about the finite, ponderable, numerable nature of Parkinsonism was nonsense. I suddenly realized, at this moment, that Parkisonism could in no sense be seen as a thing which increased or decreased by finite increments... that it was anumerical; that from its first, infinitesimal intimation it could proceed by an infinite multitude of infinitesimal increments to an infinite, and then more infinite, and still more infinite, degree of severity...

Call it <i>anaesthetic conceptualism</i>. It is also a nice illustrated catalogue of some recent objects that have managed to piss various people off. 150 years ago, we direly needed people to make art larger, to stand against the Academic approach of Nice Hard Mimesis Only. The problem is that since the 50s many artists replaced that shallow spectacle of mere mimetic skill with the even shallower spectacle of empty originality and flashy cynicism. This book has <i>such</i> a patronising presentation; it could have been named ""How to explain conceptualism to your five year-old"". (I guess that could have been an intentional irony, but to me it just told me what she thinks of anyone sceptical of the trend. But some kudos for being clear, since this makes the hollowness of her points blatant.)<br/><br/>I have to applaud her; unlike the rest of her curator peers, she has at least <i>attempted</i> to justify a gigantically expensive, creativity-draining, status-hogging practice with close readings. I should also thank her for tacitly admitting that the only hermeneutics that can justify anaesthetic conceptualism is a small-minded and super-conservative intentionalism (i.e. 'what matters about the work is what the artist meant').* ""It doesn't really matter how the object looks; what really matters is how deep the creator was and how much history you can project on it."" But this philosophy of art is convincing to no-one not already invested in the great tedious playground. I dislike most of this art, and this way of talking about it, because I want to love art.***<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a useful catalogue of the kind of low-skill pieces that have only recently been possible and that you need to know about to move in certain presumably unbearable circles.<br/><br/><br><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>* Though the so-called <a href=""http://faculty.smu.edu/nschwart/seminar/fallacy.htm"">intentional fallacy</a> is not actually a fallacy** - it does not make sense to say that someone is <i>literally mistaken</i> to think that the creator's view of an artwork is the only relevant one, since aesthetic interpretation doesn't admit of literal error - instead it's just an incredibly limited and superstitious philosophy - along the same lines as deontology in ethics. It makes art a small and mostly ancient thing, while aesthetic experience could instead rise to each of the potential billions of minds that come to it, and it always takes place in the present, with entirely novel meanings generated, far beyond the ken of any creator.<br/><br/><br/>** I'm aware that 'fallacy' has found usage outside of its original meaning, 'a failure in logical reasoning'. But the new usage, committed for instance by Beardsley, is something shitey like 'a horrible belief I don't like boo'. I'm generally torn between a descriptive and a prescriptive philosophy of vocabulary, but in this case the bullying and sloppy-mindedness of the new usage makes me deny it outright. Some words are too important to give up. (Mostly epistemology tbf.)<br/><br/>*** This is an unforgivably poncey thing to say, not least because I don't think I really mean it. If crap artists had not usurped a good portion of all the species' attention and reverence, I don't think I'd care what modern art was like. But as it is they are cheaters - even the great ones. They cheat themselves into immortality and perceived profundity via the handy expedient of prettiness and vagueness or ugliness and vagueness.

She makes up for the long-missing romanticism single-handed! The two-hundred year eclipse of the Bayesian method was much longer than that suffered by even the irrationally-maligned <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Continental_drift#/Rejection_of_Wegener.27s_theory.2C_1910s.E2.80.931950s"">continental drift</a> theory (50 years). And this neglect and opprobrium was suffered by a paradigm now accepted everywhere as powerful and useful in literally all kinds of research. <br/><br/>She wins us over, particularly with her chapter on the secretive, truculent, omnicompetent genius John Tukey, who used Bayesian methods for elections 40 years before <i><a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/"">Fivethirtyeight</a></i>, with comparable success. But her prose is borderline, with lots of clear but dim-bulb sentences. <br/><br/>She has one infuriating mannerism: she constantly refers to Bayes' rule, Bayesian logical foundations after Bayes, Bayesian inference, <i>and</i> personalist Bayesian epistemology by the single terrible metonym ""Bayes"": <br/><blockquote><i>At its heart, Bayes runs counter to the deeply held conviction that science requires total objectivity and precision. Bayes is a measure of belief.<br/><br/>...even many nonstatisticians regarded Swinburne's lack of care and measurement as a black mark against Bayes itself.<br/><br/>...Bayes, on the other hand, seemed to produce results that corresponded more closely to sociologists' intuitions.<br/><br/>...Wagner took along the youngest and greenest of his three-man staff, Henry Richardson, who had earned a PhD in probability theory all of seven months earlier. He would be Bayes' point man at Palomares.</i></blockquote><br/>I suppose she did this to elide away jargon, but it both equivocates between very different entities, hides the complexity of the 'Bayesian' marquee, invites the idea that the frequentists were attacking a logically sound theorem, and produces a whole list of bizarre images, where we see the reclusive Reverend doing all these things: cracking Enigma and Tunny, finding H-Bombs lost at sea, calculating appropriate worker's comp amounts in the absence of reliable data, attributing <i>The Federalist Papers</i> to Hamilton, and blocking 99.9% of the spam email from reaching you (yes, you). <br/><br/>It is also even <i>more</i> unfair to Laplace than usual. (It was he who developed Bayesianism into the powerful applied framework it is, into more than a single gambler's theorem. Ok, so ""Laplace-Coxism"" is admittedly even less admissible as a term to which the wise and honest may repair.) <br/><br/>Grammatical twitching aside this was a fun introduction to an important thing.<br/><br/>She focusses on the soft, social side (and on applications vaguely summarised). There was a huge amount of factional bitching between these serious and cloistered men:<br/><blockquote><i>Attending his first Bayesian conference in 1976, Jim Berger was shocked to see half the room yelling at the other half. Everyone seemed to be good friends, but their priors were split between the personally subjective, like Savage's, and the objective, like Jeffrey's - with no definitive experiment to decide the issue.<br/>In a frustrated circle of blame, Persi Diaconis was shocked and angry when John Pratt used frequentist methods to analyze his wife's movie theater attendance data, because it was too much for the era's computers to handle. But one of the low moments of Diaconis' life occurred in a Berkeley coffee shop, where he was correcting proofs of an article of his and where Lindley blamed him for using frequency methods. ""And you're our leading Bayesian"", Lindley complained. Lindley, in turn, upset Mosteller by passing up a chance to conduct a big project using Bayes instead of frequency...<br/>Asked how to encourage Bayesian theory, Lindley answered tartly, ""Attend funerals"".</i></blockquote><br/>This human focus means she gives no treatment of <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cox's_theorem"">Cox's theorem</a>, certainly the most remarkable result in formal epistemology (and probability theory?), and one of the main things which rationally warrants the partisanship and excitement she displays for Bayesian thought throughout. (""<a href=""http://biasandbelief.pbworks.com/w/page/6537213/References%20on%20the%20Cox%20Proof"">Justified fundamentalism</a>"", as one great commentator puts it!) It proves that any attempt to use numbers to model belief must be Bayesian or logically equivalent to it. With other results, it raises Bayesianism to the only viable quantitative theory of rationality and of right learning, a behemoth of which Aristotelian logic is a mere special case. No doubt I'm unusual in finding this the most exciting bit.<br/><br/>She's to be applauded for digging out novel examples of Bayesian analysis which were classified or which avoided using the word: early actuarial work, Tukey's US election model, the pre-Three-Mile-Island federal report of reactor safety, and the entire field of operational research. But she is so concerned with emphasising the (genuine) long oppression of the paradigm that she under-emphasises the good reasons to resist Bayesian methods before 1980: they were simply computationally intractable before MCMC. (Which makes the sheer effort put in to shortcuts and approximation methods by ingenious people quite tragic; they just aren't needed anymore, thirty years later.) To her credit, she does mention the parallel dogmatism of the 60s Bayesians and the presumptive overenthusiasm of some people in the last 10 years. <br/><br/>(The great contemporary frequentist, Deborah Mayo, is able to subtitle her blog ""<a href=""https://errorstatistics.com/about-2/"">Frequentists in Exile</a>"" without being absurd - even though Stats 101 and ""Methods for [Social Science]"" courses are still everywhere dominated by canned Fisherian tests and frames. She means exile from the philosophy of statistics and probability.)<br/><br/>Insofar as you want to understand the large trends of the present and coming age, you need to know its economics; insofar as you must understand the new economics, you must understand AI; insofar as you must understand AI, you must understand machine learning and decision theory; insofar as you must understand machine learning, you must understand <a href=""http://blog.shakirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bayes_Deep.pdf"">both frequentism and Bayesianism</a>. Insofar as you do not yet have the mathematics to understand Bayesianism, nor the excitement of the promise of a final, real synthesis of objective with subjective, you must read this gentle prose work. Once you are excited by its vague promises, you can find progressively more rigorous people and will have actually have reason to stomach the formalism.<br/><br/>3/5, 4*/5 for those just beginning the march.<br/><br/><br/><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H2gE7COadso/V1LP1e71xYI/AAAAAAAACls/FoZwG_oIjEU_tR4rhYg6cuJ3jh-bCjYjgCLcB/s1600/b5c26f9b444a6805027e2f8cc18fd59d.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H2gE7COadso/V1LP1e71xYI/AAAAAAAACls/FoZwG_oIjEU_tR4rhYg6cuJ3jh-bCjYjgCLcB/s640/b5c26f9b444a6805027e2f8cc18fd59d.jpg"" /></a>(c) African Sonata (c.2000) by Vladimir Kush</div>",,,1,0

Herzog is a contrived and dour and absurd man, and yet charming and sincere. Here is him describing <i>one</i> 6 month block of his youth: <blockquote><i><br/>I ended up penniless and was pushed around from place to place for weeks until finally I was picked up on a country road by the Franklin family. The mother had six children between seventeen and twenty-seven, her husband had died and there was a ninety-three-year-old grandmother. I owe them so much, this wonderful, crazy family who put me up in an attic... Of course I needed to earn some money, so I started to work on a project that was part of a series of films for NASA. That I made films for NASA always appears on those five-line biographies, and even if it is somehow true, it is completely irrelevant. I did have access to certain restricted areas and was able to talk to many of the scientists, but just before I was about to start work on the film they ran a security check...<br/><br/>It was evident I was about to be expelled from the country... so I took a rusty old Volkswagen and went to New York during a very bitter winter. I lived in the car for some time, even though its floor as rusted right through and I had a cast on my leg at the time because I had broken it quite badly after jumping out of a window... at night, when it gets cold, say at 3 or 4 a.m., the homeless of New York - who live almost like Neanderthal men - come and gather together on some empty, utterly desolate street and stand over fires they have kindled in the metal rubbish bins without speaking a word. Eventually I just cut the whole cast off with a pair of poultry shears and fled across the border into<br/>Mexico.</i></blockquote><br/>His whole life is lived with this undemonstrative fervour.<br/><br/>The interviewer is completely uninspired: he just works his way stolidly through Herzog's back catalogue, with no insight into anything much (""<i>Precautions Against Fanatics was your first colour film, a bizarre comedy set at a racetrack where various individuals feel it necessary to protect the animals from local 'fanatics'. Any comments?</i>""); we are fortunate that Herzog is self-stimulating and full of himself. I'll just let him show you how good he is:<br/><i><blockquote><br/>I have never been one of those who cares about happiness. Happiness is a strange notion. I am just not made for it. It has never been a goal of mine; I do not think in those terms. It seems to be a goal<br/>in life for many people, but I have no goals in life. <br/><br/>I am someone who takes everything very literally... I am like a Bavarian bullfrog just squatting there, brooding. I have never been capable of discussing art with people. I just cannot cope with irony. The French love to play with their words and to master French is to be a master of irony. Technically, I am able to speak the language - I know the words and verbs - but will do so only when I am really forced to.<br/><br/>I was forbidden to use fireworks. I told the army major that it was essential for the film. 'You'll be arrested,' he said. 'Then arrest me,' I said, 'but know that I will not be unarmed tomorrow. And the first man who touches me will drop down dead with me.' The next day there were fifty policemen and soldiers standing watching me work, plus a few thousand people from the town who wanted to see the fireworks. Of course, I was not armed, but how were they to know? Nobody complained or said anything. So through all these incidents I learned very quickly that this was the very nature of filmmaking.</i></blockquote><br/>Everything he makes is worth your time (even <i>Dinotasia</i> is so bad it's good).",,,1,0

Given time, it certainly will kill you. But it’s the lies that make you want to kill yourself.'<br/><br/>    Shevek turned around to face him. 'But you can’t seriously talk of a government, here!'<br/><br/>    'Tomar’s Definition: ‘Government: the legal use of power to maintain and extend power.’ Replace ‘legal’ with ‘customary’... Shev, did you ever think that what the analogic mode calls ‘disease,’ social disaffection, discontent, alienation, that this might analogically also be called pain – what you meant when you talked about pain, suffering? And that, like pain, it serves a function in the organism?... I speak of spiritual suffering! Of people seeing their talent, their work, their lives wasted. Of good minds submitting to stupid ones. Of strength and courage strangled by envy, greed for power, fear of change. Change is freedom, change is life – is anything more basic to Odonian thought than that? But nothing changes any more! ... On Urras they have government by the minority. Here we have government by the majority. But it is government!' <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't think her Anarres economy would work even as well as it is depicted as doing, but she has at least thought about it (admits that there would need to be a centralised computer, admits all kinds of shortages). This is not polemic, then; it just doesn't manage her usual grace when dealing with huge dilemmas. A great book by anyone else. ",,,1,0

Hodder's job, which, remarkably, went undone over 200 years of scholarly debate, is to consider the possible explanations (e.g. ""Smith divides society into disjoint private and public spheres""; ""one of the two books is ironic""; ""he changed his mind""; ""he was a idjit"") through close exegesis and logical reconstruction, and somehow weigh them.<br/><br/>The conclusion is satisfying enough: <i>What is the Adam Smith Problem?: A debate on a problem; the debate was the problem</i>. Basically, a series of bad readers (from the German Historicists to Paul Samuelson) misread certain key terms and passages, imputed an anachronistic atheism and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes#Agent"">efficient-causation</a> empiricism to him, and then propagated a straw-man (""a <a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/article/226156/pdf"">shadow history</a>"") throughout the secondary literature and the tertiary sewer we call the media. (They also missed the timing and the explicit initial audience of <i>WoN</i>: the book is avowedly a polemic to affect British trade policy, and a highly successful one at that.)<br/><br/>Hodder writes with absolutely minimal jargon; this is as easily grasped as C18th political economy can be. One of my notes was that an institutionalised marker might penalise it for omitting jargon to the degree it does; after all, what's the point if just anyone can waltz in to constructive thought without using the gaudy tools made in desperation by knowledge pieceworkers?:<br/><blockquote><br/><i>Sympathy plays a far more foundational role in </i>WN<i> than has previously been noted by any scholar which I have encountered. If we return to the butcher, brewer and baker, example, where we address ourselves not to their benevolence but to their self-interest, all commentators seem to have overlooked the question of how we are to go about addressing ourselves to another's self-interest. The obvious and simple answer to this is Sympathy. We put ourselves in their place, we realise that they expect to be paid for their labour as we would expect to be paid for our own, and as a result we understand that the appropriate behaviour expected of us is to pay for their service. In the primitive society, where the hunter begins to trade his bows for food and starts down the long road towards commercial society, it must be Sympathy which alerts his fellow hunters that he wants something in return for the bows he produces. “Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want” requires that I can escape my own self-interest and understand what you want, and have at least a basic level of Sympathy for you otherwise I would not know what to offer you.<br/><br/>Sympathy must therefore apply to trade at a very foundational level, and that intimate Sympathy which fosters benevolence can take hold even in business relationships. All it requires is repeated dealings with the same person, and a character which is “well-disposed”. It is not said to be central to society - but this is entirely consistent with </i>TMS<i>, where Smith describes benevolence as “the ornament that embellishes” society, that which makes it happier rather than merely efficient.</i></blockquote><br/>I do wonder at the fact that someone with no historiographical background and only half an economics degree could make substantive corrections and suggestions at the very frontier of the field's knowledge of <i>a canonical figure</i>. In one way this is nice: reason is a universal solvent, and specific facts make up relatively little of total intellectual work! But in another way sad: the pompousness and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary-work"">boundary-work</a> of the non-formal academic fields is again shown to be needless, and narrowing.",,,1,0

Irreconcilable with this Jewish Marxist view is the Teutonic German idea that we are the bearers of the eternal legacy of our ancestors, and that accordingly our body belongs to the clan and the people.’<br/><br/>Chocolates spiked with methamphetamine were even put on the market. A good 14 milligrams of methamphetamine was included in each individual choc – almost five times the amount in a [prescription] pill.</i></blockquote><br/>Ohler argues that drugs have been overlooked as the (unsustainable) engine of the Nazi economic recovery, and of the alien intensity of the ideology, because people took Goebbels at his word about the Nazi drive for natural organic wellness and purity and so ignored this 'medicine' that millions of Germans were supplied by the state and IG.

Dancing with Steve Tyler, Run-DMC forgets that Muddy Waters’ sideman Willie Dixon had to sue Led Zeppelin to get proper credit for their use of his blues. “Walk This Way” is an unwanted reunion of 80s black street music with part of its rich heritage, as that heritage has been mined and mongrelized by Show Biz. If this is desegregation, then shopping malls hold treasure...<br/><br/>It’s a new and carnivorous kind of mimesis that makes weary old ‘self-reference’ actually kind of interesting, because it enlarges Self from the standard rock-subjective–a bundle of hormone-drenched emotions attached to a larynx and pelvis–to a 'big ole head,’ a kind of visual street-corner, a monadic Everybrother, an angry, jaded eye on a centerless pop-culture country full of marginalized subnations that are themselves postmodern, looped, self-referential, self-obsessed, voyeuristic, passive, slack-jawed, debased, and sources of such prodigious signal-and-data bombardment that they seem to move faster than the angry eye itself can see…</i></blockquote><br/>I had been putting off reading this because of the title: I didn't know about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-PxCWwu5kQ"">Schooly D</a>'s track, so I read the verb in a gross academic voice (""in which we give rappers true signification"") rather than the adjectival sense they actually meant (""rappers who signify"").<br/>Costello's bits are ok, DJ ""MC"" to MC ""DFW"". Wallace is harder than Costello - noting that MCs really are just yuppies, that Chuck D's claims to not be glorifying violence are absurd, that part of the fascination of hard rap is the snuff-spiral of trying to be nastier and nastier than previous hard rappers, which is just the commercial impulse of Alice Cooper minus musicianship. But this is also a winning early bet: that rap is poetry, that it was and would be ""the decade's most important and influential pop movement"":<br/><blockquote><br/><i>Our opinion, then, from a distance: not only is serious rap poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great U.S. Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we’ve been encouraged sadly to write off, it’s quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. ‘Real’ (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocal, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn’t get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers..</i><br/></blockquote><br/>Your enjoyment will depend on you giving a crap about the sheer horror of rap's initial context and being able to tolerate intentionally torturous pomo prose and juxtapositions (e.g. <i>I Dream of Jeannie</i> vs race riots).

49423,Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling With D.H. Lawrence,Geoff Dyer,"Dyer, Geoff",,"=""0865475407""","=""9780865475403""",4,4.02,North Point Press,Paperback,256,1999,1997,,2018/06/27,,,read,"A book about an unwritten book about a writer I don't like much. And it's amazing! Not a study of Lawrence, a study of trying to write when you lack an iron will. So also a study of all work, so a study of the hard generation of value, and so, despite appearances, a study of what matters.<br/><br/>The prose is circuitous, cantatory, shaggy-dog, but never dull:<br/><blockquote><i> Oxford! Now if there is one place on earth where you cannot, where it is physically impossible to write a book about Lawrence it is here, in Oxford. You could write a book about plenty of writers in Oxford: Hardy, or Joyce even — people are probably doing just that, even now, dozens of them — but not Lawrence. If there is one person you cannot write a book about here, in Oxford, it is Lawrence. So I have made doubly sure that there is no chance of my finishing my study of Lawrence: he is the one person you cannot write about here, in Oxford; and Oxford is the one place where you cannot write about Lawrence.<br/><br/> When I say you can’t possibly write a book about Lawrence in Oxford that is not to be taken too literally. At this moment, within a few miles of my flat, dozens of people are probably writing books about Lawrence. That tapping I can hear through my open window is probably someone writing a book or a thesis or preparing a lecture, or, at the very least, doing an essay on D. H. Lawrence. It can be done. It can be done — but it can’t be done, it shouldn’t be done. You can’t write a half-decent book about Lawrence in Oxford, can’t write any kind of book about Lawrence without betraying him totally. By doing so you immediately disqualify yourself, render yourself ineligible. It is like spitting on his grave.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>For a while I amused myself by seeing how many consecutive sentences used the same phrase, in a running stitch motif. He is playing a character, but like Rob Brydon does: only slightly heightened.<br/><br/>One long stream of scenes, unthemed, unbracketed. He is the critic I would have hoped to be: sceptical of the novel, sceptical of the spiritual pretensions of artists, sceptical of children, sceptical of travel and sceptical of home, sceptical of self. He is free to admit his boredom and his joy, unlike the academic critics he often erupts against. Here is the key passage (not that you can trust him to cleave to it twenty years or minutes on):<br/><blockquote><i>Hearing that I was ‘working on Lawrence’, an acquaintance lent me a book he thought I might find interesting: A </i>Longman Critical Reader<i> on Lawrence, edited by Peter Widdowson. I glanced at the contents page: old Eagleton was there, of course, together with some other state-of-the-fart theorists: Lydia Blanchard on ‘Lawrence, Foucault and the Language of Sexuality’ (in the section on ‘Gender, Sexuality, Feminism’), Daniel J. Schneider on ‘Alternatives to Logocentrism in D. H. Lawrence’ (in the section featuring ‘Post-Structuralist Turns’). I could feel myself getting angry and then I flicked through the introductory essay on ‘Radical Indeterminacy: a post-modern Lawrence’ and became angrier still. How could it have happened? How could these people with no feeling for literature have ended up teaching it, writing about it? I should have stopped there, should have avoided looking at any more, but I didn’t because telling myself to stop always has the effect of urging me on. Instead, I kept looking at this group of wankers huddled in a circle, backs turned to the world so that no one would see them pulling each other off. Oh, it was too much, it was too stupid. I threw the book across the room and then I tried to tear it up but it was too resilient. By now I was blazing mad...<br/><br/> I burned it in self-defence. It was the book or me - writing like that kills everything it touches. That is the hallmark of academic criticism: it kills everything it touches. Walk around a university campus and there is an almost palpable smell of death about the place because hundreds of academics are busy killing everything they touch. I recently met an academic who said that he taught German literature. I was aghast: to think, this man who had been in universities all his life was teaching Rilke. </i>Rilke<i>! Oh, it was too much to bear. You don’t teach Rilke, I wanted to say, you kill Rilke! You turn him to dust and then you go off to conferences where dozens of other academic-morticians gather with the express intention of killing Rilke and turning him to dust. Then, as part of the cover-up, the conference papers are published, the dust is embalmed and before you know it literature is a vast graveyard of dust, a dustyard of graves. I was beside myself with indignation. I wanted to maim and harm this polite, well-meaning academic who, for all I knew, was a brilliant teacher who had turned on generations of students to the </i>Duino Elegies<i>. Still, I thought to myself the following morning when I had calmed down, the general point stands: how can you know anything about literature if all you’ve done is read books? <br/><br/> Now, criticism is an integral part of the literary tradition and academics can sometimes write excellent works of criticism but these are exceptions - the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of books by academics, especially books like that </i>Longman Reader<i> are a crime against literature. </i></blockquote><br/><br/>The final passage hits you over the head with what you have certainly already worked out, but it is still very powerful. Dyer is inspiring, pure nevertheless:<br/><blockquote><i>One way or another we all have to write our studies of D. H. Lawrence. Even if they will never be published, even if we will never complete them, even if all we are left with after years and years of effort is an unfinished, unfinishable record of how we failed to live up to our own earlier ambitions, still we all have to try to make some progress with our books about D. H. Lawrence. The world over, from Taos to Taormina, from the places we have visited to countries we will never set foot in, the best we can do is to try to make some progress with our studies of D. H. Lawrence.</i></blockquote><br/>",,,1,0

Res ipsa loquitur:<br/><br/><blockquote><i>Whenever peace — conceived as the avoidance of war — has been the primary objective of a power or a group of powers, the international system has been at the mercy of the most ruthless member of the international community.

He respects Kissinger's single-mindedness and intellectual clout, while giving us plenty of his egotism and blandly evil wonkishness:<br/><blockquote><i><br/>Here was an example of what would become a pattern in Kissinger’s diplomacy: his attempt to mediate a dispute by finding a semantic formulation to finesse differences. In this case it was devising a phrase that linked the bombing halt to the negotiations, without sounding like a condition. Later, at the end of the war, he would search for ambiguous phrases about the demilitarized zone and South Vietnamese sovereignty that could be read differently in Hanoi and Saigon. Sometimes these word games paid off. But usually they opened Kissinger up to accusations that he had left important disagreements unresolved by talking out of both sides of his mouth.<br/><br/>[during the 1970 election, R v N ] At the convention, the Rockefeller forces, with little to lose, sent Kissinger to talk to the Iowa delegation. “It was so novel to me,” he told a reporter at the time. “I’d never met working politicians before. I didn’t attempt to talk their language. I just talked what I knew.” The Iowa delegation voted overwhelmingly for Nixon.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Isaacson soft-pedals the mass chaos and death Kissinger gave rise to.

We face four types of dislocating technologies: Genetics, Robotics, Infotech and Nanotech. <br/><br/>Garreau gives loads of stage time to two dogmatic cranks from each side: Kurzweil (booster technocrat), and Fukuyama (neocon fearmonger) as well as an unclassifiable polymath, Jaron Lanier. But this is sadly just the way <a href=""//www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGArqoF0TpQ"">science journalism is done</a>, and Garreau is later courageous in half-endorsing the transcendent transhuman rationale of beautiful bioprogressive Bostrom. Unfortunately his prose is Gladwellian, full of glib pop references and leaden line-break punch-lines. Still a balanced intro to the scenarios and figureheads. <br/><br/>You really should read something on the ethics of these technologies: I recommend <a href=""https://www.hedweb.com/hedab.htm"">Pearce</a>, <a href=""https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/values.html"">Bostrom</a>,  or <a href=""https://www.singularityweblog.com/anders-sandberg-on-singularity-1-on-1-we-are-all-amazingly-stupid-but-we-can-get-better/"">Sandberg</a>.",,,1,0

'Killing an Elephant' is, surprisingly, the most powerful animal rights essay I've read in years.<br/><br/>I think he'd struggle to get his essay on Dali published these days, maybe not even in the Spectator: we aren't able to think of art in these moral terms any more:<br/><br/><blockquote><i><br/>        [Dali's autobiography] is a book that stinks. If it were possible for a book to give a physical stink off its pages, this one would — a thought that might please Dali, who before wooing his future wife for the first time rubbed himself all over with an ointment made of goat's dung boiled up in fish glue. But against this has to be set the fact that Dali is a draughtsman of very exceptional gifts. He is also, to judge by the minuteness and the sureness of his drawings, a very hard worker. He is an exhibitionist and a careerist, but he is not a fraud. He has fifty times more talent than most of the people who would denounce his morals and jeer at his paintings. And these two sets of facts, taken together, raise a question which for lack of any basis of agreement seldom gets a real discussion.<br/>        <br/>The point is that you have here a direct, unmistakable assault on sanity and decency; and even — since some of Dali's pictures would tend to poison the imagination like a pornographic postcard — on life itself. What Dali has done and what he has imagined is debatable, but in his outlook, his character, the bedrock decency of a human being does not exist. He is as anti-social as a flea. Clearly, such people are undesirable, and a society in which they can flourish has something wrong with it.<br/><br/>        Now, if you showed this book, with its illustrations, to Lord Elton, to Mr. Alfred Noyes, to The Times leader writers who exult over the ‘eclipse of the highbrow’ — in fact, to any ‘sensible’ art-hating English person — it is easy to imagine what kind of response you would get. They would flatly refuse to see any merit in Dali whatever. Such people are not only unable to admit that what is morally degraded can be жsthetically right, but their real demand of every artist is that he shall pat them on the back and tell them that thought is unnecessary. And they can be especially dangerous at a time like the present, when the Ministry of Information and the British Council put power into their hands. For their impulse is not only to crush every new talent as it appears, but to castrate the past as well. Witness the renewed highbrow-baiting that is now going on in this country and America, with its outcry not only against Joyce, Proust and Lawrence, but even against T. S. Eliot.<br/><br/>        But if you talk to the kind of person who can see Dali's merits, the response that you get is not as a rule very much better. If you say that Dali, though a brilliant draughtsman, is a dirty little scoundrel, you are looked upon as a savage. If you say that you don't like rotting corpses, and that people who do like rotting corpses are mentally diseased, it is assumed that you lack the жsthetic sense. Since ‘Mannequin rotting in a taxicab’ is a good composition. And between these two fallacies there is no middle position, but we seldom hear much about it. On the one side Kulturbolschevismus: on the other (though the phrase itself is out of fashion) ‘Art for Art's sake.’ Obscenity is a very difficult question to discuss honestly. People are too frightened either of seeming to be shocked or of seeming not to be shocked, to be able to define the relationship between art and morals.<br/><br/>        suppose that you have nothing in you except your egoism and a dexterity that goes no higher than the elbow; suppose that your real gift is for a detailed, academic, representational style of drawing, your real métier to be an illustrator of scientific textbooks. How then do you become Napoleon? There is always one escape: into wickedness. Always do the thing that will shock and wound people. At five, throw a little boy off a bridge, strike an old doctor across the face with a whip and break his spectacles — or, at any rate, dream about doing such things. Twenty years later, gouge the eyes out of dead donkeys with a pair of scissors. Along those lines you can always feel yourself original. And after all, it pays! ... If you threw dead donkeys at people, they threw money back. <br/>    </blockquote></i>",,,2,0

The prose is just a voiceover: short sentences, newline punchlines, chatty laddish bluster. You wouldn't want to spend time with young Bourdain; too edgy, too miserable, too addled. At no point does he disown his wild years, but this is written as a different, charming, distant man. I suppose this made him a star because honesty and filth are rare in high cuisine, or in the received notion of high cuisine. He refers to himself as a ""cook"" throughout (or even ""cookie""), endearingly. <br/><br/>Anyone else playing at being a junkie cuisinier, sexual tyrannosaurus, smash-hit author, primetime travel host, and, most recently, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmgRXUmYncE"">jiujitsu japer</a> would surely be risible.

Literary, clear, almost bipartisan. As a former socialist finance minister, he has a healthy blend of actual economic knowledge and smouldering will to improve an irrational status quo. (He uses ""irrational"" <i>far</i> more than the usual pejoratives: ""greedy"" or ""exploitative"" or ""neoliberal"".) <br/><br/>He makes lots of literary allusions and shares personal tales of fascist Greece. These make the deadly dull business of postwar European monetary politics readable. He talks about the duty of surplus nations to stabilize the world system, which is true and good but unworkable. He has a remarkable admiration for American institutions and figures - not just the New Dealers, but also, in a way, for Volcker and Geithner - while also pointing out astutely. Full marks for tone, basically. <br/><br/>    A good writer, with only a couple of wrongfooted sentences. Potted history of post-war international macroeconomics. <br/><br/>    His policies do not much resemble socialism: all the same neoliberal institutions exist in Varoufakisland. He'd just use them to help the vulnerable. <br/><br/>    America (Harry White, Volcker) had a chance to stabilise the world, but instead grabbed national interest at the expense of others. Then - according to Varoufakis - they grabbed hegemony at the expense of their own, which is even more depressing.<br/><br/>His current-account focussed theory is a bit narrow. There is already a eurozone surplus recycling mechanism, for instance. His 2015 Greek finance policies continue to look better than the current blind bailout plus permadeflation solution: Greece should have defaulted. His (and Holland's) recommendations are very sensible.<br/><br/>Despite being short, it is really repetitive; I skimmed chapters 4-6 heavily.

Feynman is different from other first-rank minds: he values clarity and humour above all. He's a slightly hazardous role model though: his sheer speed, creativity, and high standards, which justify his arrogance and deviance, <i>cannot</i> be emulated by ordinary people; his mantra - ""<a href=""https://stepsandleaps.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/feynmans-breakthrough-disregard-others/"">disregard [what other people are doing]</a>"" - is similarly high-risk; and his pickup-artistry after Arline died is at least icky. But the big <i>accessible</i> hazard is his thrilling science-supremacism. Gleick:<br/><blockquote><br/>Feynman told them [his self-spun legend]:<br/>   how he became known in Far Rockaway as the boy who fixed radios by thinking; how he asked a Princeton librarian for the map of the cat; how his father taught him to see through the tricks of circus mind readers; how he outwitted painters, mathematicians, philosophers, and psychiatrists.<br/></blockquote><br/>Feynman:<br/><blockquote><br/>    For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it. Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>His cheeky scientism will make unread teenagers insufferable at parties. More seriously, it could return our scientists to unreflective, uninspired positivism. But his anti-authoritarianism, his anti-pretension, his honest and sweeping scepticism, his existential peace, more than compensate. Filtering out the above, his life is an enormously fruitful applied epistemology.<br/><br/>It is shocking, to anyone who knows the modern salami-slicing academic world, to hear how many breakthroughs he didn't publish, just out of high standards:<br/><blockquote><br/>    A great physicist who accumulated knowledge without taking the trouble to publish could be a genuine danger to his colleagues. At best it was unnerving to learn that one’s potentially career-advancing discovery had been, to Feynman, below the threshold of publishability. At worst it undermined one’s confidence in the landscape of the known and not known.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>And how he resisted <a href=""http://johnquiggin.com/2009/05/27/a-taxonomy-of-delusion/"">emeritus</a> <a href=""https://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2556"">disease</a> to the end. Hawking: “We may now be near the end of the search for the ultimate laws of nature,”. Feynman:<br/><blockquote><br/>    I’ve had a lifetime of that. I’ve had a lifetime of people who believe that the answer is just around the corner. But again and again it’s been a failure. Eddington, who thought that with the theory of electrons and quantum mechanics everything was going to be simple... Einstein, who thought that he had a unified theory just around the corner but didn’t know anything about nuclei and was unable of course to guess it... People think they’re very close to the answer, but I don’t think so...<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Whether or not nature has an ultimate, simple, unified, beautiful form is an open question, and I don’t want to say either way.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Feynman's ideas are still completely modern. He'll be modern for a long time to come, too: as the main theorist of the path integral formulation of QM, the first theorist of nanotechnology and quantum computing, as storyteller, as a complete master of applied epistemology for humans.",,,1,0

Galloway's a marketing professor / entrepreneur, and so this is a weird mix of polemical and fawning. (OK, I should've guessed its genre from the thoughtless use of institutional ""DNA"" in the subtitle.) There's basically no politics in this: it's a primer for worried and pious businessmen more than consumers or citizens or engineers. It also uses ""relevant"" unironically as a quantity of ultimate importance (""<i>Google had a market cap that topped $200 billion. But the Times was enormously relevant</i>"".<br/><br/>I enjoyed this <br/><blockquote><br/>  [education], the cartel that masquerades as a social good but is really a caste system<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>and this (though his counterproposal wouldn't change much either):<br/><blockquote><br/>It is conventional wisdom that Steve Jobs put 'a dent in the universe.' No, he didn’t. Steve Jobs, in my view, spat on the universe. People who get up every morning, get their kids dressed, get them to school, and have an irrational passion for their kids’ well-being, dent the universe. The world needs more homes with engaged parents, not a better fucking phone.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>He presents himself as a critical outsider, and a moralist, but in between his rants he is scarcely less fawning about a set of overpriced electronics: <br/><blockquote><br/>In those ten years, Apple introduced one earth-shaking, 100-billion-dollar, categorycreating new product or service after another. The iPod, iTunes/Apple Store, iPhone, and iPad ... there has never been anything like it.<br/><br/>The iPod's introduction, in late 2001 after the twin shocks of the bursting of the dot-com bubble and 9/11, played the same role as the Beatles' appearance on Ed Sullivan just months after the Kennedy assassination: it was a bright light in the darkness that signaled hope and optimism. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>And often his barbs are just glib. His full argument against Bezos' support for basic income:<br/><blockquote><br/>What's clear is that we need business leaders who envision and enact a future with more jobs — not billionaires who want the government to fund, with taxes they avoid, social programs for people to sit on their couches and watch Netflix all day. Jeff, show some real fucking vision.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>Besides the hollowness, there are dozens of minor errors or infelicities:<br/><blockquote><br/>  Luxury is not an externality; it's in our genes. It combines our instinctive need to transcend the human condition and feel closer to divine perfection, with our desire to be more attractive to potential mates. <br/></blockquote><br/>(That's not what ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality"">externality</a>"" means.)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Because media companies only get a mildly insane valuation, and the Four are addicted to iconospheric valuations — hundreds of billions. <br/></blockquote><br/>(""Ionospheric"" rather)<br/><blockquote><br/>   When Nietzsche proclaimed God is dead, it wasn't a victory cry but a lamentation on the loss of moral compass.<br/></blockquote><br/>(1) ""compass"" makes for a really poor adjective, please don't do that; 2) that's a ludicrous reading, though less silly than the usual macho triumph one.)<br/><blockquote><br/>  The effectiveness of prayer, the additional scrutiny determined, remains a matter of opinion.<br/></blockquote><br/>(Sure, for a pejorative sense of ""opinion"".)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  [big data] signals the end of sampling and statistics - now you can just track the shopping pattern of every customer in every one of your stores<br/></blockquote><br/>(1) this is the ""n=all"" dogma and, though very popular among people with bridges to sell, it is just not true - because no one ever has the full data set, because even if they did have a synchronous snapshot then we'd still need predictions to future data; 2) even if that were so, it certainly would not be the end of statistics, since sampling theory is a tiny subset of statistics.)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The genius of Google was there from day one, in September 1998, when Stanford students Sergey Brin and Larry Page designed a new web tool, called a search engine, that could skip across the internet in search of keywords.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Search was <i>not</i> a new tool: Knowbot (1989), Archie (1990), Wandex (1993), Mosaic...<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  We saw the world differently and approached it from entirely different angles. My whole life has been a quest to gain relevance and fear of never achieving it, whereas Arthur's biggest fear (I believe) was losing it.<br/></blockquote><br/>In what way are those two angles entirely different?<br/><br/>This was unintentionally revealing:<br/><blockquote><br/>  Attractive things work better... When you wash and wax a car, it drives better, doesn't it? Or at least feels like it does.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>And this:<br/><blockquote><br/>  Malcolm Gladwell, the Jesus of business books...<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>There's the rub, I think. This is a business book, and since I haven't read any ""business books"" in years I was unprepared for its fawning, glibness, and applause lights. Galloway is no doubt in the right lane; it was I that drifted.<br/><br/>Skip it. The subject - this tiny set of untouchable, market-breaking corporations with large fanbases and financial carte blanche - is important to understand, too important to leave it to Galloway.
