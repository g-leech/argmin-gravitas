    "review": "<i>In one sentence</i>: Stunning expansion of science fiction to very distant possible worlds and emotionally unusual near ones. Borgesian scifi.<br>\r\n\r\n<i>To be read when</i>: annoyed by the sterility of median scifi and the folksy ignorance of median litfic; if disparaging scifi; if you think Black Mirror is deep...<br>\r\n\r\nAstoundingly good. The stories are extremely miscellaneous (hard Sumerian mythology, linguistic-physics ethnography, singularitarian tragedy, <i>Arabian Nights</i> fantasy, mechanical-philosophy tragedy, misotheistic tragedy), but bear one heavy theme - that rationalism, materialism is not the enemy of humanism, but is much more able to accommodate us, our highest values, than is romantic supernaturalism.\r\n\r\nSo he's an artistically successful Yudkowsky; Chiang's own presumable nerdiness disappears behind his powerful austere prose, even when characters are expounding the principle of least action or the details of ancient masonry.\r\n\r\n'Story of Your Life' is so much more interesting, emotionally and scientifically, than the <i>Arrival</i> film it was made into. It is about how alien and repugnant <i>amor fati</i> is, and maybe <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/Story-Of-Your-Life\">variational physics</a>.\r\n\r\n'Tower of Babylon' is rousing minutiae. 'Hell is the Absence of God' takes the tired, speculative, stupid themes of the Abrahamic conversation - faith, will, love, persistence, atheism - and wrings out a new chord from them. Ah! <br><br>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>\r\n<a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Galef type</a>:<br>\r\n    Theory 1 - models of how a phenomenon works, &<br>\r\n    Theory 3 - pointing out a problem, &<br>\r\n    Values 2 - thought experiments to reflect on how you feel about something , &<br>\r\n    Style 3 - tickles your aesthetic sense in a way that obliquely makes you a more generative thinker .\r\n</li>",

Motifs are well-known: the hostile wind heard from the cold attic; the diminishing of strength; the <a href=\"http://technicoloresque.tumblr.com/post/50677727164/if-my-darling-by-philip-larkin\">fall of desire</a> without a fall in the desire to desire; the conviction that age is not running out of time, but running out of self. These are not moans: he loves jazz and booze and other things that make death recede. He’s vulgar, and wields it, but never as punchline; <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/178054\">what starts</a> “<i>Groping back to bed after a piss” will end with the universe</i> :\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>    The hardness and the brightness and plain\r\n    far-reaching singleness of that wide stare\r\n    Is a reminder of the strength and the pain\r\n    Of being young; that it can’t come again,\r\n    But is for others undiminished somewhere. \r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere’s too much in this volume. I mean that as criticism of its editor, not as expression of Larkin’s o’erflowing sublimity. But that too, actually: “Sad Steps”, “<a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/178058\">Aubade</a>”, “For Sidney Bechet”, \"No Road\", and “Continuing to Live” are among my favourites.\r\n\r\nBy ’72 his bitterness and fear had overcome his kindness, and he dried up, leaving doggerel for mates and nasty biz like “The Old Fools” or “<a href=\"http://artinfiction.wordpress.com/2012/03/21/philip-larkin-the-card-players/\">The Card Players</a>”. And yet even after three years of this came “Aubade”. \r\n\r\nI avoided the juvenilia, perhaps even out of superstitious respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li>    <a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Galef type</a>: <br>\r\n\r\nData 3 - that highlight patterns in the world , &<br>\r\n\r\n    Style 3 - tickles your aesthetic sense in a way that obliquely makes you a more interesting, generative thinker.\r\n\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",

    "review": "My favourite reporter; a great, compulsive, austere, compassionate writer. Better than Fermor when happy, better than Orwell when irate. I am always interested in what she has to say about literally anything: this edition covers her peacetime reporting, which is to say her poverty-and-rubble-reconstruction reporting: Great Depression Deep South; the arts in Communist Poland; the difficult path to democracy in Spain; Thatcher and the miners (...) She ranges over the whole sad half-century, bringing her maternal, judgmental, sardonic history to bear on what could otherwise have been ordinary journalism. Chastises communists and capitalists, liars, mercenaries and torturers of whatever justification. Never mentions her gender; she never let anyone stop her for any reason, let alone that.\r\n\r\nHer natural, common-sense compassion and fairness only cracks when it comes to Palestine; she contorts herself terribly in the face of shocking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1956%E2%80%9357_exodus_and_expulsions_from_Egypt\">Nasserian</a> anti-Semitism. It's <i>not</i> a whitewash; she talks to dozens of Palestinians in Jordan and Gaza, covers the Irgun and the bulldozers. But she is totally defensive about the Balfour Declaration and the Six Day War; is unusually eager to show up the many fibs of the Palestinian refugees (: confirmation bias); and excludes their self-determination alone among the nations of the earth:\r\n<blockquote><i>Arafat has had enough protection money from the oil Arabs to finance the education of two generations of young Palestinians, a chance to rise beyond the poverty of the camps into a good self-reliant life. Instead he has recruited two generations for training only in the use of guns and plastique, and insisted on a futile goal: Palestine for the Palestinians...\r\n\r\nIf I had been twenty years younger, I would have got myself to Vietnam somehow and joined the Vietcong, though handicapped by my height. Not much use for digging tunnels. Vietnam for the Vietnamese. Afghanistan for the Afghans. El Salvador for the Salvadorans. Nicaragua for the Nicaraguans. The inherent right of all peoples to self-determination. If they need civil war to determine how they shall be governed, that is their business and nobody else's.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nHow many deep inconsistencies are we allowed, before we stop being great? I don't know exactly, but more than one.\r\n",

    "review": "I feel able to say it at last: haiku is pathological, a genre absolutely limited to the engraving of flat single images. And single (or paired) verbal images of nature do nothing for me; it is relation and juxtaposition and story and reductios and original presentation that give images life. The haiku leaves almost no room for these. (This is not about length; the <i>senryu</i> retains wonderful possibilities, because they are animated by satire rather than po-faced nature-worship. Jokes can stand alone.)\r\n\r\nThis book cannot be blamed for being half haiku, because that mechanical law ruled Japanese poetry for thousands of years and this is first of all a historical selection. Lots more to see. \r\n\r\nCurrently I am only fond of the ancient gnostic hermits and the droll postwar internationalists (no multi-culturalists here). Many of the others emote at us too directly - the likes of \"<i>Oh how // I miss my wife // out here // on the border wall</i>\" - which brittle superficiality fails <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9357850-poetry-presents-the-thing-in-order-to-convey-the-feeling\">Wei Tai's test</a> and mine. In general their ancients have dated much better than ours, perhaps because they grokked ironic minimalism a thousand years before us.\r\n\r\nThe emperors and shoguns all write poetry, are still all required to profess about the land that they perch upon. Meiji:\r\n<div align=\"center\"><blockquote><i>In newspapers, all seethe doings of the world,which lead nowhere.Better never written!</i></blockquote></div>\r\nAmen. I liked Yamanoue Okura, Yakamochi, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokin_Wakash%C5%AB\">Kokinshū</a>, Ki Tsurayuki, Tsuboi Shigeji, Kaneko Mitsuhara, <a href=\"http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue12/takahashi.html\">Takahashi Mutsuo</a>. I absolutely do not have sufficient knowledge to stop there. Skip Bownas' enormous Preface too, you don't need it.\r\n\r\n<i>In one sentence</i>: 無.",

    "review": "Tense, effortless, funny, devastating. A single day among the melting upper-class, building up to a dinner party - but eliding the contempt we might feel with pathos and pain and humour. \r\n\r\nThe dialogue is consistently impressive. Victor is the most convincing philosopher character I've seen  - neurotic, analytic, too in his head to be harmful. Patrick's model of the world is slightly too sophisticated model for a five-year-old, but the scene in which he's introduced is the most convincing childlike prose:\r\n<blockquote><i>Patrick walked towards the well. In his hand he carried a grey plastic sword with a gold handle, and swished it at the pink flowers of the valerian plants that grew out of the terrace wall. When there was a snail on one of the fennel stems, he sliced his sword down the stalk and made it fall off. If he killed  a snail he had to stamp on it quickly and then run away, because it went all squishy like blowing your nose. Then he would go back and have a look at the broken brown shell stuck in the soft grey flesh, and would wish he hadn’t done it. It wasn’t fair to squash the snails after it rained because they came out to play, bathing in the pools under the dripping leaves and stretching out their horns. When he touched their horns they darted back and his hand darted back as well. For snails he was like a grown-up.</i></blockquote>\r\nAnd the venomous, purely perverse relationship of his parents produces gasping lines like\r\n<blockquote><i>At the beginning, there had been talk of using some of her money to start a home for alcoholics. In a sense they had succeeded.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nI stumble over David, the charming psychopath rampant. It is too hard to understand intentional evil, even when snobbery, tough love parenting and simple rage are proffered as explanations. I had a <i>petite mort</i> at the end. Really fantastic.\r\n\r\nIn one sitting.",

    "review": "A self-help book! in the form of a set of tricks and tools for good non-routine cognition. But it's utterly personable and scientifically charged, and a defence of naturalist semantics, mind, 'free' will, and philosophy itself, to boot. He's so much more subtle than he's given credit for; for instance, a large theme here is the central role of imagination in science and the other potent sorts of thought. I confess that I simply can't conceive of some of his positions (e.g. 'qualia' being illusions); but one of the book's burning points is that this may be a failing of my person and not his philosophy. \n\nAlso a meta-philosophy: \n<blockquote><i>By working with scientists I get a rich diet of fascinating and problematic facts to think about, but by staying a philosopher without a lab or a research grant, I get to think about all the theories and experiments and never have to do the dishes.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>A good library has all the good books. A great library has all the books. If you really want to understand a great philosopher, you have to spend some time looking at the less great contemporaries and predecessors that are left in the shadows of the masters.</i> </blockquote>\n\nEvery book of his I read increases my respect.

Blasted through this nonfiction novella with great delight; so much astonishing Victorian detail, so much damn fun. The story of two hardcore spies, American and Boer, who ranged over the eC20th, blowing things up and meeting presidents and dissing Churchill’s fitness level and mining by hand as an anti-fascist action and striking oil and maybe killing lords – who campaigned together to bring an invasive species in to eat another invasive species and introduce a new meat animal to America. Duquesne to Burnham: \r\n<blockquote><i>To my friendly enemy, the greatest scout in the world, whose \r\neyes were the vision of an empire. I craved the honour of killing him, \r\nbut failing that, I extend my heartiest admiration.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo damn fun, and, in the last instance, also deep. Mooallem reproaches us for having clicked on American Hippopotamus to make fun of the men. But:\r\n<blockquote> <i>Rather than diversify and expand our stock of animals, we developed ways to raise more of the same animals in more places. Gradually, that process led to the factory farms and mass-confinement operations we have today—a mammoth industry whose everyday practices and waste products are linked to all kinds of dystopian mayhem, from the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, to a spate of spontaneous abortions in Indiana, to something called blue baby syndrome, in which infants actually turn blue after drinking formula mixed with tap water that’s been polluted by runoff from nearby feedlots. That same runoff also sloshes down the Mississippi River to its mouth, pooling into one of the world’s biggest aquatic dead zones, seven or eight thousand square miles large at times...\r\n\r\n These aren’t problems that America created so much as ones we’ve watched happen — consequences of our having ducked other, earlier problems by rigging together relatively unambitious solutions that seemed safe enough. We answered the Meat Question. But there were more meat questions ahead. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nSimple, thoughtful, astonishingly well-written.",

    "review": "Remarkable meta-ethics, which establishes itself in large part by undermining neoclassical economics. Important quibble: The title evokes sexy French relativism – e.g. there is no fact of the matter, il n’y a pas de hors-texte – whereas his actual thesis is that only the strictest, stupidest partition between facts and values collapsed. (A distinction is the mild statement that A is not the same thing as B – whereas a dichotomy is the strict logical exclusion of two things: ‘if something is A, it is a priori not B’.) A pedantic quibble: god he is fond of italics. \r\n\r\nAnyway. It collapsed, but still lives on in other fields, decades after the fall of the positivism that was the only thing motivating it. Book is: a scathing modern history of the distinction, a Pragmatic reconstruction, a love letter to Amartya Sen. Putnam blames the philosophical dichotomy for the failures of economics, and from there for real suffering. \r\n<blockquote>\r\n <i>The word “cruel”... has a normative and indeed, ethical use.  If one asks me what sort of person my child’s teacher is, and I say \"he is very cruel,\" I have both criticized him as a teacher and…as a man.  I do not have to add, \"he is not a good teacher\" or \"he is not a good man.\"  I cannot simply... say, \"he is a very cruel person and a good man,\" and be understood.  Yet \"cruel\" can also be used purely descriptively, as when a historian writes that a certain monarch was exceptionally cruel, or that the cruelties of the regime provoked a number of rebellions.  \"Cruel\" simply ignores the supposed fact/value dichotomy and cheerfully allows itself to be used sometimes for a normative purpose and sometimes as a descriptive term.  (Indeed, the same is true of the term \"crime.\")</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSome claims: Factual and evaluative statements are necessarily entangled, since; Facts are ascertained <i>as such</i> only by the application of epistemic values: \"coherence, plausibility, reasonableness, simplicity, and elegance... if these epistemic values do enable us to correctly describe the world... that is something we see through the lenses of those very values.\"; i.e. facts are thick too; i.e. he has been made to \"<i>rethinking the whole dogma (the last dogma of empiricism?) that facts are objective and values are subjective</i>\". Of course, coupled to his ditching foundationalism, this leads him a long way down the Rortyan road - 'science is just another social practice' yada yada - but he tries to salvage a sort of pragmatic objectivity for science. Dunno if he's winning, but I loved the race.",

By the time I found James, I was withering sick from years of people and books attacking the modern world, spending all their time reducing absolutely everything in life to its politics. \n\n(Larkin is a great poet and was a terrible man, easy as that – but this tension is unbearable to some, who throw out his great work and try to shame those who don't.)\n\nClive James is the consummate droll liberal railing against both wings of partisans: he’s against celebrity culture, Ostalgie, and anti-American critical-theoretical cuteness, but also ‘clash of civilisation’ nonsense, socially destructive austerity and conservatism in the arts.\n\nWhat others get out of Wodehouse or Rowling, I get from this grumpy old Australian’s stoic nonfiction. I had my notebook handy the whole way through, sieving out gold gobbets of late style. \n\nHis essays are a space beyond the culture war, where the personal is not usually political. He is one of the greatest living stylists, would deserve study for that alone.\n\nHis long essay on Isaiah Berlin is fantastic and contentious, and his retorts to the professional philosophers who come at him about it are devastating, inspiring.\n\nUnlike say Geoff Dyer, to whom he is similar, James doesn't have academic standing. So his work is at risk of fading away, without their dull but chronic oxygen.\n\n",

    "review": "Damn: impressed. The title’s supreme arrogance is misleading: his prose is clear, stylish and flowing, he's expert in the relevant experiments, and he’s much less hectoring in book form – he admits his theory’s counter-intuitive and hostile appearance, he flags alternate positions and possibilities, and it’s hard to doubt him when he says he’d change his mind if the science pointed away from his detailed eliminativism. \r\n\r\nI am <i>very</i> resistant to eliminative materialism – in fact I’ve never been able to take it seriously - so that he manages to patch over my failure of imagination is a mark of the book’s power. \r\n\r\nYou begin to wonder – for instance when he talks about his work on children with multiple personalities disorder – if he’s cultivating a humane exterior to make his theory more palatable. But it's probably just that our backlash against his loud, cartoon atheism overlooks his humanity. \r\n\r\nThe first section, where he admits the wonder and difficulty of studying consciousness, and carefully lays out the method ahead, is a model for modern scientifically engaged philosophy – and at the end he suggests a dozen novel, detailed experiments to test his theory (ante up). Can't ignore him.\r\n\r\nMinus a point for being twenty years old on a topic where that matters. \r\n",

Its surrealism, puns (<i>Mrs Risenshein, an LOL in NAD</i> [litle old lady in no obvious distress]), sexual glibness earn it a right to sentimentality in the face of human filth and pain:\r\n<i><blockquote>\r\nWe fought. She probably knew we were fighting about Dr. Sanders’s long dying and about the illusion in my father’s letters and about my plethora of absent role models and the blossoming idea that the gomers were not our patients but our adversaries, and most of all we were fighting over the guilt that I felt for having Molly in a dark corner of the ward standing up, this Molly, who, like me, wouldn’t stop and think and feel either, because if she ruminated on what she felt about enemas and emesis basins, she’d lose faith even in her centipede and want to kill herself too. Our fight was not the violent, howling, barking fight that keeps alive vestiges of love, but that tired, distant, silent fight where the fighters are afraid to punch for fear the punch will kill. So this is it, I thought dully, four months into the internship and I’ve become an animal, a mossbrained moose who did not and could not and would not think and talk, and it’s come like an exhausted cancerous animal to my always love, my buddy Berry, and me–yes it’s come to us: Relationship On Rocks...</i</blockquote>\r\nShem's dialogue is pleasurable - the Flann O'Joyce variety of brainy silliness.

The young doctor says that with the aid of an operation, with the usefulness of the scalpel being demonstrated, you will survive.\" \r\n\"-Dr Basch, I believe that I now have no need of the last rites. If so, could the priest depart? He scares me in the memory of how close to heaven or that hot other place I came.\"\r\n\"-And is there a message for the little woman, the wife?\" the Commissioner asked as the priest left...\r\n\"Ah well, all the best boyo, and I'm on my way to your wife and will soothe her with my boyish good looks and TV-cop mien. Good-bye, and for the young scholar here who saved your fine red life, SHALOM and God bless.\"\r\nSavage, all of it, savage.</blockquote></i>\r\nLike any psychologically ambitious work of the mid-C20th, it has a lot of Freud in it, much of it going unchallenged. The book is also about the distress and pain of an extremely lucky and insulated and remunerated man surrounded by women who do massive amounts for him, but you mostly forget this, it is that good. \r\n\r\nI imagine there are still pockets of people out there who still believe in the 1950s George Clooney heroism and omnicompetence of doctors.

    "review": "Investigation of what angry people are doing to jokers and liars and fools, generally on the internet, generally on political grounds. We send them death threats, we photoshop them into animal porn, we doxx them, we get them fired. If Ronson's shock and remorse at being part of this could spread, the most distinctive depressing part of modern life would evaporate. \r\n\r\nThere is only one representative of the online shamers here (besides Ronson, who is reformed). You realise quickly that she is not especially hateful: she's just <i>dim</i> –  she still thinks shaming is great, even after suffering it horribly and losing her job as a result of her own aggressive humourlessness and insensitivity. In her interview with Ronson, she shows no signs of empathy or learning. It is a tragic example of how addling identity can be.\r\n\r\nOne essential passage - the payload inamongst Ronson's ordinariness and self-deprecation: a human-rights lawyer points out the emotional power of noncriminal acts:\r\n<blockquote><i>“Let me ask you three questions,” he said. “And then you’ll see it my way. Question One: What’s the worst thing that you have ever done to someone? It’s okay. You don’t have to confess it out loud. Question Two: What’s the worst criminal act that has ever been committed against you? Question Three: Which of the two was the most damaging for the victim?”\r\n\r\nThe worst criminal act that has ever been committed against me was burglary. How damaging was it? Hardly damaging at all. I felt theoretically violated at the idea of a stranger wandering through my house. But I got the insurance money. I was mugged one time. I was eighteen. The man who mugged me was an alcoholic. He saw me coming out of a supermarket. “Give me your alcohol,” he yelled. He punched me in the face, grabbed my groceries, and ran away. There wasn’t any alcohol in my bag. I was upset for a few weeks, but it passed.\r\n\r\nAnd what was the worst thing I had ever done to someone? It was a terrible thing. It was devastating for them. It wasn’t against the law.\r\n\r\nClive’s point was that the criminal justice system is supposed to repair harm, but most prisoners — young, black — have been incarcerated for acts far less emotionally damaging than the injuries we noncriminals perpetrate upon one another all the time — bad husbands, bad wives, ruthless bosses, bullies, bankers.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n(It <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/132/setting_community_norms_and_values_a_response_to/8sv?context=1#8sv\">has been claimed</a> that this phase of internet social justice is on its way out - that the tactic is now to \"<a href=\"http://www.humanityinaction.org/files/567-N.Trn-CallingIN.pdf\">call in</a>\"- that is, to correct an offender, but also to appeal to the offender's humanity, to try to bridge the gap. We can hope this will gain traction (3 years and counting...). In the meantime a roaring subculture has been founded upon the glorification of bad behaviour and utterly unpersuasive flames.)\r\n\r\nRonson's possible solutions to finding yourself shamed: you can 1) refuse to feel bad (or at least refuse to show them you're bleeding), own the thing they're trying to shame you for, like Max Mosley. This only works sometimes. 2) You can hide from the internet, try to SEO the affair down to Google page 3, where no-one goes, like someone it would be counterproductive to name. 3) You can start over, asking for forgiveness like Jonah Lehrer. (There is none; the internet is not interested in you improving your behaviour.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[<a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Theory #3, Values #1</a>]</li>",

    "review": "A very broad swathe from Estonia's most stately rustic. He keeps a high eyrie but has a fatherly musk as well. It's a chilly nest though - occasionally anti-human:\r\n<blockquote><i>It gets cold in the evening. The sky clears.\r\nThe wind dies out, and the smoke \r\nrises straight up. The flowering maple\r\nno longer buzzes. A carp\r\nplops in the pond. An owl hoots twice\r\nin its nest in the ash tree.\r\nThe children are asleep. On the stairs,\r\na long row of shoes and rubber boots.\r\nIt happened near Viljandi: an imbecile boy\r\npoured gasoline on the neighbour's three-year-old\r\nand set him on fire. I ran for milk.\r\nYou could see the yellow maple from far off\r\nbetween the birches and the spruce. The evening star\r\nwas shining above the storehouse. The boy survived,\r\nprobably maimed for life. The night will bring frost.\r\nPlentiful dew.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nHe gets called a particularly European (a particularly Unionised) poet, and this is true enough: Kant's rationalist cool and Smith's pragmatism really are pedal notes in him. But there are snippets of <i>nine</i> languages in this mid-sized selection, including Sanskrit and Japanese (the ukiyo-e/mono-no-aware rhythms of which he owes a great deal to) and a poke of originals in pragmatic, wriggling English. That is, he's really a globalist. His own Estonian (\"serious, greyish\") is of course not remotely Indo-European, instead fluting and crashing, riverine, out of the Urals. (It would be silly to say that his work's bleak because some people he is descended from came from Siberia, but if I were a marketer rather than a gadfly it would be a good hook.) Let's complicate matters with two other sides, the paternal domestic and the wide-eyed enquirer:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Lines do not perhaps exist; there are only points.\r\nJust as there are no constellations, only stars\r\nwhich we combine into water-carriers, fish, rams, \r\nvirgins, scorpions and ourselves…\r\nConstellations, contours, profiles, \r\noutlines, ground plans, principles, reasons, \r\nulterior motives and consequences…\r\nA solitary birch holds onto its last leaves by the woodshed.\r\nOr the leaves hold onto the birch.\r\nOr there is someone holds onto both, \r\na child holding his father's and mother's hands at once.\r\nI am sorry for them – the child, the leaves \r\nthe father, the birch and the mother.\r\nBut I do not know, really, for whom: if the birch exists,\r\nif there are only points. I do not want the winter.\r\nBut I do not know whether the winter really exists. There are only points.\r\nThere are only molecules and atoms, which increasingly slowly, \r\nwhich is roughly the same as saying: warms disperses\r\nthroughout space. Both the child's hands were cold.\r\nNight is coming - light is roughly the same as warmth.\r\nLight scatters in the empty room. New thoughts \r\ncome so seldom. Your hand is warm. So is the night.\r\nThe poem is ready. If the poem exists at all:\r\nthere are only points. It is dark.</i></blockquote>\r\nThis wonderful latter aside (and anti-poetry though he is) I do not like him constantly bringing up poetry; the poems where he does are often po-faced and contentless. But he is a master and it's his business what he chooses to cool by just gazing at it.",

    "review": "An oppressive book or a book about the maximal oppression. It is a dozen case studies of profoundly frozen people: contorted, whispering, impassive for decades - at best. It describes one of the most poignant real events I think I've ever heard of: the medical reversal of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis_lethargica\">effective, affective death</a> - and but only a temporary reversal. Sacks really hadn't developed his style by this point: I quite liked the technical medical report feel, but it both highly technical and highly melodramatic: there is much of infinitudes of the soul, titratabilities, and perseveratably festinative resipiscences in it. Also a nice subtle stylistic note: he breaks apart dead metaphors to revive them (e.g. \"wild life\", \"death bed\").\r\n\r\nAlso lacking is his later grand balancing of romance with reason.* For instance, he falls right off the edge on pp.97, seeing numbers as enemies of people:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>I suddenly realised the infinite nature, the qualitative infinity of the phenomenon... One speaks of infinite anguishes, poignancies, desires, and joys - and one does so naturally, with no sense of paradox - i.e. one conceives of them in a metaphysical sense. But Parkinsonism - wasn't this categorically different? Was it not a simple, mechanical disorder of function - something essentially finite, something which could be measured in the divisions of a suitable scale? ... When I saw Hester, I suddenly realised that all I had thought about the finite, ponderable, numerable nature of Parkinsonism was nonsense. I suddenly realized, at this moment, that Parkisonism could in no sense be seen as a thing which increased or decreased by finite increments... that it was anumerical; that from its first, infinitesimal intimation it could proceed by an infinite multitude of infinitesimal increments to an infinite, and then more infinite, and still more infinite, degree of severity... [Footnote twenty years later] I see it as requiring models or concepts which had not been created in the 1960s, in particular those of chaos and nonlinear dynamics.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>We rationalize, we dissimilate, we pretend: we pretend that modern medicine is a rational science, all facts, no nonsense, and just what it seems. But we have only to tap its glossy veneer for it to split wide open, and reveal to us its roots and foundations, its old dark heart of metaphysics, mysticism, magic, and myth. Medicine is the oldest of the arts, and the oldest of the sciences: would one not expect it to spring from the deepest knowledge and feelings we have?</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nIt's a repetitive book for a maximally repetitive disease. The wonder and personalising detail he lavishes on each case aren't enough to get me past the surprising uniformity of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculogyric_crisis\">bizarre symptoms</a> and the hell of it all. Just as well I'm not a doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n* Call it the <i>classical</i> vs the <i>romantic</i> (as does Pirsig), <i>Erklaerung</i> oder <i>Verstehen</i> (as in Dilthey, Weber), the <i>outside view</i> v the <i>inside view</i> (Kahneman), or <i>Logos</i> v <i>Mythos</i> (as twere in ancient Greece). \r\n</blockquote>",

    "review": "Neal Stephenson once hyperbolised the situation in OS choice as follows:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>Linux is right next door and is not a business at all. It's a bunch of RVs, yurts, tepees, and geodesic domes set up in a field and organized by consensus. The people who live there are making tanks. These are not old-fashioned, cast-iron Soviet tanks; these are more like the M1 tanks of the U.S. Army, made of space-age materials and jammed with sophisticated technology from one end to the other. But they are better than Army tanks. They've been modified in such a way that they never, ever break down, are light and maneuverable enough to use on ordinary streets, and use no more fuel than a subcompact car. These tanks are being cranked out, on the spot, at a terrific pace, and a vast number of them are lined up along the edge of the road with keys in the ignition. Anyone who wants can simply climb into one and drive it away for free. </i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThis is overstated; Debian and Ubuntu, the chief consumer descendents, are as buggy as any other. But the very same people built Git, and it is a battle-tank. Fast, unbreakable and life-saving. Why hasn't it taken over the world, outside of tech industry? 1) most people don't need non-linear incremental backups; 2) the learning curve is bloody steep even for techies.\r\n\r\nEntities that you need to know about to use Git without absurdity: the files, the working tree, the index, many local repositories, many remote repositories, 'remotes' (pointers to remote repositories), commits, treeishes (pointers to commits), branches, a stash\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;git gets easier once you get the basic idea that branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of a Hilbert space.&quot;</p>&mdash; chi wai lau (@tabqwerty) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tabqwerty/status/45611899953491968\">March 9, 2011</a></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\nThis book covers so much of the internal detail, the gotchas, the customisability, and comparisons with other source-control systems that it was adopted as canonical docs by the official working group.

    "review": "Picked this up looking for a laugh, so my god. Of sordid, heartbroken, soft totalitarianism. The ineliminable danger of being different, and the specific danger for one difference in particular. A companion piece to <i>The Book of Dave</i>, underneath Britain's (and humanity's) downside. \r\n\r\n: Britain insulates itself against a self-inflicted atrocity by pushing away history and strongly banning modernist or pessimist ideas and people. So many despicable characters, like the art professor who defines everything by how little it reflects darkness or human brutality, 'primitivism' and 'degeneracy' (the irony being that this attitude, of art as mere grinning decoration, is itself a backslide from modernism, however empty and stupid much conceptual art is).\r\n<blockquote><i>There was something uncanny about her, the seriousness with which she took her work, her obduracy, the size of her vocabulary, the lack of bounce in her hair, the flat shoes she wore, her failure often to get a joke, her way of overdoing sympathy as as though understanding beat snogging.</i></blockquote>\r\nThe book (if not Jacobson) has a terrifying attitude towards bigotry: that it's never going away because it based on the deep need of exclusive identity, that bad marriages and ethnic atrocities appeal to something much deeper and more formal than what happens to have been socialised into us. 'Necessary Opposites', as he puts it:\r\n<blockquote><i>'...Identity is nothing but illusion.'\r\n'If it's all illusion, why has it caused so much misery?'\r\n... \r\n'Only when we have a different state to strive against do we have reason to strive at all. And different people the same. I am me because I am not her, or you. If we were all red earthworms there'd be no point in life. Identity is just the name we give to making ourselves distinct.'\r\n'So you're saying it's irrelevant what our identities really are? As long as we assume one and fight against someone else's.'\r\n'I'd say so, yes. Pretty much.'\r\n'Isn't that a bit arbitrary?'\r\n'Perhaps. But isn't everything? There's no design.' </i></blockquote>\r\nIt starts slow, give it 50 pages to worm its way.\r\n",

    "review": "Sickly-satisfying but blunt satire on memory, gender and the dark side of memes. A bunch of polymorphous, polyamorous, post-scarcity posthumans volunteer for a closed-system experiment replicating the strictures of 1990s <a href=\"http://www.ohio.edu/people/thompsoc/Body.html\">Nacirema</a>, and are quite rightly appalled by the prison of social norms and physical limitations. (Not to mention the sinister panopticon modifications of the experimenters, with a public point-scoring table of conformism and no contraception.) The space-opera frame (a software virus that censors people's minds) is good too, wielding the deepest creepiness: brainwashing which actually works.\r\n<blockquote>\t<i>I've been thinking that maybe I lucked out with him - there's potential for abuse in this 'atomic relationship' thing...</i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<i>Time is a corrosive fluid, dissolving motivation, destroying novelty, and leaching the joy from life. But forgetting is a fraught process, one that is prone to transcription errors and personality flaws. Delete the wrong pattern, and you can end up becoming someone else. Memories exhibit dependencies, and their management is one of the highest medical art forms.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n         \r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<i>Where would dictators be without our compliant amnesia? Make the collective lose its memory, you can conceal anything.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<i>At moments like this I hate being an unreconstructed human - an island of thinking jelly trapped in a bony carapace, endless milliseconds away from its lovers, forced to squeeze every meaning through a low-bandwidth speech channel. All men are islands, surrounded by the bottomless oceans of unthinking night</i>.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nI love him for his quiet use of the technical for emotional ends, as when two characters \"<a href=\"http://help.sap.com/saphelp_hanaplatform/helpdata/en/20/f8d0a175191014a7c192193b8645a9/content.htm\">merge their deltas</a>\".

    "review": "His last book: a half-rational vehicle for his late contrarian mystical worldview; in fact it reads as his making amends for the vivid bioconservative paranoia of <i>Brave New World</i>. It certainly handles the same themes, simply inverted in their consequences: we see drugs as <i>enablers</i> of enlightenment; a much healthier view of suffering, as a pointless trap; a surprisingly pragmatic view of genetic engineering; and a very balanced view of civilisation and economic development. \r\n\r\nSo: he constructs a Taoist-Hindu-Buddhist utopia which mostly avoids primitivism and annoying mysticism for a sustainable East plus West non-industrial modernity. It's not my idea of paradise, but other people's utopias usually aren't. Moreover, it is a <i>doomed</i> utopia nestled in nasty 1950s international political economy. The animating enemy of <i>Island</i> is not the authoritarian consequences of technology, but what Scott Alexander <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">calls Moloch</a>: the forces of self-fulfilling inevitability and destructive competition.\r\n\r\nProtagonist is a mirror of John the Savage: an open-minded liar and shill, a fallen outsider who manages to undermine the utopia he infiltrates. Huxley himself is the model for him: in fact we can see Will's journey from cynical aestheticism to materialist spirituality as autobiography in allegory. The mystic character, Rani, is amazing: an enraging theosophical flake. This reflects well on Huxley's own weirdness: the Rani is as far from traditional organised religion as Huxley is from her.\r\n\r\nGiven the times and his project, lots of Huxley's worldview have <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny\">become clichés</a>: e.g. “you forget to pay attention to what's happening. And that's the same as not being here and now ”. The prose is arch and syrupy but I like it. (<i>BNW</i> is saddled by the air of a smug jeremiad. <i>Island</i> is every bit as didactic but nowhere near as smug.) It's chock-full of bad poetry though. I love his use of reported speech to denote characters he disrespects: this saves him the bother of writing it and us the bother  of reading and makes a conspiracy of us and Huxley: \r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<i>He turned to Will and treated him to a long and flowery farewell. \r\n\r\n<br><i>In polysyllables, Mr Bahu hedged diplomatically. On the one hand, yes; but on  the other hand, no. From one point of view, white; but from a different angle, distinctly black.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nPala's structure is cool but not at all radical enough to solve what is wrong with us, I think – technology is controlled very carefully and considered one of the 'dozens' of fronts to aid people on. (Hypnotherapy and tantra are given way more credit than they deserve, for instance.) Is “one-third” of suffering intrinsic? I look forward to science seeing if that is the case. I elect Huxley into the hall of fame of people who make a very popular error and later recant to no acclaim. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model\">Niels Bohr</a> (and his memetically dominant false model), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument#Frank_Jackson\">Frank Jackson</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Gide#Russia\">André Gide</a>, Bertrand Russell, ...)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Can we call a <i>novel</i> mistaken? As a whole, not in some particular claim of a character. No. 'Misguided', or ideologically harmful, maybe.",

    "review": "Whistle-stop hyperbole in the way of Continentals, but grounded by technical knowledge and uncliched. (Owing to its techno-optimism: it is uncliched to be a philosopher optimistic about tech.)\r\n<blockquote><i>The history of modern thought has been characterised by an increasing gap between mind and reality. It is a process of epistemic detachment which has been irresistible ever since it began, and quite inevitably so. Knowledge develops as mind’s answer to the presence of the non-mental. It is the means whereby the subject establishes a minimal distance, and emancipates itself, from the object. The rise of dualism and the escalating interaction between traditional knowledge, as an object, and innovative knowledge, as a further reaction to it, has led to the emergence of a new world.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNotice the skilled and non-fatuous use of phenomenological blah! Chapter 2, his fast and very formal discussion of Boole, Gödel and Turing, took me about half a week. The tiny concluding chapter – in which he locates computers in the history of human freedom, as Hephaestean handmaids – makes me giddy. Slightly dated where it talks PC specs, and he loves a goofy neologism (“egology”, “corporeal membranes”), but grand, sceptical, grand, supervenient. \r\n\r\n\r\n(His ‘<a href=\"http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/publications/pdf/tinopi.pdf\">Informational Nature of Personal Identity</a>’ and ‘<a href=\"http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/11646/906518.pdf?sequence=2\">Turing’s Three Lessons</a>’ are better.)\r\n\r\n",

    "review": "Good stuff! Earthy, economic sci-fi; aliens visit, ignore us entirely, and soon leave, leaving behind only transcendent junk and horror-film phenomena from their little picnic. Prose is lovely and plain, translated brilliantly by the mathematician Olena Bormashenko (we get “scabby”, “sham”, “mange”). \r\n\r\nThe ordinary, crude protagonist Red is scrabbling illegally to provide for his mutant family (the Strugatskys use cash and cash pressure amazingly, grounding the whole cosmic fantasy in commerce, crime, exploitation). Every time Red gets cash, he throws it away – in someone’s face as an insult, in someone’s face as a distraction to evade capture, or just away. \r\n\r\nNo explanations except bureaucratic filler; no salvation, just dumb defiance. A really nice original touch is that Red interprets the body language of his friends in extreme detail – a scratched nose means, to him, “Whoah, Red, be careful how rough you play with the new kid”. \r\n\r\nAlso notable for being a Soviet novel set in mid-west America, evoked very, very well. And the Russian Soul under their dismal economics rings out without catching in the barrel:\r\n<i><blockquote>HAPPINESS, FREE, FOR EVERYONE; LET NO ONE BE FORGOTTEN!</i></blockquote>",

    "review": "Was very impressed by this first time round, but the subsequent scholarly pushback convinces me it's too flawed to endorse without including this list of corrections:\r\n\r\n* <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2543012\">Magness</a>: Piketty's data don't account for bias in income tax reporting. This undermines his claim that inequality is now as bad as it was in the early 1900s: when tax codes change dramatically, as they did through the pre-war period and in 1986, the data become unrepresentative (without adjustment). After adjustment, it looks like inequality fell much less in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion\">postwar boom</a> and has risen much less, post-80s.\r\n* <a href=\"http://mattrognlie.com/piketty_diminishing_returns.pdf\">Rognlie</a> and <a href=\"https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/spowpecon/info_3ahdl_3a2441_2f30nstiku669glbr66l6n7mc2oq.htm\">Bonnet et al</a>: Piketty calculated the increase in capital share wrong, it's a lot lower; price appreciation (benefiting the rich) is not general, instead driven by housing. This mostly benefits single-home-owners, who use their capital by living in it, and so aren't 'rentiers'; thus Piketty is mostly wrong about the rise of rentier capitalism. Also, housing shortages are often political rather than fundamental, which again undermines the big anti-capital policy implication. \r\n* <a href=\"http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/teaching/FurmanOrszag15.pdf\">Furman and Orszag</a>: Piketty's explanation for extreme income disparities (: large increases in corporate-executive bargaining power) isn't right; instead only a small group of monopolistic tech firms (\"superstars\") display this.  \r\n* <a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/files/11348\">Acemoglu and Robinson</a>: The evidence is mostly strongly against his three fundamental laws of capitalism. Most importantly, the elasticity of substitution of capital for labour is less than one; therefore, Piketty's main mechanism for explaining inequality cannot be true.\r\n* <a href=\"http://www.deirdremccloskey.org/docs/pdf/PikettyReviewEssay.pdf\">McCloskey</a>: lots of errors.\r\n\r\nPiketty's core claims:<blockquote>\r\n1. the capital share of national income has risen (at the expense of labour share).\r\n2. <i>r > g</i>; wealth generally grows faster than economic output.\r\n3. whenever <i>r > g</i>, inequality will rise because capital gets concentrated in fewer hands. \r\n3b. <i>r</i> (the return to capital) won't change much in response to a decline in growth rate, because the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is high.\r\n4. The capital-output ratio will be worse in the future.\r\n5. Therefore large wealth tax now, or both capitalism and democracy will die. \r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe above research finds that the first is true in some places (in the UK, the US and Canada?), but each of the middle three is questionable. (4) could happen but we're not given much reason to think it inevitable. Summary: Piketty's data collection and descriptive work is mostly good, his analysis and modelling is flawed enough to undo his policy recommendations (5).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe resentful econ undergrad in me thrilled to see Piketty saying this:\r\n <blockquote><i>To put it bluntly, the discipline of economics has yet to get over its childish passion for mathematics and for purely theoretical and often highly ideological speculation, at the expense of historical research and collaboration with the other social sciences. Economists are all too often preoccupied with petty mathematical problems of interest only to themselves. This obsession with mathematics is an easy way of acquiring the appearance of scientificity without having to answer the far more complex questions posed by the world we live in. There is one great advantage of being an academic economist in France: here, economists are not highly respected in the academic and intellectual world or by political and financial elites. Hence they must set aside their contempt for other disciplines and their absurd claim to greater scientific legitimacy, despite the fact that they know almost nothing about anything.</i></blockquote> \r\n\r\n He's keen to emphasise his ideological hygiene, that he's a real-deal empiricist. Weighed down by overstatement of its own achievement (“the fundamental laws of capitalism”). \r\n\r\nWith a few more diagrams and boxed definitions, this would make an excellent intro macro textbook, gentle and empirically obsessive as it is. Lot of redundancy - whoa-there steady-now summary paragraphs every few pages - but I suppose that's what you need to do if you aim to be understood by policymakers.",

Uniquely in punk, PP showed the <i>muddiness</i> of the ideology in things; the genuinely thoughtful people here interviewed share a tendency to blur party lines. \r\n\r\nThere are radicals talking radically in the usual manner (Chomsky, Biafra) but also practitioners of social good (the Central Ohio Abortion Access Fund and the remarkable <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Kelly\">Voices in the Wilderness</a>), iconoclasts of iconoclasm (Hanna, Mackaye) and even a few apolitical ethical-egoist libertines (Albini, Frank Kozik) who are common in punk, but rare in its commentary. \r\n\r\nSinker’s super-earnest intro text inserts all the right misgivings about Chumbawumba’s entryism or Kozik’s blithe first-generation patriotism; he somehow retains his beautiful faith in ‘Punk’ (as empowering civil-disobedient grass-roots social justice) in the face of vast variation in actual punks.\r\n\r\nMy own attempt at the social meaning of punk gave up on seeing it as one thing (or even as generally good things) entirely.

    "review": "Because we have gotten better, old radicals often seem less radical over time. The pragmatic hedonism and secular calm of Epicurus was once fanatically detested, but is now a standard worldview (it's roughly that of the happy scientist); at one time Spinoza’s Ethics (determinism, Nature as deity, religious and political tolerance) was the wildest thing ever said in the history of the Christian world; Montesquieu’s disgust at aristocratic brutality, gross luxury and torture are commonplaces; Paine’s raging insistence on human rights and total secularism are very successful (in Europe at least); and anyone who disagrees with duBois’ or MLK’s aims is foolish or virulent. \r\n\r\nMalcolm X has not yet been incorporated in this way - but, reading his less ranty stuff (not the early “<i>TOO BLACK, TOO STRONG</i>” variety) you wonder why. Might have been his influential homophobia, but that’s hardly stopped other thinkers. (<a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2010/05/was_malcolm_x_really_that_radical.html\">This suggests</a> it's because we have a false, caricature of him in mind, one that believes in whites-as-devils and Fanonian purifying violence.) \r\n\r\nDyson does not skimp on his downsides, and tackles the thorniest idea in identity politics: that experience is absolute, and so understanding a group’s ideas and values <i>requires</i> group membership – that ideas have colour as people do.

These sections are connected by each having a 'reader' (the opening sea journal is read by the second narrator, the Romantic composer, whose letters are obsessed over by the journalist, whose memoir is seen by the hack editor, whose tale is seen in an ancient film by the saintly clone, who is remembered as a god in the post-apocalypse story that is as far forward as we see. (They are also connected by a reincarnation overlay - but, apart from giving brutal history more chances to be brutal to the same people, I don't really get it.) \r\n\r\nThe bit with the composer, Frobisher, is my favourite: he transcends his cheeky bohemian archetype and becomes horribly tragic despite his pig-headedness and camp pretension. \r\n\r\nThe last line, returning to the original Victorian narrator, is a good summary of the book's wounded, pessimistic collectivism: \r\n<blockquote><i>He who would do battle with the many-headed hydra of human nature must pay a world of pain & his family must pay it along with him! & only as you gasp your dying breath shall you understand, your life amounted to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean!’  \r\nYet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops?</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nSo: Enjoyable and ambitious, unsatisfying.",

    "review": "Dense, clever, and it conveys a pleasant worldview; but also rushed and clumsy. In fact the prose is awful - full of flat descriptions of people's reactions, people's full names inserted into the dialogue - and the characters are completely interchangeable ciphers (apart from the one who is a stock renegade cop, and the one who is the Ultimate Eco-Terrorist). \r\n<blockquote><i>Can the fundamental nature of matter really be lawlessness? Can the stability and order of the world be but a temporary dynamic equilibrium achieved in a corner of the universe, a short-lived eddy in a chaotic current?</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere's almost no '<a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell\">showing</a>' in the entire book.\r\n<blockquote><i>For most people, perhaps time would have gradually healed these wounds. After all, during the Cultural Revolution, many people suffered fates similar to hers, and compared to many of them, Ye was relatively fortunate. But Ye had the mental habits of a scientist, and she refused to forget. Rather, she looked with a rational gaze on the madness and hatred that had harmed her. Ye’s rational consideration of humanity’s evil side began the day she read </i>Silent Spring.<i>\r\n\r\nHave you heard of the Monte Carlo method? Ah, it’s a computer algorithm often used for calculating the area of irregular shapes. Specifically, the software puts the figure of interest in a figure of known area, such as a circle, and randomly strikes it with many tiny balls, never targeting the same spot twice. After a large number of balls, the proportion of balls that fall within the irregular shape compared to the total number of balls used to hit the circle will yield the area of the shape.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThis is no impediment to good hard scifi, it just means that the reference author is Asimov, not Banks or LeGuin. Liu's ideas are well worth the trip - firing at a nuke as a last-resort for disarming it (since the small ones rely on a sealed pressurised container) is about the least ambitious thought in it:\r\n<blockquote><i>Twenty minutes later, Three Body’s Von Neumann architecture human-formation computer had begun full operations under the Qin 1.0 operating system. “Run solar orbit computation software ‘Three Body 1.0’!” Newton screamed at the top of his lungs. “Start the master computing module! Load the differential calculus module! Load the finite element analysis module! Load the spectral method module! Enter initial condition parameters … and begin calculation!” The motherboard sparkled as the display formation flashed with indicators in every color. The human computer began the long computation.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Comrades! Revolutionary youths! Revolutionary faculty and staff! We must clearly understand the reactionary nature of Einstein’s theory of relativity. This is most apparent in general relativity: Its static model of the universe negates the dynamic nature of matter. It is anti-dialectical! It treats the universe as limited, which is absolutely a form of reactionary idealism…</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI don't understand why this won the Hugo - except, that, being foreign, it didn't trigger canned political backlash on either side of the sad affair we have made the Hugos.

    "review": "Contemptible, but worth reading: it gets really good around page 450. The way there is a slog: the de Sade epigrams, the unreflective Freudianism, this:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>It was Greece again, the Alexandrian Greece of Cavafy; there were only degrees of aesthetic pleasure; of beauty in decadence. Morality was a North European lie.</i></blockquote>\r\nSnobbery, delusion, bad sex, worse chat, and the limits of reason: Ladies and gentlemen: we were The Existentialists!\r\n\r\nNot a patch on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Grand_Meaulnes\">Alain-Fournier</a>, nor on <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanark:_A_Life_in_Four_Books\">Lanark</a></i>, nor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invention_of_Morel\">Bioy Casares</a>. The eponymous sage is not sagacious, just imperious. I liked the vignettes that show Conchis' personality as a stolen (or put-on) patchwork of people he had met in his life (the nasty aesthete Comte, the mad Norwegian mystic, the Nazi firing squad). It took quite a long time for me to realise that Fowles might not endorse the nasty blithering of basically every character. (The book seems to have <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/07/the-great-divide-emily-nussbaum\">Bad Fans</a> and Bad Haters who never realise this.) \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>My monstrous crime was Adam's, the oldest and most vicious of all male selfishness: to have imposed the role I needed from Alison on her real self.</i> \r\n</blockquote>\r\nAnyway my time was recompensed by the great big postmodern explosion of the last 150 pages. Some very lovely passages throughout too:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>The bowed head, the buried face. She is silent, she will never speak, never forgive, never reach a hand, never leave this frozen present tense. All waits, suspended. Suspended the autumn trees, the autumn sky, anonymous people. A blackbird, poor fool, sings out of season from the willows by the lake. A flight of pigeons over the houses; fragments of freedom, hazard, an anagram made flesh. And somewhere the stinging smell of burning leaves.</i></blockquote>\r\nThe ending, so easily hated, does not strike me as meaning \"to win love eternal, go on just hit her in the face\", despite appearances. It is rather a parting stab at your opinion of Nicholas, a big Straussian dischord thrown into the supposed perfect cadence of the godgame people's efforts; Lily's grand second commandment dissolves suddenly, saltily, and then: a warm mist descends. Go guess.\r\n\r\nFine if you're a glutton for philosophical dialogues and <i>Truman Show</i> recursions.",

    "review": "The emotional case for not being religious. I should like him - he is the most honourable instance of a public figure rationally changing his mind in living memory. And another thing sorely needed: a sympathetic, literate public nonbeliever. Also he quotes poetry from memory - for its sense, not in order to curry literary status. (We know this because he leaves the attribution of the poems to the endnotes.) He is adorable, basically, and <a href=\"http://afterallitcouldbeworse.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/highlighted-passages-in-holloways.html\">quotable</a> to boot. But there's a clunkiness too, one I can't quite articulate.\r\n\r\nAs a boy he loved religion's melodrama and un-Scottish grandeur; he goes away to an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Sacred_Mission\">eccentric militarist monastery</a>, aged 14: \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>We were up at six-thirty for a cold shower followed by mass and breakfast. After household chores we were moved into study mode until the next visit to chapel at midday. After lunch, afternoons were given over to heavy labour, either scrubbing and shining floors or labouring for Brother Edward in the grounds... back to study at four, till bells summoned us to Evensong at six-thirty. Then dinner, more washing up and more study. The day ended at nine-thirty with Compline, then lights out... Each evening we left chapel in silence, under the spell of fading plainsong that marked the ending of the day. </i></blockquote>\r\nFun! Rammed full of order and space, but not religion per se. He was always unorthodox: he gave communion to just anyone who walked into church, happily married off divorcees, joined the LGBT movement and even claims to have held a Catholic gay marriage in the 90s. I am childish enough to enjoy his swearing, as the Bishop said to the actress. He had no more place on a <a href=\"http://www.hfea.gov.uk/Authority-members.html\">government bioethics committee</a> than any other nice clever old man, but I don't suppose he did any harm at all.\r\n\r\n<i>In one sentence</i>: Religion is pretty nice, but you must take it less seriously.\r\n",

    "review": "Witty and sloppy synopsis. It is neither materialist nor idealist: he locates power in single people. Or, in anecdotes about people really. (Is that still materialism? Funny kind if so.) \r\n\r\nHe has such a huge throbbing agenda - e.g. his <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IH_eVPFSuxMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=victorians+an+wilson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf1a6m1LzNAhULB8AKHQLJANsQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=benthamite&amp;f=false\">caricature</a> of Bentham, his bizarre claim that capitalism suppresses individuality, rather than being totally, totally dependent on it - but I didn't resent it because he is so patent about it and because he is funny:  <blockquote>\r\n<i>If the </i>[genetic guesses]<i> about both Victoria and Albert are well-grounded, this means that many of the crowned heads of Europe are descended jointly from an unscrupulous Irish soldier and a German Jew. Given this, it is surprising that these families manifested so few of the talents stereotypically attributed to the Irish and the Jews; such as wit or good looks.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Karl Marx, as so often, made an accurate observation of the political scene and drew a false inference from it.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nHe loves Disraeli and Albert, hates Gladstone and Palmerston. I have no idea if this is an original position. Got tired of his tone and scattergun of stories about two-thirds in. About as good as popular history that isn't <a href=\"http://www.fallen.io/ww2/\">data-driven</a> can be.\r\n\r\n<i>In one sentence</i>: This is where modernity - feminism, multiculturalism, managerialism, professionalism, mechanised warfare - originated: in little moments that happened to people who happened to write them down for me.\r\n\r\n",

    "review": "A scary family-dynasty epic told at that point in history where generational gaps grow unbridgeably vast on the spume of telescoping technological progression. First book is a wonderful freewheel through the near-future, with his technolibertarian booster protagonist – <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny\">Sam Altman</a> meets Richard Stallman meets Ventakesh Rao – running around as midwife to the future. Includes a nepotistic jaunt through Edinburgh because why not (it's a tech town after all). It is funny and prescient about our dependence on feeds and open-source expansion. \r\n<blockquote><i>Welcome to the early twenty-first century, human.\r\nIt’s night in Milton Keynes, sunrise in Hong Kong. Moore’s Law rolls inexorably on, dragging humanity toward the uncertain future. The planets of the solar system have a combined mass of approximately 2 x 10<sup>27</sup> kilograms. Around the world, laboring women produce forty-five thousand babies a day, representing 10<sup>23</sup> MIPS of processing power. Also around the world, fab lines casually churn out thirty million microprocessors a day, representing 10<sup>23</sup> MIPS. In another ten months, most of the MIPS being added to the solar system will be machine-hosted for the first time.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThe confusing part is that the first third of it is among my favourite books and I recommend it often. But the later books work less well; they become less and less convincing as we reach the singularity (his grasp of the physics and the economics of computers and space is characteristically excellent, and it's all hard enough) - more and more of that omniscient voiceover guy is needed.  \r\n<blockquote><i>Not everyone is concerned with the deep future. But </i>it’s<i> important! If we live or die, that doesn’t matter—that’s not the big picture. The big question is whether information originating in our light cone is preserved, or whether we’re stuck in a lossy medium where our very existence counts for nothing. It’s downright embarrassing to be a member of a species with such a profound lack of curiosity about its own future, especially when it affects us all personally!\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nI agree with Kahneman, though, that it's wrong to put as much weight on a weak ending as people tend to; the experiencing self, who was deeply impressed most of the time, should not be relegated so.\r\n<blockquote><i>In the distance, the cat hears the sound of lobster minds singing in the void, a distant feed streaming from their cometary home as it drifts silently out through the asteroid belt, en route to a chilly encounter beyond Neptune. The lobsters sing of alienation and obsolescence, of intelligence too slow and tenuous to support the vicious pace of change that has sandblasted the human world until all the edges people cling to are jagged and brittle.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nAs always, many incredible thoughts embodied in very vivid scenes – it deserves the technical glossary <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Accelerando_Technical_Companion\">supplied by fans here</a> - and you've no regrets about spending time with him. But again I've the patronising sense that he fluffed it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBook I 5/5, Book II 3/5, Book III 2/5. \r\n\r\n[<a href=\"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html\">Free!</a> here.]\r\n",

    "review": "The protagonist is cartoonish, full of piratical energy, but saved from a boring super-soldier effect by pathos of the <i>Bad Lieutenant</i> variety. Banks was always quite open about how didactic the sci-fi novels were; they are saved by his sheer inventiveness and the grand psychological realism amidst the technological fantasy. \r\n\r\n: What do humans have to offer, after the singularity? What skills are scarce? Banks' answer is: \"a lack of scruples; excessive force; the ability to not care.\" We should be so lucky.\r\n\r\nThis scene had a large effect on me as a child:\r\n<blockquote><i>'Of course I don't have to do this,' one middle-aged man said, carefully cleaning the table with a damp cloth. He put the cloth in a little pouch, sat down beside him. \"But look; this table's clean.'\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He agreed that the table was clean.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Usually,' the man said. \"I work on alien -- no offence -- alien religions; Directional Emphasis In Religious Observance; that's my specialty ... like when temples or graves or prayers always have to face in a certain direction; that sort of thing? Well, I catalogue, evaluate, compare; I come up with theories and argue with colleagues, here and elsewhere. But ... the job's never finished; always new examples, and even the old ones get re-evaluated, and new people come along with new ideas about what you thought was settled ... but,' he slapped the table, \"when you clean a table you clean a table. You feel you've done something. It's an achievement.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But in the end, it's still cleaning a table.\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"And therefore does not really signify on the cosmic scale of events?' the man suggested.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe smiled in response to the man's grin, \"Well, yes.'\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n'But then what does signify? My other work? Is that really important, either?' \r\nI could try composing wonderful musical works, or day-long entertainment epics, but what would that do? Give people pleasure? My wiping this table gives me pleasure. And people come to a clean table, which gives them pleasure. And anyway\" - the man laughed - \"people die; stars die; universes die. What is any achievement, however great it was, once time itself is dead? Of course, if all I did was wipe tables, then of course it would seem a mean and despicable waste of my huge intellectual potential. But because I choose to do it, it gives me pleasure. And,\" the man said with a smile, \"it's a good way of meeting people.\"</i> \r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAs did this, before I studied formal philosophy and received a resounding confirmation of it:\r\n<blockquote><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Aw, come on; argue, dammit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n“I don’t believe in argument,” he said, looking out into the darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n“You don’t?” Erens said, genuinely surprised. “Shit, and I thought I was the cynical one.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n“It’s not cynicism,” he said flatly. “I just think people overvalue argument because they like to hear themselves talk.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n“Oh well, thank you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n“It’s comforting, I suppose.” He watched the stars wheel, like absurdly slow shells seen at night: rising, peaking, falling...(And reminded himself that the stars too would explode, perhaps, one day.) “Most people are not prepared to have their minds changed,” he said. “And I think they know in their hearts that other people are just the same, and one of the reasons people become angry when they argue is that they realize just that, as they trot out their excuses.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n“Excuses, eh?\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\"Yes, excuses,\" he said, with what Erens thought might just have been a trace of bitterness. \"I strongly suspect the things people believe in are usually just what they instinctively feel is right; the excuses, the justifications, the things you're supposed to argue about, come later. They're the least important part of the belief. That's why you can destroy them, win an argument, prove the other person wrong, and still they believe what they did in the first place.\" He looked at Erens. \"You've attacked the wrong thing.” </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nBut this was also before I got into technical pursuits which lend us hope that the above grim realism can be defeated by self-awareness, quantification, and epistemic care.

By 2086, military aid has been fully privatised, making a free market of unilateral political force:\r\n<blockquote><i>All over the world, men and women still find causes worth killing and dying for. And who are we to argue with them? Have we lived in their circumstances? Have we felt what they feel? No. It is not our place to say if they are right or wrong. At Shorn Conflict Investments, we are concerned with only two things. Will they win? And will it pay?</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nMorgan's ultra-capitalism is internally coherent, but weighed down by Chomskyan exaggeration and a clumsy <i>Mad Max</i> road-rage system in which people drive FAST and MEAN to get corporate promotion. (Awwwww shit: metaphor!!) Like many a bright-eyed anti-globaliser, Morgan overdoes it; at one point, a senior partner at Shorn erupts into a caricature inhuman plutocrat. I've added numbering to the exec's rant because it is such a dense cluster of Chomskyan muddled good intentions:\r\n<blockquote><i>Do you really think we can </i>0)<i> afford to have the developing world develop? You think we could have survived the rise of a modern, articulated Chinese superpower twenty years ago? You think we could manage an Africa full of countries run by intelligent, a) uncorrupt democrats? Or a Latin America run by men like Barranco? Just imagine it for a moment. Whole populations getting </i>1)<i> educated, and </i>2)<i> healthy, and </i>3)<i> secure, and </i>4)<i> aspirational. </i>5)<i> Women's right's, for god's sake! We can't afford these things to happen, Chris. Who's going to 6) soak up our subsidised food surplus for us? </i>7)<i> Who's going to make our shoes and shirts? </i>8)<i> Who's going to supply us with cheap labour and cheap raw materials? </i>9)<i> Who's going to buy our arms?\" </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>0) A totally false dichotomy: uncoerced trade is never zero-sum! Also, everyone has an economic interest in the economic development of the world; roughly, the richer my neighbours are, the more they can buy from me, the richer am I. <br>\r\na) Corruption is terrible for business; it subsumes about <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/cleangovbiz/49693613.pdf\">one dollar in twenty</a> <i>of the entire world's output</i>. Individually beneficial acts of bribery collectively lead to a ludicrously bad (and anti-capital!) state; \r\n<br>1) Education is good for economies, and thus good for the West (by point 0); \r\n<br>2) healthy workers are <i>very</i> good for economies; \r\n<br>3) suffering war disrupts consumer spending more than anything else (as opposed to the economics of inflicting war, admittedly, but that isn't the plutocrat's point); \r\n<br>4) (a certain limited form of) aspiration is the very heart of a consumer economy; \r\n<br>5) there were huge economic gains from feminism; \r\n<br>6) <a href=\"http://www.ictsd.org/downloads/2012/08/net-food-importing-developing-countries-who-they-are-and-policy-options-for-global-price-volatility.pdf\">this is mildly true</a>, but governmental horrors like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy#Anti-development\">CAP</a> give Morgan's rage some urgency;  \r\n<br>7) By 2086? Robots; 8) By 2086? Robots; \r\n<br>9) This one is true and horrible.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis economic naivete is balanced by his characteristic virtues: pace, cool uncliched weapons, pro-social rage (here, wifebeaters and Nazis suffer atrocities). In a rarity for SF, Morgan <i>under</i>estimates the rate of tech growth (by 2086): for instance, their drones are much larger and more limited in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqHrTtvFFIs\">application</a> than ours are already. (The book is also a good portrait of ordinary marital pain.)\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>One of his warders offered to let him have some books, but when the promised haul arrived, it consisted of a bare half-dozen battered paperbacks by authors Chris had never heard of. He picked one at random, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon\">luridly violent far-future crime novel</a> about a detective who could exchange bodies at will, but the subject matter was alien to him and his attention drifted: it all seemed very far-fetched.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nA few nice meanings in there: Morgan's apparent self-deprecation is actually bragging about his still being in print in a hundred years; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi_Kovacs\">Kovacs</a> is just this book's Faulkner character plus genetic mods; thus Faulkner finding the book \"alien\" is a serious comment on his lack of self-awareness, and explains why the loss of Carla is so fatal to his character (he can't introspect enough to prevent his fall). \r\n\r\nCrass and flashy, but psychologically ambitious. I've read everything Morgan has written despite usually disagreeing with him.\r\n",

    "review": "An attempt to make holism rigorous; given holism's deep intuitive appeal for people, the attempt is worthy. But I was hostile to this at first – mostly because her field helped breed a generation of pseuds who use ‘reductionism’ as an insult (rather than as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model\">a straightforward fact</a>, or a useful way of thinking, instances of which denote the highest achievements of the species). Let's get clear:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n “REDUCTIONISM” (to the pseud): The claim that complicated or immeasurable things do not exist.\r\n “SYSTEMS THEORY” (to the pseud): The only way of understanding things: as a whole. Everything else omits and so isn't full.\r\n \r\n REDUCTIONISM (ontology): The claim that complicated things are made of simpler things. Only the simplest of them are physically real; the rest are mental models of their interactions.*\r\n REDUCTIONISM (methodology): The attempt to isolate causes and treat phenomena in terms of their most basic units (whether quark, string, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodological_individualism\">person</a>, transaction).\r\n SYSTEMS THEORY: When things get together, they exhibit features the individual things don’t.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo stated, there is no conflict between good old reduction and shiny systems thinking. But Meadows distils the juicy bits into &lt;200pp here, and freely admits that systems theory has an intractable indeterminacy built into it, and says this, too:\r\n<blockquote> <i>Ever since the Industrial Revolution, Western society has benefited from science, logic, and reductionism over intuition and holism. Psychologically and politically we would much rather assume that the cause of a problem is “out there,” rather than “in here.” It’s almost irresistible to blame something or someone else, to shift responsibility away from ourselves, and to look for… the technical fix that will make a problem go away.\r\n\r\n Serious problems have been solved by focusing on external agents — preventing smallpox, increasing food production, moving large weights and many people rapidly over long distances. Because they are embedded in larger systems, however, some of our “solutions” have created further problems… Hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, economic instability, unemployment, chronic disease, drug addiction, and war, for example, persist in spite of the analytical ability and technical brilliance that have been directed toward eradicating them. No one deliberately creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist nonetheless.\r\n\r\n That is because they are intrinsically systems problems – undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that produce them. They will yield only as we reclaim our intuition, stop casting blame, see the system as the source of its own problems, and find the courage and wisdom to restructure it.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nCan it <i>resolve</i> empirical questions the way physics does, though? In saying, probably rightly, that a flow could go either way, depending on the state of the rest of the system and neighbouring systems, you lose or sideline <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimentum_crucis\">crucial</a> power to find out a single cause's influence, and thereby know more or less exactly what to <i>do</i> to the system. In other places, knowledge comes from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus\">isolating causes</a>. A reductionist can agree with all the clever diagrams in this, happily concede that they <i>illustrate</i> the gnarly problems of collective action and feedback and other ecosystems very clearly - and not give up their peerlessly successful method / ontological stance at all. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* Also\r\nPHYSICALISM: Everything is made of physical things. (However, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism#Strawsonian_physicalism\">the physical may be stranger than you think.</a>) </blockquote>",

Nearer us in time and space than his Kovacs novels (this isn’t interstellar) – but they’ve still all forgotten us, bar the historians. Morgan lets genetic determinism run away with the plot: everyone’s always explaining themselves with reference to their or others’ “wiring”. At one point the protagonist hears a similarity in two people’s diction and “wondered idly what genes the two men might share”. Also his theme, ‘GM humans as future Other’ gets ponderous inbetween the ultraviolence. But Morgan is always worthwhile: his books suspend the ideological alongside the unhappily sexual alongside big strange guns (e.g. an AIDS pistol, loaded with GM virus ‘Falwell’). More mature in some ways – there’s a feminist imam, and a religious character he doesn’t have violent contempt for – but also a bit busy and contralto. \r\n\r\nStross and Morgan refer to ‘black labs’ a lot – that is, dastardly underground geneticists. Every single time they did, I wondered what the authors had against Labradors. Sort it out.\r\n",

It does have a right good baddie - a calm galactic overlord driven to be demonic and obscene for PR reasons. But the protagonist, a thoughtful manipulated academic, isn't interesting.

    "review": "A leftist defence of marriage and a postmodern attempt at making love a big deal, ontologically speaking; beyond this initial frisson of meta-contrarian goodness, though: meh. Book's a bite-sized transcription of a formal literary talk - a genre which may well have no good instance. Here's the solitary pair of beautiful moments in an otherwise lukewarm bath of the history of philosophy of love and lazy sub-systematic Lacanian guesswork*:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>While desire focuses on the other, always in a somewhat fetishist[ic] manner, on particular objects, like breasts, buttocks and cock, love focuses on the very being of the other, on the other as it has erupted, fully armed with its being, into my life that is consequently disrupted and re-fashioned.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Love is an existential project: to construct a decentred world, from a point of view other than that of my mere impulse to survive and re-affirm my own identity... When I lean on the shoulder of the woman I love, and can see, let’s say, the peace of a twilight over a mountain landscape, gold-green fields, the shadows of trees, black-nosed sheep motionless behind hedges and sun about to disappear behind craggy peaks, and know — not from the expression on her face, but from within the world as it is — that she is seeing the same world, and that this convergence is part of the world; that love constitutes precisely, at that very moment, the paradox of an </i>identical<i> difference, then love exists, and promises to continue existing. The fact is she and I are now incorporated into this unique subject, the subject of love that views the panorama of the world through the prism of our difference, so this world can be conceived, be born, and not simply represent what fills my own individual gaze. Love is always the possibility of being present at the birth of the world.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nClearer prose than you'd expect, though, isn't it?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* e.g. laziness: his claim about there being four \"conditions\" of philosophy, none of which are in fact <i>necessary</i> conditions, and one of which is good old dyadic love:\r\n <blockquote><i>Anyone who doesn't take love as their starting-point will never discover what philosophy is about.</i></blockquote>\r\n(Never mind, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070901095011/http://www.neurological.org.nz/html/article.php?documentCode=26\">Cavendish</a>; oh well <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#Personal_relations\">Newton</a>, sorry Schopenhauer; you tried real hard.)\r\n</blockquote>",

    "review": "Odd anti-rationalist fantasy on the model of TH White. (What’s the word for the pre-Tolkien, pre-swords-and-sorcery model of fantasy?) Everything is oblique, from the discussion of Auschwitz at the start, to the Kafkan bureaucracy seated in a pastoral landscape. I admire his portrayal of the totalitarian Administrators: when defeated, they are not destroyed but put in their place. There are also passages like this:\r\n<blockquote><i>…to achieve the blessed intention, something practical had to be done. Things could not be left in the hands of the Administrators. In the story of man, that had been tried times without number and always it had failed. (The revolving Earth, pitted with its tragedies, cried in a far voice from the midst of space: ‘You cannot leave me to politicians.’)\r\n\r\nBut administrators are needful, are necessary. To fulfil their high function they work with the cunning of the head. But to leave destiny to the head is to leave the trigger to the finger. And after the trigger is pulled they cry above the desolation – (and the desolation was terrible to behold): ‘We will make a new earth, and share the fruits thereof and the fishes of the deeps.’ But what happens?\r\n\r\nThe fruit is processed and the salmon is canned.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nA good children’s book: pure of heart and finely weighted. But too didactic for me.",

(Note, however, that this isn't really a book: it's a transcript of Chomsky in discussion with someone with even less ideological care than he. Also, the title is cool but misleading, since they don't actually go in to the plausible claim that the West's foreign policy has been terroristic, and since I don't think drones come up at all.) It is selective as history and nearly worthless as economics, but I do not begrudge Chomsky continuing his fifty-year marathon of talking about covert realpolitik: these sorts of manipulations are almost unreported at the time, go wholly unpunished, and are rapidly forgotten. \r\n\r\nLike what? Well, begin with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State#Humanitarian_disaster\">Leopold II</a>, skip to the Enola Gay, or Britain's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine_(legal_instrument)\">Palestine</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat\">Operation Boot</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_PBFORTUNE\">Operation PBFORTUNE</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba#Foreign_involvement_in_his_death\">Lumumba</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/laos/1478626/History-haunts-the-Plain-of-Jars.html\">Plain of Jars</a>, and the long systematic atrocity \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor#U.S._involvement\">Operation Condor</a>\" (involving us and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinochet#U.S._backing_of_the_coup\">Pinochet</a>, Noriega and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama\">Just Cause</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/28/indonesia.world\">Suharto</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War#United_States_involvement\">El Salvador</a>), or that Iraq matter.<br /><br />\r\nBut even though it handles these real crimes, <i>On Western Terrorism</i> turns out to be an echo-chamber - a mix of apparently detailed research (e.g. they appeal to some 'declassified embassy reports' to back up some claims) and pervasive confirmation bias. \r\n\r\nThe main problem's exaggeration. In one breath they move from a righteous skit on the original colonial genocides to a view of world politics in which <i>everything</i> that happens now is the outcome of decisions in Brussels and Washington. From “The West has, historically and recently, been hypocritically violent and anti-democratic” to “Everything bad in the world is due to the West”. That sounds like a sure straw man, but here’s the man himself:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>The great majority of events that were causing the suffering of countless human beings all over the world were related to greed, to the desire to rule and to control coming almost exclusively from the ‘old continent’ and its powerful but ruthless offspring on the other shore.</i></blockquote> (Oh? malaria? dysentery? precarious subsistence farming? Hutu-on-Tutsi genocide?) He’s at it again here: \r\n<blockquote><i>although it is mostly Rwanda, Uganda who are murdering millions of innocent [Congolese] people, behind this are always Western geopolitical and economic interests.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell. It's true that, as well as the flat-out murders in the links above, our governments bear shame for ignoring <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_war\">unbelievably destructive</a> ongoing wars in e.g. the Congo. But failing to prevent murder is not murder, nor necessarily accessory to - especially if we remember that C&V’s judicious attitude to military intervention would have precluded direct action anyway. There is a logical chasm between what one could only <i>perhaps</i> prevent - given enough luck and blood - and what one is the cause of. (I agree that the two situations place similar responsibilities on us, by the way - but in the absence of simple solutions, that hypothetical responsibility does not make them the same.) Similarly: capitalism produces enormous inequality but <a href=\"http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2011$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=0AkBd6lyS3EmpdHo5S0J6ekhVOF9QaVhod05QSGV4T3c;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL%5Fn5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=194;dataMax=96846$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=55;dataMax=108111$map_s;sma=50;smi=2$cd;bd=0$inds=\">mostly inadvertently relieves poverty</a>: poverty is our default from before there <i>was</i> a world-system. But C&V and others of the demagogic school persist in blaming all the world's ills on rich bores whose uncaring exploitation often works better for the poor than altruistic direct action. (This is very counterintuitive; so much for intuition.)\r\n\r\nWhy do I disagree? They say it’s cos I’m a dupe: \r\n<blockquote><i>There have been very sophisticated propaganda systems developed in the last hundred years and they colonized minds including the minds of the perpetrators. That’s why the intellectual classes in the West generally can’t see it.</i></blockquote> \r\nI say it’s because while their description of our foreign policy is (depressingly) fair, on the foreign policy of rival governments they are uncritical, whitewashing, and on historical alternatives to our type of society they are naive and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking_(fallacy)\">cherry-picking</a>, where they give evidence at all. What might a real radical say in response to my aspersions? \"Fuck balance! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGArqoF0TpQ\">Balance</a> is what lets them get away with it! Fuck evidence! Evidence is what makes people think I’m wrong!\" \r\n\r\nVltchek is much more skewed than Chomsky. He’s earnest, and clearly devoted to <a href=\"http://andrevltchek.weebly.com/films.html\">first-hand reporting</a> of the abuse of powerless people. But, oddly, depressingly, this immersion in the frontline has robbed him of perspective (and in fact it doesn't get more front-line: he was tortured in East Timor in 1996). He suffers the defining mistake of recent leftism: the enemy of my enemy error, where  you'll approve of anyone who resists the West. In fact, his comments, taken over the whole book, amount to a flirting defence of totalitarianism - he romanticises the Soviets, Assad's Syria, and <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/world-report-%5Bscheduler-publish-yyyy%5D/world-report-2014-ecuador\">Ecuador</a>. Both of them exchange the Eurocentric rose-tint of our mainstream for lenses warped in the reverse direction. And it all rests, ultimately, on tacit belief in the <a href=\"http://tomtalkspolitics.wordpress.com/2009/12/07/bertrand-russells-the-superior-virtue-of-the-oppressed/\">'superior virtue of the oppressed</a>' - the strange belief that being bombed makes the bomb recipient better than you. (Sure, they’re probably more virtuous than the bombers, but that’s not saying much.) Our governments being awful does not mean that others are not. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization\">Quite the reverse</a>.\r\n\r\nAlso: Chomsky bashes the 'Black Book' of Communism not by challenging its accounting, but by saying that Western capitalism's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque\">toll was worse</a> (no footnote, but see the lone India example below); and the Prague Spring is utterly minimised with the same ugly break-a-few-eggs fallacy. Vltchek: \r\n<blockquote><i>Moscow’s invasion of 1968 to put down the Prague Spring was not necessarily something that should have happened... but there was no massacre performed by the Soviets; few people fell under the tanks. Most of what happened was accidents; some people who died were drunk.</i> </blockquote>\r\n(The direct death toll was 72 plus suicides, if that's what he means.) \r\n\r\nThat’s the first big problem. The other huge one is the <i>complete</i> lack of footnotes, even as they make the boldest possible claims. As a result, even I identified some errors in the course of my single superficial reading. (Ok, so some failings are just the vagaries of live dialogue as compared to writing; but Vltchek (or Pluto Press at least) would be forgiven for editing the damn thing for basic evidence.)\r\n\r\nThe only research cited in support of the claim that capitalism causes more excess death from starvation is Dreze and Sen's reputable 1981 study 'Hunger and Public Action (<a href=\"http://www.polsci.ucsb.edu/faculty/glasgow/ps15/DrezeSen.pdf\">p.214 here</a>). C&V use this to compare excess deaths in India (as an instance of a market democracy) in 1947-1979 with that of Communist China, pointing out that Dreze and Sen place the toll in India at some <i>100</i> million, next to China’s '25-30' million. (First cockup: citing thirty-year-old research underestimates the toll of Mao’s famine by perhaps <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao's_Great_Famine#Criticism\">20m people</a>.) But the comparison doesn't do the work they put it to (that is, condemning capitalism): India was almost an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarkic\">autarkic</a> <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS022.pdf&rct=j&frm=1&q=&esrc=s&sa=U&ei=CjO8U875JIjsOoKzgMAB&ved=0CBQQFjAA&sig2=jPPsJmQt057fqArKrMJ3kg&usg=AFQjCNGPlxtds0U9r_FEXHEoKaHEaeiSuA\">command economy</a> (in which perhaps two-thirds of all formal, non-subsistence employment was public-sector) in that period; it does not serve them as an exemplar of neoliberal starvation. \r\n\r\nEven if it did, we would again come up against their curious equation of <i>failure to prevent an intractable thing</i> with causing the thing in the first place. As far as I can tell, their reasoning really is: “Capitalism exists, and poverty exists, so, capitalism causes poverty.” But it would take one of two things for capitalism to be responsible for poverty: causation, as evidenced by e.g. <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/06/economist-explains-0\">a gross increase</a> in the number of poor people under its penumbra; or its impeding a more effective solution to poverty. But the proportion of (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty#Absolute_poverty\">utterly</a>) poor people, in this supremely Late-capitalist world is the lowest it has ever been; and the remaining poverty is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_Billion\">not at all simple to fix</a>; and capitalist countries really did try, throwing <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/01/23/aid_amnesia\">enormous amounts of money and thought</a> at the problem for going-on 70 years. \r\n\r\nTo be responsible for poverty in the way C&V say, either capitalism or old socialism would have to be omnipotent, and - among other fairly strong disconfirmations for that idea - the 20th century shows both of those to be untrue. (The <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Chomsky-book-a-best-seller-after-Chavez-speech-2469244.php\">commercial success</a> of Chomsky in his enormously capitalist society, is an extra data point toward rubbishing any strong statement about capitalism's mind-control powers.)\r\n\r\n(Vltchek talks about global warming briefly, and I was about to reach for the <a href=\"http://www.rtcc.org/2012/03/12/kiribati-president-rejects-climate-change-evacuation-stories/\">recent debunking</a> of claims of Polynesian evacuation – but in fact it turns out his sources were better; the president of Kiribati has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/01/kiribati-climate-change-fiji-vanua-levu\">since publicly floated</a> a national evac plan.)\r\n\r\nA less straightforward quibble: they think this book is about the West, I think it’s about humans with power.\r\n\r\nI had believed Chomsky more humane than this talk makes him seem (see for example his <a href=\"http://www.spectrezine.org/global/chomsky.htm\">sombre 90s piece</a> on the Black Book) - that is, I want to pin the blame for this biased and maudlin tract on Vltchek. But <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2012/05/21/see-no-evil/\">his long-standing dismissal</a> of some non-Western massacres at last makes me wonder.\r\n\r\nOn a less uninspired and dispiriting note: if there is a system less bad than Swedish capitalism, it does not exist in the past. So it must be invented, negotiated, and tested. Chomsky and the other socially enraged <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostalgie\">ostalgiacs</a> in his ambit are not mostly doing that; <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2013/03/22/on-erik-olin-wrights-envisioning-real-utopias-diane-coyle/\">Erik Olin Wright</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/a-practical-utopians-guide-to-the-coming-collapse\">David Graber</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/feminism-capitalist-handmaiden-neoliberal\">Nancy Fraser</a> and others are at least trying.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nFinally, what’s so bad about being excessive and dogmatic in your criticism of awful things? (Why should anti-oppression efforts need to justify themselves? They're anti-oppression!) Well, apart from it being dangerous and ignoble to be so firmly wrong, taking this tack means that your true conclusions will be dismissed as just more of your typical excesses. \r\n\r\nBut even given their slips, hyperbole, and complacency, there’s no way around <i>some</i> of C&V's key claims: Our governments have not in general been a positive force in the rest of the world; this is not well-known within our societies; as long as <a href=\"https://www.globalpolicy.org/us-un-and-international-law-8-24/us-opposition-to-the-icc-8-29.html\">the US is</a> <a href=\"http://www.globalissues.org/article/490/united-states-and-the-icc\">legally immune</a> from prosecution, international justice is a joke; we have often given money and guns to the worst people in the world; we did this for little more than control and for stuff.

    "review": "Comic novella about raping famous men for money. So, one of the first <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction#Timeline\">real person slashfics</a> in history. Actually scandalous; one can only imagine the ruckus if it was published today.\r\n\r\nThe eponymous rogue teams up with a livestock scientist and a beautiful accomplice (\"<i>Yasmin Howcomely, a girl absolutely soaked in sex</i>\") to date-rape the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Uncle_Oswald#Victims_of_Oswald.27s_plot_.28in_order_of_appearance_in_the_book.29\">great men</a> of early C20th Europe. Then blackmail them, and steal their semen to sell off. Drugging Freud, Monet and Proust with a psychotic aphrodisiac, the three conspirators collect a Nobel sperm bank. Most of the men are disposed of in one pithy paragraph, with only comic details supplied. \r\n\r\nIt's scandalous because of its levity. The plot has more in common with <em>A Serbian Film </em>than <em>Carry On</em>, yet it keeps up the latter's matey banter. At one point Yasmin comes across Picasso, who promptly rapes and dismisses her, without need of the \"Sudanese blister beetle\" drug. Needless to say, this is tremendous sport:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Do you know what he did afterwards?\" Yasmin said. \"He just buttoned up his trousers and said, ‘Thank you, mademoiselle. That was very refreshing. Now I must get back to my work.’ And he turned away, Oswald! He just turned away and started painting again!\"\r\n\"He’s Spanish,\" I said, \"like Alfonso.\" I stepped out of the car and cranked the starting handle and when I got back in again, Yasmin was tidying her hair in the car mirror. \r\n\"I hate to say it,” she said, \"but I rather enjoyed that one.\"\r\n\"Tell me,\" I said, \"is Monsieur Picasso a genius?\"\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"it was very strong. He shall be wildly famous one day.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThe sexual prowess of the drugged men is a means for Oswald to reflect on their overall quality. (The volume they produce is shorthand for his esteem of them, e.g.: \"<i>Fifty straws from Kipling.</i>\") It leaves Dahl room to propound a general ranking of the giant personalities of the eC20th. For instance, Einstein and Freud are able to resist their inverted rape for some minutes, earning both respect and suspicion. And of Freud:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"You should have seen his face, Oswald. You really should have seen it. The Beetle was hitting him and the sexcrazy glint was coming into h</span></span><span style=\"color: #783f04; font-family: inherit;\">is eyes and he was beginning to flap his arms like an old crow. But I’ll say this for him. He didn’t jump me right away. He held off for at least a minute or so while he tried to analyze what the hell was happening. He looked down at his trousers. Then he looked up at me... He was really very decent about it all. As soon as he’d had his first explosion... he jumped away and ran back to his desk stark naked and began writing notes. He must be terrifically strong-minded. Great intellectual curiosity.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThe low point comes in the treatment of Shaw, by this stage a celibate disabled old man. They drug him three times the dose and:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Who is there?\" shouted a voice from behind the hut. It was a male voice, but high-pitched and almost squeaky. Oh God, I though, the man is a eunuch after all...\r\n\r\n[after]... I heard a yell from the garden and in the half-darkness I saw this tall, ghostlike, whitebearded figure charging down upon us stark naked and yelling, \"Come back, you strumpet! I haven’t finished with you yet!\"\r\n\r\nI saw Mr. Shaw capering about on the sidewalk under the gaslight, white-skinned all over save for a pair of socks on his feet, bearded above and bearded below as well, with his massive pink member protruding like a sawn-off shotgun from the lower beard. It was a sight I shall not readily forget, this mighty and supercilious playwright who had always mocked the passions of the flesh, himself impaled now upon the sword of lust</span>...\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nHe is made into a real man - no more humourless vegetarian prude. Sad and standard in \"one of [Dahl's] lightest comic works\".\r\n\r\nOswald is not Dahl; some of Oswald's opinions of his victims are cartoonishly snobbish; its <a href=\"https://readysteadyno.blogspot.com/2010/02/propos-of-lady-chatterleys-lover-dh.html\">idiotic, Lawrentian theory</a> of virility is only used because it is very funny; and Oswald receives a brutal comeuppance for exploiting Yasmin that it's implied he never recovers from. \r\n\r\nA dazzling and ridiculous book, and as far as I can tell it evaded all opprobrium because it was published in the gap between the sexual revolution and the rise of PC. From the above you already know if you should avoid it.",

(Redundancies: he splits illusion of control and action bias, the paradox of choice and decision fatigue...) Consider the ‘It’s-gotta-get-worse-before-it-gets-better effect’. \r\n\r\nThe big problem for the heuristics and biases program is when you get contradictory pairs of biases – how can people be both ? The actual researchers have done well in synthesising these and providing base-rates for effect sizes (without which, the programme is little more than a new way for intellectuals to insult each other). Dobelli offers no classification, effect sizes, or even citations (they’re hidden online), just clomping informational candy. \r\n\r\nTaleb for dummies.

This probably makes it a brilliant picture of the era's background of vast fear, but that doesn't make for a good read. The three characters are just scared, and though their hardships are harsh indeed, they're oddly unaffecting. The political economy that drove them out there is completely absent, only represented by sketched armed thugs. Nor is the world-justifying love of the central couple convincing, either. So it's tragic, but in no meaningful or honourable way. \r\n\r\nThe prose does sometimes have a lovely Doric lilt - \"<i>We were but young in stealth. As we drove along the Spey, the silent night was full of ears that harkened to our passing. It was midnight when our second journey ended, and dark, dark</i>.\" \r\n- and local loons will get a kick out of it. \r\n",

    "review": "Pleasant, mostly fabricated historical novel about an obscure Estonian nobleman who sent his friend Czar Alexander a draft constitution which ended the absolute monarchy, and inherited titles, and removed the Czar from military command, and gave out universal education and the franchise, and who got what you'd expect in return. All the events come to us filtered through a ignoble narrator representing the standard 'enlightened' view of the time: <i>sure the Romanovs are evil, but for God's sake don't say so</i>. \r\n\r\nLots to admire, in the slow, tense pace - nothing really happens in the present, it's all uncovered in letters - or in his handling of Timo's idealism/insanity. This prison scene made me laugh, on the tube:\r\n<blockquote><i>'Timo - are you really sure it was the Czar?'\r\n\"I wasn't sure at first. He was wearing a short black cloak with a hood covering his head. I couldn't open my eyes and look straight at him, because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Then I recognized him with certainty, in the light... he stepped back from my cot, and – just imagine this! – knelt down on the floor that was covered with rat droppings – I watched him through my eyelashes – and began to pray – two feet away from my ear! I could hear every word he whispered: \r\n\r\n'... I beseech Thee, Lord, make him see reason and make him apologize to his Sovereign for his unimaginable words — so that I might forgive him and become free of the burden it is to me to keep him im­prisoned...’ He closed his eyes and said, as if to himself: ‘But if Thou hast decided otherwise, I say like Thy son said to Thee at Gethsemane: Father, I pray to Thee — but let Thy will be done, not mine. ’ And then, Jakob — then he lowered his head and opened his eyes, and looked straight into mine...\r\n“Well. Two words was all we exchanged. He whispered:\r\n'...Timothee?!'\r\nAnd I said, '</i>Tartuffe!<i>'\r\n\r\n“He covered his ears with his palms and ran out of the casemate, in rather an unimperial fashion. And I haven’t seen him since.” Timo cleared his throat and added, sounding somewhat self-deprecating: “At least not awake, that is...”\r\nI said, “Timo, this story — surely it was only a dream?”\r\nTimo had walked over to the far corner of the room where the\r\nshadows cast by the sconce mirrors combined to create near­\r\ndarkness. He stood there, almost invisible; even the glow of the\r\npipe he was holding had gone out. Then he laughed and said: \r\n“Well — whatever you think best... ”\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nBut Kross is clumsy in inserting an enchanting peasant as Timo's wife; everyone who knows her is a complete Eeva fanboy, rhapsodising. But it's not clear why; she's brave and catty but otherwise pretty indistinct. There's definitely an undercurrent of promoting Estonian accomplishments here - not many of Timo and Eeva's grand and broad virtues are attested in the evidence, which makes them <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue\">Mary</a> and <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu\">Marty</a> Sue in Kross' fanfiction - but it strikes me that this is not just chauvinism, given Kross' context. Consider: an Estonian living under Russian totalitarianism writes about an Estonian speaking out against Russian totalitarianism.\r\n\r\nI resent Kross for the M. Night Shymalan ending, a bit, though it is possible that I should be resenting the narrator's fantasies of it instead.",

For an academic, his prose is highly flavoursome and fun. He has a considered opinion about Darwin's handwriting and the meaning of baseball. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_for_Brontosaurus\">One</a> of his essay collections was very important to me as a teen, showing me that I could unify truth-seeking and justice-seeking, and with style. \r\n\r\nBut this is all countermanded, because he is just <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/kv/beware_of_stephen_j_gould/\">not trustworthy</a> <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_earthling/1996/11/homo_deceptus.html\">on human</a> <a href=\"http://www.umsl.edu/~carrolljc/Documents%20linked%20to%20indiex/IN_LIT_DAR/Critique_of_Gould.pdf\">topics</a>, and <a href=\"http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/CEP_Gould.html\">neither on</a> core evolutionary theory, I'm told. From his enormously influential, fallacious dismissal of intelligence research in general and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/science/14skull.html?_r=1\">Morton in particular</a>, to his dishonest coup of public discourse over punctuated equilibrium (pushing the flashy and revolutionary version in literary magazines, retreating to minimal and uncontentious forms in the science journals who could actually evaluate it), he muddied the waters even as he brandished real literary talent and noble political intentions. This is unforgiveable: empirical clarity is too rare and precious to sacrifice so. \r\n\r\nMaynard Smith: <i><blockquote>Gould occupies a rather curious position, particularly on his side of the Atlantic. Because of the excellence of his essays, he has come to be seen by non-biologists as the preeminent evolutionary theorist. In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists. All this would not matter, were it not that he is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory.</i></blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/evolute.html\">Krugman</a>:\r\n<i><blockquote>Gould is the John Kenneth Galbraith of his subject. That is, he is a wonderful writer who is beloved by literary intellectuals and lionized by the media because he does not use algebra or difficult jargon. Unfortunately, it appears that he avoids these sins not because he has transcended his colleagues but because he does does not seem to understand what they have to say; and his own descriptions of what the field is about - not just the answers, but even the questions - are consistently misleading. His impressive literary and historical erudition makes his work seem profound to most readers, but informed readers eventually conclude that there's no there there.</i></blockquote>\r\nTooby and Cosmides:\r\n<i><blockquote>We suggest that the best way to grasp the nature of Gould's writings is to recognize them as one of the most formidable bodies of fiction to be produced in recent American letters. Gould brilliantly works a number of literary devices to construct a fictional \"Gould\" as the protagonist of his essays and to construct a world of \"evolutionary biology\" every bit as imaginary and plausible as Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. Most of the elements of Gould's writing make no sense if they are interpreted as an honest attempt to communicate about science (e.g., why would he characterize so many researchers as saying the opposite of what they actually do) but come sharply into focus when understood as necessary components of a world constructed for the fictional \"Gould\" to have heroic fantasy adventures in...\r\n\r\n \"Gould\" the protagonist is a much loved character who reveals himself to be learned, subtle, open-minded, tolerant, funny, gracious to his opponents, a tireless adversary of cultural prejudice, able to swim upstream against popular opinion with unflinching moral courage, able to pierce the surface appearances that capture others, and indeed to be not only the most brilliant innovator in biology since Darwin, but more importantly to be the voice of humane reason against the forces of ignorance, passion, incuriousity, and injustice. The author Gould, not least because he labors to beguile his audience into confusing his fictional targets with actual people and fields, is sadly none of these things.\r\n\r\nYet in the final analysis, there are genuine grounds for hope in the immense and enduring popularity of Gould. Gould is popular, we think, because readers see in \"Gould\" the embodiment of humane reason, the best aspirations of the scientific impulse. It is this \"Gould\" that we will continue to honor, and, who, indeed, would fight to bring the illumination that modern evolutionary science can offer into wider use. </i></blockquote>\r\nHere is a fictional leaf from Gould's <i>ad hominem</i> book, to give you a sense of what he does, at his worst:\r\n<blockquote><i>Gould is famed for the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which holds that adaption and speciation is not generally a slow, gradual process measurable in tens of thousands of year periods, but instead a rapid response to environmental shocks, measurable in hundred-year periods. The political bias of this theory is too blatant to ignore: as a Marxist, Gould requires that sustainable change be possible by revolution rather than by long accumulation (...)</i></blockquote>\r\n(For full effect I should now chide him for his genic panadaptationism.)\r\n\r\nAlong with Lewontin and Rose, Gould mediated a huge contradiction in our culture: they allowed the C20th left to feel we were scientific, in our comfortable blank-slatism. That we had already incorporated the deep challenge of evolutionary biology - since these eminent men told us it had no human implications. \r\n\r\nRead Gould for fun and uplift, but take great care, for he cares about other things more than truth. (Read Midgley and Singer first if the politics scare you; they might stop you fleeing into Gould's dodgy arms.)\r\n\r\nFrom James. The Leonardo and Columbus esays are 4/5.</li>\r\n",

    "review": "Wonderful. About two boys who are not boys, mostly because they don't want to be. They are only 16 but already have the skill and stoicism which actually constitute adulthood, rather than mere age. It is also about law and morals and power and the chasms between these things. Also suddenly, bizarrely, about pre- and post-revolutionary Mexico. \r\n<blockquote><i>They were zacateros headed into the mountains to gather chino grass. If they were surprised to see Americans horseback in that country they gave no sign... They themselves were a rough lot, dressed half in rags, their hats marbled with grease and sweat, their boots mended with raw cowhide... They looked out over the terrain as if it were a problem to them. Something they'd not quite decided about.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>They pulled the wet saddles off the horses and hobbled them and walked off in separate directions through the chaparral to stand spraddlelegged clutching their knees and vomiting. The browsing horses jerked their heads up. It was no sound they'd ever heard before... something imperfect and malformed lodged in the heart of being. A thing smirking deep in the eyes of grace itself like a gorgon in an autumn pool.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>The country rolled away to the west through broken light and shadow and the distant summer storms a hundred miles downcountry to where the cordilleras rose and sank in the haze in a frail last shimmering restraint alike of the earth and the eye beholding it. </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Finally he said that among men there was no such communion as among horses and the notion that men can be understood at all was probably an illusion.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nI remain amazed by McCarthy's ability to use the most hollow and worn-out tropes - horse whispering, the stableboy and <i>heredera</i>, cowboys and varmints, injustice and redemption, the climactic shootout - and make them new, blasting through your cynicism with sheer force of prose. It's a dark book, but I laughed a lot, mostly at the boys' philosophising, which natural creasing I recognise from most boys I have known, educated or not.\r\n<blockquote><i>My daddy run off from home when he was fifteen. Otherwise I'd of been born in Alabama. \r\nYou wouldn't of been born at all. \r\nWhat makes you say that? \r\nCause your mama's from San Angelo and he never would of met her. \r\nHe'd of met somebody. \r\nSo would she. So? \r\nSo you wouldn't of been born.\r\nI dont see why you say that. I'd of been born somewheres.\r\nHow? \r\nWell why not? \r\nIf your mama had a baby with her other husband and your daddy had one with his other wife which one would you be? \r\nI wouldn't be neither of em. \r\nThat's right.\r\nRawlins lay watching the stars. After a while he said: I could still be born. I might look different or somethin. \r\n If God wanted me to be born I'd be born. \r\nAnd if He didnt you wouldnt. \r\nYou're makin my goddamn head hurt. \r\nI know it. I'm makin my own hurt.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou ever get ill at ease? said Rawlins.\r\nAbout what?\r\nI dont know. About anything. Just ill at ease.\r\nSometimes. If you're someplace you aint supposed to be I guess you'd be ill at ease. Should be anyways.\r\nWell suppose you were ill at ease and didnt know why. Would that mean that you might be someplace you wasnt supposed to be and didnt know it?</blockquote></i>\r\nYou are disoriented when John goes home, to 1950s Texas; the rest of the novel operates with early nineteenth century logic and props. You wake up from a long nightmare into the modern dreamtime.\r\n\r\n",

    "review": "Balanced coverage of the great monster, including his meteoric rise from penniless immigrant German Jew to a permanent spot in the highest caste of global influence; his academic conceit (the longest-ever thesis at Harvard), and his ceaseless inveigling and brown-nosing. (In case you don't know, Kissinger is probably the greatest war criminal in American history.) Res ipsa loquitur:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Whenever peace — conceived as the avoidance of war — has been the primary objective of a power or a group of powers, the international system has been at the mercy of the most ruthless member of the international community. [A more proper goal is] stability based on an equilibrium of forces.\r\n\r\nIf I had to choose between justice and disorder, on the one hand, and injustice and order, on the other, I would always choose the latter.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere's not a lot of editorial from Isaacson. He respects Kissinger's single-mindedness and intellectual clout, while giving us plenty of his egotism and blandly evil wonkishness:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nHere was an example of what would become a pattern in Kissinger’s diplomacy: his attempt to mediate a dispute by finding a semantic formulation to finesse differences. In this case it was devising a phrase that linked the bombing halt to the negotiations, without sounding like a condition. Later, at the end of the war, he would search for ambiguous phrases about the demilitarized zone and South Vietnamese sovereignty that could be read differently in Hanoi and Saigon. Sometimes these word games paid off. But usually they opened Kissinger up to accusations that he had left important disagreements unresolved by talking out of both sides of his mouth.\r\n\r\n[during the 1970 election, R v N ] At the convention, the Rockefeller forces, with little to lose, sent Kissinger to talk to the Iowa delegation. “It was so novel to me,” he told a reporter at the time. “I’d never met working politicians before. I didn’t attempt to talk their language. I just talked what I knew.” The Iowa delegation voted overwhelmingly for Nixon.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIsaacson soft-pedals the mass chaos and death Kissinger gave rise to. And much more has come to light about Kissinger's <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/opinion/sunday/nixons-vietnam-treachery.html?_r=0\">personal</a> <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/henry-kissinger-hillary-clintons-tutor-in-war-and-peace/\">responsibility</a> for it, since Isaacson published this. \r\n\r\nDr Strangelove wasn't based on Kissinger, but I find it impossible not to think of Peter Sellars (or Woody Allen) when reading about the tragic success of this erotomaniacal egomaniac.\r\n\r\nHitchens' <i>Trial of Henry Kissinger</i> is much more salient.\r\n",

Their incredible polytheistic babel of religions... their cooking, their manners, their bastard architecture and sickly arts... and their blind, pathetic, arrogant beleief in their superiority.

    "review": "<blockquote><i> The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better [to] rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes</i></blockquote>– Frank Herbert\r\n<blockquote><i>'Didn't you learn the difference between Harkonnen and Atreides so that you could smell a Harkonnen trick by the stink they left on it. Didn't you learn that Atreides loyalty is bought with love, while the Harkonnen coin is hate?</i></blockquote>– also Frank Herbert\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Dune</i> shouldn't work: there's a lot of the worst of fantasy fiction in it. The spurious black and white morality, above; cod-medieval dialogue; noble-savagery and bizarro Orientalism; its spoilers for itself (through its constant first-person precognition); and the po-faced chapter epigrams about how great the main character is... <a href=\"#lol\">*</a>\r\n\r\nBut it does work. It works because of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrakis\">the loveable setting</a> and its thrilling ecosystem; the sharp, rapid dialogue; its sheer, smushy pastiche of human history (American environmentalism, medieval feudalism, Arabic sheikism, and Zen martial hokum (\"<i>he is a Zensunni prophet</i>\", \"<i>to use the family atomics</i>\"); its mystical anti-<i>Star Trek</i> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism\">historical materialism</a>; excellent setpieces; and because the book contains a realist reading of its own magical-heroic events. (Here's a start: Everything takes place on a world made of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melange_(fictional_drug)\">shroom heroin</a>! You can't trust a thing these people say!)\r\n\r\nThis hidden realism is clearest in the (heavy) appendices to the book - these aren't the ordinary conceited footnotes of fantasy, which assume you care about its little world as much as the author does. They're instead a rationalist palate cleanser after 600 pages of woo. A scientific, academic register erupts, mocking the internally real mysticism of the foregoing. I was even a little disappointed to find a huge <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Dune_terminology\">glossary</a> at the end, containing all the words I had been puzzling over. Mystery and gnosis and not-quite-getting-it suits the plot. The appendices say the book is more than its plot, and the world more than its books.\r\n\r\n(The big realist moment within the book is when you see that the great prophecy is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene_Gesserit#Missionaria_Protectiva\">just a scam</a>, planted to manipulate people.)\r\n\r\nThe baddies, the Harkonnens, are a bit much though: nothing they do is not repulsive. Herbert has the protagonists use mysticism and authoritarianism, while having most of the best characters resist and despise these things. There's no such tension with the main antagonists, no nominally redeeming feature. So you can feel Herbert hissing and booing the Harkonnens. Here is the <i>first</i> scene with the evil Baron:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    It was a relief globe of a world, partly in shadows, spinning under the impetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings... A chuckle sounded beside the globe. A basso voice rumbled out of the chuckle:<br> 'There it is, Piter, the biggest mantrap in all history. And the Duke's headed into its jaws. Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?'\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nHerbert gets away with this because Harkonnen is supposed to be over-the-top, and, more, because his world has a <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality\">black and grey</a> morality. (Do you want the genocidal decadent rapist Machiavels or the square-chinned aristocratic Machiavels?)\r\n\r\nThe greyness of the Atreides leads to the biggest plot problem. (It's not exactly a plot hole, but it takes interpretive labour to make it make sense.): Paul's Jihad is unmotivated. Nobody wants it, including the Messiah it is carried out for. Paul even compares himself to Mega Hitler:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n'There's another emperor I want you to note in passing - a Hitler. He killed more than six million. Pretty good for those days.'\r\n'Killed by his legions?'\r\n'Yes.'\r\n'Not very impressive statistics, m'Lord.'\r\n'... at a conservative estimate, I've killed sixty-one billion, sterilised ninety planets... We'll be a hundred generations recovering from Muad'dib's jihad.'\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nand it's implied that the previous tyrant, Padishah, did not do such things. This completely undermines the exciting and righteous revolution that we spent a book and a half cheering on. If unprecedented death and misery is the payoff, <i>what is the gain of having a noble ruler</i>?\r\n\r\nOK, Paul frequently speaks of not being able to stop the jihad - scrying that, if he does try and stop it, he just gets usurped and then it carries on worse. But then he shouldn't have come to power at all, and the book tacitly tells us that things would have been better if the Harkonnens succeeded and none of the last three-quarters happened.\r\n\r\nThe way to make sense of this is to take Herbert's anti-hero line above seriously. Paul made a terrible situation worse. We're not supposed to root for him. But, Herbert knows, we can't help it, because Paul is the Underdog and Loyal and Smart and Competent and (obvs) dead handsome.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-by8JNAIBYhc/WbW0uIcZgLI/AAAAAAAADH8/vcPFGJ3vvt8j71isQG8UfGtY59Gr4uX9gCLcBGAs/s1600/spice.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img data-original-height=\"470\" data-original-width=\"500\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-by8JNAIBYhc/WbW0uIcZgLI/AAAAAAAADH8/vcPFGJ3vvt8j71isQG8UfGtY59Gr4uX9gCLcBGAs/s640/spice.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"302\" border=\"0\"></a></div>\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There's very good dialogue throughout, with some of the best lines given to an array of anonymous guards. It is good because spare in the face of a baroque religion and politics.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The Nietzschean philosophy of the book (that is, of Herbert, not just of the Fremen or of Paul) suggests a stronger connection between strength, suffering, and spiritual superiority than there actually is. But, even here, it would not be too hard to make a dove reading of <i>Dune</i>, where the actions of all ruthless parties are actually perverse.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Dune even has a proper dialect, not the usual mere conlangs. Vocal memes: several different characters say <i>\"Ah-h-h-h-h\"</i> in a particular way.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The Bene Gesserit are the best thing in the book, a cabal of galactic, psychic, eugenicist spies.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The books eventually turn against the Bene Gesserits' <i>specific</i> eugenics program, but it never lets up with hardass Darwinism (which in respectable form has been called <a href=\"https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2016/08/26/haidt-love-relationship/\">Haidtism</a>). Lots and lots of woo:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    The race of humans had felt its own dormancy, sensed itself grown stale and knew now only the need to experience turmoil in which the genes would mingle and the strong new mixtures survive. All humans were alive as an unconscious single organism in this moment, experiencing a kind of sexual heat that could override any barrier.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere's a Randian seduction in the Fremen hardass ethic. As in Nietzsche: Herbert is inviting the reader to view themselves as strong, above the mob. (If you feel nothing seductive about these books - well, you've a modest soul.)</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The second book goes into even more gritty detail: the Fremen toilets are 'reclamation stills', for instance. (I'm just impressed at the speech-act of grossing out your readers with your hero characters.)</li>\r\n\r\n<li>I've been toying with a connection between Kynes (<i>Dune</i>'s divine ecologist, who designs the rejuvenation of Arrakis) and the <a href=\"http://www.jashel.sakura.ne.jp/08kenkyu10a.pdf\">Kynde</a> of <i>Piers Plowman</i> (Nature itself, or the intuitive transcendental grasp of it). I mention this mostly just to score a literary point: no-one else has noticed.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The Fremen, his Muslim Tuareg, are actually Thracians in complexion. Xenophanes about Thrace:\r\n<blockquote><i>Men create the gods in their own image; those of the Ethiopians are black and snub-nosed, those of the Thracians have blue eyes and red hair.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>I also love his Vulcans. Rather than being the mockable and inhuman they are just <i>whaddya know</i> better at thinking:\r\n<a name=\"lol\"></a>\r\n<blockquote><i>'A mentat could not function without realising he worked in infinite systems. Fixed knowledge could not surround the infinite. <i>Everywhere</i> could not be brought into finite perspective.'\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Be a man and a mentat!\"\r\n\"I am a mentat and a man.\"</i>\r\n</blockquote></li>\r\n\r\n<li>* On the last page you are told that the epigrams are all written out of sexual frustration, the joke on the author of them:\r\n<blockquote><i>'See that princess standing there, so haughty and confident. They say she has pretensions of a literary nature. Let us hope she finds solace in such things; she'll have little else.' </i></blockquote>\r\n)\r\nCue laughtrack, applause, credits.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe quality dropped sharply between books: <i>Dune</i> is amazing, <i>Messiah</i> is slow but satisfying, <i>Children of Dune</i> is ok. Believe the hype.\r\n\r\n\r\n*********************************\r\n\r\nHow does it do as Serious science fiction?\r\n\r\n<i>    Social development</i>: Done pretty well, despite appearances. <i>Dune</i> is a wild repudiation of Whig history, that our technology and our society must progress, and progress together. \"Feudalism with energy weapons\" <a href=\"https://www.sciphijournal.org/index.php/2017/11/12/why-the-culture-wins-an-appreciation-of-iain-m-banks/\">as Heath says, half in contempt</a>.\r\n\r\n<i>    Software development</i>: No.\r\n\r\n<i> Actual Science</i>: No.",

All of them are more or less dishonestly melodramatic; for instance they depict Turing's relationship with his dead love Christopher as the driver of his work on machine intelligence. And more generally they depict him as tragic. But he wasn't tragic: we were. In the 1950s we attacked a superlatively profound person, because we were certain it was the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nHodges, whose book began the great public rehabilitation of Turing and served as the source for the films, bears no blame for this: it's one of the best biographies I've ever read (better even than Kanigel on Ramanujan and Issacson on Einstein).\r\n\r\nBegin with his achievements:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1935: <i>Mathematical statistics</i>: An independent proof of the Central Limit Theorem.</li>\r\n<li>1935: <i>Group theory</i>: <a href=\"http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/10\">An extension</a> to a theorem of von Neumann's.</li>\r\n<li>1936: <i>Mathematical logic</i>: One of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing%27s_proof\">all-time great papers</a>, an answer to Hilbert's halting problem and an elaboration of the incompleteness of all mathematics, <i>and</i> the formal statement of a single machine that can perform all computable work.</li>\r\n<li>1936: <i>Computability theory</i>: Same paper.

This puts him in the <a href=\"https://scienceheroes.com/\">top 50 life-savers</a> ever. But what is most amazing (and endearing) is just how unsophisticated he was. \r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n     As at school, trivial examples of ‘eccentricity’ circulated in Bletchley circles. Near the beginning of June he would suffer from hay fever, which blinded him as he cycled to work, so he would use a gas mask to keep the pollen out, regardless of how he looked. The bicycle itself was unique, since it required the counting of revolutions until a certain bent spoke touched a certain link (rather like a cipher machine), when action would have to be taken to prevent the chain coming off. Alan had been delighted at having, as it were, deciphered the fault in the mechanism, which meant that he saved himself weeks of waiting for repairs, at a time when the bicycle had again become what it was when invented – the means of freedom. It also meant that no one else could ride it.\r\n\r\n    He made a more explicit defence of his tea-mug (again irreplaceable, in wartime conditions) by attaching it with a combination lock to a Hut 8 radiator pipe. But it was picked, to tease him.\r\n\r\n    Trousers held up by string, pyjama jacket under his sports coat – the stories, whether true or not, went the rounds. And now that he was in a position of authority, the nervousness of his manner was more open to comment. There was his voice, liable to stall in mid-sentence with a tense, high-pitched ‘Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah’ while he fished, his brain almost visibly labouring away, for the right expression, meanwhile preventing interruption. The word, when it came, might be an unexpected one, a homely analogy, slang expression, pun or wild scheme or rude suggestion accompanied with his machine-like laugh; bold but not with the coarseness of one who had seen it all and been disillusioned, but with the sharpness of one seeing it through strangely fresh eyes. ‘Schoolboyish’ was the only word they had for it. Once a personnel form came round the Huts, and some joker filled in for him, ‘Turing A.M. Age 21’, but others, including Joan, said it should be ‘Age 16’...\r\n\r\n    It was demeaning, but the repetition of superficial anecdotes about his usually quite sensible solutions to life’s small challenges served the useful purpose of deflecting attention away from the more dangerous and difficult questions about what an Alan Turing might think about the world in which he lived. English ‘eccentricity’ served as a safety valve for those who doubted the general rules of society. More sensitive people at Bletchley were aware of layers of introspection and subtlety of manner that lay beneath the occasional funny stories. But perhaps he himself welcomed the chortling over his habits, which created a line of defence for himself, without a loss of integrity. \r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nWe have words for this now (\"nerd\", \"wonk\", \"aspie\"), and massive institutions, and even social movements, but at the time he had to make do with \"don\", and hide inside academia. Again: the problem wasn't him, it was us.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nHe gets called a mathematician most often, I suppose because people don't want to be anachronistic. But scroll up: his most famous work is as a logician and a systems architect, and much of the rest is statistics and algorithmics and cognitive science. He was falling between several chairs, until computer science caught up with him:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\na pure mathematician worked in a symbolic world and not with things. The machine seemed to be a contradiction... For Alan Turing personally, the machine was a symptom of something that could not be answered by mathematics alone. He was working within the central problems of classical number theory, and making a contribution to it, but this was not enough. The Turing machine, and the ordinal logics, formalising the workings of the mind; Wittgenstein’s enquiries; the electric multiplier and now this concatenation of gear wheels – they all spoke of making some connection between the abstract and the physical. It was not science, not ‘applied mathematics’, but a sort of applied logic, something that had no name. </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe philosopher-engineer. One of several moments in Hodge's book that left me dumbstruck is Turing <a href=\"https://praxisblog.wordpress.com/2008/03/05/wittgenstein-versus-turing-spelling-of-the-second-order/\">arguing with Wittgenstein</a> about the foundations of mathematics. (In the spring of 1939 they were both teaching courses at Cambridge called that!) Bit awkward, and in my view Alan goes easy on Ludwig. But you still couldn't make it up.\r\n\r\nThe government employed Turing for 9 years, paying him about £6000 over the duration (£150k in today's money). In that time he produced 3 gigantically advanced systems (most of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hut_8\">Hut 8</a> system, the <a href=\"http://www.turing.org.uk/sources/delilah.html\">Delilah</a> and the ACE design), about 10 or 20 years ahead of their time. Hodges sees this as a triumph of managerial socialism. Now, breaking naval enigma for £6k is an unbelievable deal (the savings from undestroyed shipping and cargo would be in the billions). But the government suppressed Delilah and totally screwed up the ACE project. So I'm not sure if we can cheer too much. Keynes says somewhere that\r\n<blockquote><i>The important thing for Government is not to do things which individuals are doing already, and to do them a little better or a little worse; but to do those things which at present are not done at all.</i></blockquote>\r\nThis is true of Enigma, I suppose. But instructive failures are only helpful if they occur in public. (As at least the ACE report was.)\r\n\r\nThe most annoying part of the films making up emotionally powerful unifying themes for Turing is that they are already there. (But to grasp them, you'd have to actually display what was most wonderful and important about him, his technical work, and there goes the box office.) Anyway, here's one that made me cry:\r\n<blockquote><i>In an end-of-term sing-song [at Sherborne, when Turing was 12], the following couplet described him: \r\n<blockquote>Turing’s fond of the football field\r\nFor geometric problems the touch-lines yield\r\n</blockquote>\r\n... another verse had him ‘watching the daisies grow’ during hockey... although intended as a joke against his dreamy passivity, there might have been a truth in the observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[20 years later] ...One day he and Joan were lying on the Bletchley lawn looking at the daisies... Alan produced a fir cone from his pocket, on which the Fibonacci numbers could be traced rather clearly, but the same idea could also be taken to apply to the florets of the daisy flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n[30 years later] ...he was trying out on the computer the solution of the very difficult differential equations that arose when [one] followed the chemical theory of [plant] morphogenesis beyond the moment of budding... it also required some rather sophisticated applied mathematics, which involved the use of ‘operators’ rather as in quantum mechanics. Numerical analysis was also important... In this it was like a private atomic bomb, the computer in both cases following the development of interacting fluid waves.\r\n\r\n...he also developed a purely descriptive theory of leaf-arrangement... using matrices to represent the winding of spirals of leaves or seeds round a stem or flower-head... The intention was that ultimately these two approaches would join up when he found a system of equations that would generate the Fibonacci patterns expressed by his matrices.\r\n\r\n...Such observations reflected an insight gained from... [a program called] ‘Outline of Development of the Daisy’. He had quite literally been ‘watching the daisies grow’...  on his universal machine.\r\n</i></blockquote>",

    "review": "Engrossing and detailed. Feynman is different from other first-rank minds: he values clarity and humour above all. He's a slightly hazardous role model though: his sheer speed, creativity, and high standards, which justify his arrogance and deviance, <i>cannot</i> be emulated by ordinary people; his mantra - \"<a href=\"https://stepsandleaps.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/feynmans-breakthrough-disregard-others/\">disregard [what other people are doing]</a>\" - is similarly high-risk; and his pickup-artistry after Arline died is at least icky. But the big <i>accessible</i> hazard is his thrilling science-supremacism. Gleick:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nFeynman told them [his self-spun legend]:\r\n   how he became known in Far Rockaway as the boy who fixed radios by thinking; how he asked a Princeton librarian for the map of the cat; how his father taught him to see through the tricks of circus mind readers; how he outwitted painters, mathematicians, philosophers, and psychiatrists.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nFeynman:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it. Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHis cheeky scientism will make unread teenagers insufferable at parties. More seriously, it could return our scientists to unreflective, uninspired positivism. But his anti-authoritarianism, his anti-pretension, his honest and sweeping scepticism, his existential peace, more than compensate. Filtering out the above, his life is an enormously fruitful applied epistemology.\r\n\r\nIt is shocking, to anyone who knows the modern salami-slicing academic world, to hear how many breakthroughs he didn't publish, just out of high standards:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    A great physicist who accumulated knowledge without taking the trouble to publish could be a genuine danger to his colleagues. At best it was unnerving to learn that one’s potentially career-advancing discovery had been, to Feynman, below the threshold of publishability. At worst it undermined one’s confidence in the landscape of the known and not known.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnd how he resisted <a href=\"http://johnquiggin.com/2009/05/27/a-taxonomy-of-delusion/\">emeritus</a> <a href=\"https://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2556\">disease</a> to the end. Hawking: “We may now be near the end of the search for the ultimate laws of nature,”. Feynman:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    I’ve had a lifetime of that. I’ve had a lifetime of people who believe that the answer is just around the corner. But again and again it’s been a failure. Eddington, who thought that with the theory of electrons and quantum mechanics everything was going to be simple... Einstein, who thought that he had a unified theory just around the corner but didn’t know anything about nuclei and was unable of course to guess it... People think they’re very close to the answer, but I don’t think so...\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhether or not nature has an ultimate, simple, unified, beautiful form is an open question, and I don’t want to say either way.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFeynman's ideas are still completely modern. He'll be modern for a long time to come, too: as the main theorist of the path integral formulation of QM, the first theorist of nanotechnology and quantum computing, as storyteller, as a complete master of applied epistemology for humans.",

    "review": "<i>    In one sentence</i>: A psychologically realistic utopia (: a flawed one) nestled in a soft opera-of-space-operas.\n    \n<i>    To be read when</i>: you don't think we have anywhere to go. / On a train.\n\n(This is more of a review of the <i>Culture</i> series. <i>Excession</i> is my favourite of them - even just seeing that slightly bad 90s cover gets a reaction out of me - but none of the books is so great on its own. I just keep re-reading them. <a href=\"https://www.sciphijournal.org/index.php/2017/11/12/why-the-culture-wins-an-appreciation-of-iain-m-banks/\">This essay</a> gives a flavour of the intellectual thrill  underneath Banks' hand-waving, hand-wringing, and gags. Start with <i>Player of Games</i> or <i>Use of Weapons</i>, and leave <i>Phlebas</i> to last, it's not great except thematically.)\n\nThe two worst omissions from sci-fi are social development and software development. Banks covers the first so memorably, so thrillingly, that the series is a permanent touchstone for me. The Culture is <i>actually</i> different from us - even though underneath their society revs our great alien machine, liberalism unbound.\n\nBanks was always quite open about how didactic his sci-fi was; it is saved by his inventiveness and psychological realism amidst technological fantasy.\n\nThis scene (from <i>Use of Weapons</i>) had a large effect on me as a child:\n<blockquote><i>\n    'Of course I don't have to do this,' one middle-aged man said, carefully cleaning the table with a damp cloth. He put the cloth in a little pouch, sat down beside him. \"But look; this table's clean.'\n         He agreed that the table was clean.\n         \"Usually,' the man said. \"I work on alien -- no offence -- alien religions; Directional Emphasis In Religious Observance; that's my specialty ... like when temples or graves or prayers always have to face in a certain direction; that sort of thing? Well, I catalogue, evaluate, compare; I come up with theories and argue with colleagues, here and elsewhere. But ... the job's never finished; always new examples, and even the old ones get re-evaluated, and new people come along with new ideas about what you thought was settled ... but,' he slapped the table, \"when you clean a table you clean a table. You feel you've done something. It's an achievement.\"\n         \"But in the end, it's still cleaning a table.\"\n         \"And therefore does not really signify on the cosmic scale of events?' the man suggested.\n         He smiled in response to the man's grin, \"Well, yes.'\n         'But then what does signify? My other work? Is that really important, either?' I could try composing wonderful musical works, or day-long entertainment epics, but what would that do? Give people pleasure? My wiping this table gives me pleasure. And people come to a clean table, which gives them pleasure. And anyway\" - the man laughed - \"people die; stars die; universes die. What is any achievement, however great it was, once time itself is dead? Of course, if all I did was wipe tables, then of course it would seem a mean and despicable waste of my huge intellectual potential. But because I choose to do it, it gives me pleasure. And,\" the man said with a smile, \"it's a good way of meeting people.\" \n</blockquote></i>\n\nAs did this, before I studied formal philosophy and received a resounding confirmation of it:\n\n<blockquote><i>\n         “Aw, come on; argue, dammit.”\n         “I don’t believe in argument,” he said, looking out.\n         “You don’t?” Erens said, genuinely surprised. “Shit, and I thought I was the cynical one.”\n         “It’s not cynicism,” he said flatly. “I just think people overvalue argument because they like to hear themselves talk.”\n         “Oh well, thank you.”\n         “It’s comforting, I suppose.” He watched the stars wheel, like absurdly slow shells seen at night: rising, peaking, falling... (And reminded himself that the stars too would explode, perhaps, one day.) “Most people are not prepared to have their minds changed,” he said. “And I think they know in their hearts that other people are just the same, and one of the reasons people become angry when they argue is that they realize just that, as they trot out their excuses.”\n         “Excuses, eh?\"\n         \"Yes, excuses,\" he said, with what Erens thought might just have been a trace of bitterness. \"I strongly suspect the things people believe in are usually just what they instinctively feel is right; the excuses, the justifications, the things you're supposed to argue about, come later. They're the least important part of the belief. That's why you can destroy them, win an argument, prove the other person wrong, and still they believe what they did in the first place.\" He looked at Erens. \"You've attacked the wrong thing.” \n</blockquote></i>\nBut this was also before I got into technical pursuits which lend us hope that the above grim realism can be defeated by self-awareness, quantification, and epistemic care. Sometimes. \n\n\n<ul><li>    <a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Galef type</a>: <br>\n<b>Theory 2</b> - model of what makes something succeed or fail &\n<b>    Values 2</b> - thought experiments for you to reflect on how you feel about something.\n <b>   Style 3</b> - tickles your aesthetic sense in a way that obliquely makes you a more interesting, generative thinker.\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "review": "<i>Frankensaurus</i>. Both very clumsy and ahead of its time. Crichton is often described as a one-legged stool: i.e. he has good ideas, but no prose or characters. Ian Malcolm, his sexy radfem primitivist chaos theorist is an exception, and if anything the film's (iconic) depiction of him is less striking and seductive than the sneering pole depicted here.\r\n\r\n    It's worth picking on Malcolm because he's depicted as prescient, fundamentally correct about the island; he gets the most airtime by far, with the only pushback being Hammond saying \"pish posh!\" every so often - (Unless you count the raptor attacking him as a discursive act); he is even given the chapter header pages to be oracular on, slowly drawing a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve\">dragon curve</a> as if it meant anything. And his philosophy, endorsed by Crichton, is tepid and dismaying finger-wagging.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-D527GAe-TTM/WreCWKqIe3I/AAAAAAAAEVM/t5-78cVtGpUDVWHar5RY5CL2rgpai2skACLcBGAs/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2018-03-25%2B12-00-44.png\" />\r\n\r\nSo: He denies that modern life is better than premodern life and endorses Sahlins' lazy-bushman hypothesis: \r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ‘What advances?’ Malcolm said irritably. 'The number of hours women devote to housework has not changed since 1930, despite all the advances. All the vacuum cleaners, washer-dryers, trash compactors, garbage disposals, wash-and-wear fabrics... Why does it still take as long to clean the house as it did in 1930?’\r\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellie said nothing.\r\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because there haven’t been any advances,’ Malcolm said. 'Not really. Thirty thousand years ago, when men were doing cave paintings at Lascaux, they worked twenty hours a week to provide themselves with food and shelter and clothing. The rest of the time, they could play, or sleep, or do whatever they wanted. And they lived in a natural world, with clean air, clean water, beautiful trees and sunsets. Think about it. Twenty hours a week. Thirty thousand years ago.’\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nThe first claim is flatly false: average housework by US women <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w13985.pdf\">decreased by about 14 hours(!) a week</a> over this period. (Table 6, last column.) This is despite ballooning house sizes, inventory of objects to maintain, and time actually spent with the children. It also omits our greatly increased levels of hygiene and personal fragrance, though I suppose that could be zero-sum if we habituate to it.\r\n\r\nThe second is false but not as flatly. I can't find anyone speculating \"twenty hours\" about the economy of the Upper Paleolithic French. If Crichton is merely mashing up the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_affluent_society\">Bushman studies</a> with the punchy image of Lascaux, then despite celebrated dissemination by anthropologists, the claim is untrue: contemporary African hunter-gatherers spend <a href=\"http://www.rachellaudan.com/2016/01/was-the-agricultural-revolution-a-terrible-mistake.html\">more than 50 hours a week on food production</a>. Worse, Malcolm's smug rant puts zero weight on the <a href=\"http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/life_history/aging_evolution/hill_2007_hiwi_mortality.html\">giant disease burden</a>, the constant warfare, the giant boredom, the crushing conformity and illiberty of nomad life, and the perfect absence of intellectual life among the ancients.\r\n\r\n(Judging by the <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3654\">hostility of Pinker's reviewers</a>, Ian Malcolm is still with us, railing against e.g. consumerism and overpopulation - as if those weren't people just trying to live their lives - and reductionism, denying or minimising the huge material and spiritual gains of science and other blessed modernities.)\r\n\r\nMore: Malcolm is himself wildly overconfident about modelling, e.g. the fit of basic fractal theory to the park disaster; Crichton is credulous about the almost-completely unfulfilled promises of the wild-eyed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute\">Santa Fe</a> set. <blockquote><i>\r\nThey believed that prediction was just a function of keeping track of things. If you knew enough, you could predict anything\r\n</i></blockquote> The latter claim is true for all phenomena except pure random number generators though; the untrue version Crichton means depends on ignorantly thinking that \"predict\" always (or ever) means \"predict with certainty\".\r\n\r\nCrichton was a programmer, and there's a nice wee code listing in a critical moment, in a made up language resembling <a href=\"https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/135417/what-can-we-infer-about-the-programming-language-used-in-jurassic-park-the-bo\">Perl + Forth + COBOL</a>. Definitely optimised for making the reader feel smart for reading it, or vindicated in skipping it. But points still.",

Their animating idea — that to overcome racism, the United States must discard any pretense to colorblindness — has become accepted across broad swathes of the mainstream Left. For better or worse, however, it marks a stark departure from King’s appeal that skin color should be ignored. The battle between colorblindness and active anti-racism will have enormous consequences for American society. </i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n- <a href=\"http://quillette.com/2018/02/14/dont-abandon-king-standard/\">Christian Gonzalez</a>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nIn attempting to restore his community through reintroducing precepts, namely segregation and slavery, that, given his cultural history, have come to define his community despite the supposed unconstitutionality and nonexistence of these concepts, he’s pointed out a fundamental flaw in how we as Americans claim we see equality.\r\n\r\n‘I don’t care if you’re black, white, brown, yellow, red, green, or purple.’ We’ve all said it... He’s painting everybody over, painting this community purple and green, and seeing who still believes in equality.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n- a judge in <i>The Sellout</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>The Sellout</i> is filled with racism and racists - for one thing, the nearly-nameless protagonist, the Sellout, brings back segregated busses and schools, and (reluctantly) owns a volunteer slave - but the book is clearly itself not racist. (I can even quantify how much racism's in it: at one point a pompous character counts the slurs in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, arguing for censoring it:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nThis is serious. Brother Mark Twain uses the ‘n-word’ 219 times. That’s .68 ‘n-words’ per page in toto.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell, including 'weren*r' and 'n*rized', etc, Beatty manages 146, or 0.52 a page. It feels like more.)\r\n\r\nThat isn't the confusing bit; what is, is that none of the presented racists are white; in fact no substantial characters are. (The single <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ISQcDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=the+sellout+laura+jane&source=bl&ots=Sm3u746JtI&sig=pQMpsjaOPbJMQGD_E4rBedjyvb4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7yenOsrDZAhUEKFAKHRKHB4sQ6AEITzAF#v=onepage&q=laura%20jane&f=false\">named</a> white person is present for all of seven pages, and is merely innocently patronising.) We could stretch and say that this is Beatty exclaiming at internalised racism. Or it could be a unusual claim about where racism (in the established sense of propositional or emotional racism, as opposed to structural racism) is openly expressed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/us/lawsuit-alleges-discrimination-against-blacks-at-national-job-agency.html\">now</a>: <a href=\"https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3352700/gay_seeingdifference.pdf?sequence=2\">among</a> <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2014/05/20/a_matter_of_death_and_death_confronting_anti_black_racism_among_latinos/\">nonwhites</a>. (Or he could seriously just be trolling.) \r\n\r\n<i>Further</i>, it isn't just a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal\">Modest Proposal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?dcr=0&source=hp&ei=byxuWqzKLYa00gXg0owg&q=%22the+sellout%22+a+modest+proposal&oq=%22the+sellout%22+a+modest+proposal&gs_l=psy-ab.3...240.3985.0.4355.24.18.3.0.0.0.333.2114.4j6j3j1.14.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..7.15.1809.0..0j46j0i131k1j0i10k1j0i46k1.0.w_3ACVhc-fI\">despite the prevalence of this mistake of interpretation</a>. A modest proposal is the deadpan presentation of a policy to make the reader realise that it is disgusting. In <i>The Sellout</i>, separatism and degradation <i>work</i>, they improve Dickens for the segregated: the policies are popular, grades go up, crime goes down, and people are polite within and without race categories. What is this saying?\r\n\r\nIt's hard to work out Beatty's schtick, partly because the whole of the first 100 pages is a string of horrible and bravura one-liners, from \"black literature sucks\":\r\n<blockquote><i>I’m so fucking tired of black women always being described by their skin tones! Honey-colored this! Dark-chocolate that! My paternal grandmother was mocha-tinged, café-au-lait, graham-fucking-cracker brown!\r\n\r\nHow come they never describe the white characters in relation to foodstuffs and hot liquids? Why aren’t there any yogurt-colored, egg-shell-toned, string-cheese-skinned, low-fat-milk white protagonists in these racist, no-third-act-having books? That’s why black literature sucks!\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Maybe race had nothing to do with it. Maybe Rosa Parks didn’t give up her seat because she knew the guy to be unapologetically gassy or one of those annoying people who insists on asking what you’re reading, then without prompting tells you what he’s reading, what he wants to read, what he regrets having read, what he tells people he’s read but really hasn’t read. So like those high school white girls who have after-school sex with the burly black athlete in the wood shop, and then cry rape when their fathers find out, maybe Rosa Parks, after the arrest, the endless church rallies, and all the press, had to cry racism, because what was she going to say: “I refused to move because the man asked me what I was reading”? Negroes would’ve lynched her.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>I’d rather be called ‘nigger’ than ‘giantess’ any day of the week.”<br><br>\r\n“Problematic,” someone muttered - invoking the code word black thinkers use to characterize anything or anybody that makes them feel uncomfortable, impotent, and painfully aware that they don’t have the answers to questions and assholes like me.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nReviewers resolve this, in their neat way, by saying that Beatty is satirising \"race in America\". But that doesn't mean anything: Beatty is indiscriminate: mocking stereotyped black behaviour <i>and</i> police brutality, <i>and</i> pious diversity pushers, <i>and</i> white arrogance, <i>and</i> classic Civil Rights heroes, <i>and</i> radical black intellectuals, <i>and</i> assimilated Establishment black elites, <i>and</i> colorblind universalists. So, you <i>can</i> say \"it satirises [more or less every position you can take on] race in America\". But what's the point of doing that? <br><br>\r\n\r\nI can think of three: 1) to say that there is no sensible position on this seething topic; or 2) to say that we haven't found it yet and must move past the existing positions, or 3) to use the nasty symmetry between the racist and the active anti-racist, to reflect well on <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/\">Coatesian justice</a> - maybe the thought is: 'colorblind egalitarianism is such a mad idea that even naked nineteenth-century racism is superior to it'.) \r\n\r\nI don't know which (if any) is Beatty's view. I know I don't agree. There's nothing actually wrong with <a href=\"http://quillette.com/2018/02/14/dont-abandon-king-standard/\">MLK's principle</a>, <i>judge absolutely everyone on their own merits rather than treating them as a representative of their race or sex or anything</i>, though it has usually been poorly realised.\r\n\r\nBut I respect the chutzpah of pissing everyone off. If nothing else it's original and bullshit-free, two rare predicates around here.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>I’m not sure what Unmitigated Blackness is, but whatever it is, it doesn’t sell. Unmitigated Blackness is simply not giving a fuck. Clarence Cooper, Charlie Parker, Richard Pryor, Maya Deren, Sun Ra, Mizoguchi, Frida Kahlo, black-and-white Godard, Céline, Gong Li, David Hammons, Björk, and the Wu-Tang Clan in any of their hooded permutations. Unmitigated Blackness is essays passing for fiction. It’s the realization that there are no absolutes, except when there are. It’s the acceptance of contradiction not being a sin and a crime but a human frailty like split ends and libertarianism. Unmitigated Blackness is the realization that as fucked up as it all is, sometimes it’s nihilism that makes life worth living.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nor \r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nDaddy never believed in closure. He said it was a false psychological concept. Something invented by therapists to assuage white Western guilt. In all his years of study and practice, he’d never heard a patient of color talk of needing “closure.” They needed revenge. They needed distance. Forgiveness and a good lawyer maybe, but never closure. He said people mistake suicide, murder, lap band surgery, interracial marriage, and overtipping for closure, when in reality what they’ve achieved is erasure.\r\n\r\nThe problem with closure is that once you have a taste of it, you want it in every little aspect of your life. Especially when you’re bleeding to death, and your slave, who is in full rebellion, is screaming,... you attempt to stanch the bleeding with a waterlogged copy of <b>Vibe</b> magazine someone has left in the gutter. Kanye West has announced, “I am rap!” Jay-Z thinks he’s Picasso. And life is fucking fleeting.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHere's what I think is going on: It's hard to get through to people with the usual homilies and pieties, because they are deadened by cliché, bureaucratic muscle, tribalism, and historical ineffectualness. After hundreds of pages of troublingly hilarious japes (including ironic delight in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/K_mlv2UCuHo?t=1m26s\">old racist tv shows</a>), Beatty has softened you up, left bare the old wound. That all may be healed, all must be shown.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2AElhR5TfPc/WnijcZwcCBI/AAAAAAAAEG0/JxOHhfp3A48ie7ejI_HkgiJU5tUP0dcMACLcBGAs/s640/compton-cowboys-photo-essay.jpg\" width=\"400\" />\r\n <small>(c) Richard Vogel (2016)</small>\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, is the Sellout a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/oct/29/baddies-in-books-humbert-humbert-lolita\">charming pervert</a>? A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/09/i-hate-being-a-black-man\">self-hating</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ruckus\">masochist</a>? Or a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_nihilist_movement#Mikhail_Bakunin's_Influence\">nihilist</a> with moral purpose?<br><br>\r\n\r\nSpoiler! It's the first and third. Beatty <i>has no answer</i> and is again brave enough to say so; the book's last page admits no synthesis can win over that particular sceptic: Obama isn't enough, nothing is enough:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nI remember the day after the black dude was inaugurated, Foy Cheshire, proud as punch, driving around town in his coupe, honking his horn and waving an American flag. He wasn’t the only one celebrating; the neighborhood glee wasn’t O. J. Simpson getting acquitted or the Lakers winning the 2002 championship, but it was close. Foy drove past the crib and I happened to be sitting in the front yard husking corn. “Why are you waving the flag?” I asked him. “Why now? I’ve never seen you wave it before.” He said that he felt like the country, the United States of America, had finally paid off its debts. “And what about the Native Americans? What about the Chinese, the Japanese, the Mexicans, the poor, the forests, the water, the air, the fucking California condor? When do they collect?” I asked him.\r\n\r\nHe just shook his head at me. Said something to the effect that my father would be ashamed of me and that I’d never understand. And he’s right. I never will.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe protagonist segregates, and says things like this:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nI’m a farmer, and farmers are natural segregationists. We separate the wheat from the chaff. I’m not Rudolf Hess, P. W. Botha, Capitol Records, or present-day U.S. of A. Those motherfuckers segregate because they want to hold on to power. I’m a farmer: we segregate in an effort to give every tree, every plant, every poor Mexican, every poor nigger, a chance for equal access to sunlight and water; we make sure every living organism has room to breathe.</i>\r\n</blockquote><br>\r\n\r\nAnd yet he is not a separatist; he knows it's wrong when the minorities are shouted out of the public space:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nWhat the fuck you honkies laughing at?” he shouted. More chuckling from the audience. The white couple howling the loudest. Slapping the table. Happy to be noticed. Happy to be accepted. “I ain’t bullshitting! What the fuck are you interloping motherfuckers laughing at? Get the fuck out!”<br>\r\n\r\nThere’s nothing funny about nervous laughter. The forced way it slogs through a room with the stop-and-start undulations of bad jazz brunch jazz. The black folks and the round table of Latinas out for a night on the town knew when to stop laughing. The couple didn’t. The rest of us silently sipped our canned beer and sodas, determined to stay out of the fray. They were laughing solo because this had to be part of the show, right?\r\n\r\n“Do I look like I’m fucking joking with you? This shit ain’t for you. Understand? Now get the fuck out! This is our thing!” \r\n\r\nNo more laughter. Only pleading, unanswered looks for assistance, then the soft scrape of two chairs being backed, quietly as possible, away from the table. The blast of cold December air and the sounds of the street. The night manager shutting the doors behind them, leaving little evidence that the white people had ever been there except for an unfulfilled two-drink, three-donut minimum.\r\n\r\nWhen I think about that night, the black comedian chasing the white couple into the night, their tails and assumed histories between their legs, I don’t think about right or wrong. No, when my thoughts go back to that evening, I think about my own silence. Silence can be either protest or consent, but most times it’s fear. I guess that’s why I’m so quiet and such a good whisperer, nigger and otherwise. It’s because I’m always afraid. Afraid of what I might say. What promises and threats I might make and have to keep. That’s what I liked about the man, although I didn’t agree with him when he said, “Get out. This is our thing.” I respected that he didn’t give a fuck. But I wish I hadn’t been so scared, that I had had the nerve to stand in protest. Not to castigate him for what he did or to stick up for the aggrieved white people... but I wish I’d stood up to the man and asked him a question: “So what exactly is our thing?</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is my laughter, but not my flight. <i>The Sellout</i> doesn't have an ism: they are all found wanting. I'm just glad it is still possible to explore this godforsaken crater without being screamed down. I'm glad Beatty didn't let it get to him, even if he leaves the Sellout hanging.",

    "review": "A powerful book, remarkably light on ideology given its extreme conclusions. (Caplan is not mad: he is right behind universal numeracy and literacy. So the title should be \"Case Against Higher Education\" but oh well.)\r\n\r\nHere's a flavour:\r\n<blockquote><i>I have a <a href=\"http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/caplannaik.pdf\">long</a> <a href=\"http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/e854/pc13.pdf\">list</a> <a href=\"http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/pdfs/szasz.pdf\">of</a> <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/04/the_common-sens.html\">strange</a> <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/04/how_free_were_1.html\">and</a> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/046501867X?ie=UTF8&tag=bryacaplwebp-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=046501867X\">extreme</a> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691174652/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=bryacaplwebp-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=2a0c58e873ed68d8abd86c1449dd0968&creativeASIN=0691174652\">views</a>, and I've been an arrogant <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/02/better_a_fox_than_a_hedgehog\">hedgehog</a> for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; As a rule, arrogant hedgehogs with lots of strange and extreme views are severely biased and grossly unreliable.&nbsp; Which raises two daunting questions.\r\n\r\n<i>The Reputational Challenge:</i> Why should people take me seriously?&nbsp; Even if I happen to be correct, why would a reasonable person bother giving me a chance?&nbsp; <br><br><i>The Self-Referential Challenge:</i> Why should I take <i>myself</i> seriously?&nbsp; Why should I consider myself so epistemically superior to the typical arrogant hedgehog with lots of strange and extreme views?<br><br>In all honesty, I take both challenges seriously.&nbsp; But it's the self-referential challenge that weighs on me.&nbsp; I can endure the apathy of others, but not the idea that I'm living a lie.&nbsp; So what should I do?</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhat might explain the universal appeal of education?\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>1. learning specific facts and hard skills (private and social gain)</li>\r\n  <li>2. learning general rationality and meta-skills (private and social gain)</li>\r\n  <li>3. learning soft skills (private and social gain)</li>\r\n  <li>4. credentialing: showing off how smart, conscientious, conformist you are (zero-sum private gain)</li> \r\n  <li>5. culture fit: showing employers you are their kind of person (private gain)</li>\r\n  <li>6. networking (private gain)</li> \r\n  <li>7. <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/15/college-marriage-facebook/2989039/\">assortative mating</a> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/college-graduates-marry-other-college-graduates-most-of-the-time/274654/\">at university</a> (near-zero-sum private gain)</li> \r\n  <li>8. primary schools are daycare (private gain by proxy (parents), social gain (doubling workforce))</li> \r\n  <li>9. it's fun (private gain)</li>\r\n  <li>10. conspicuous consumption (zero-sum private gain)</li>\r\n  <li>11. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/sep/07/education-graduation-oecd-university\">state propaganda</a> about <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2008/12/15/propaganda-international-comparisons\">how developed</a> the country is. (zero-sum and of no private or social gain)</li> \r\n</ol>\r\nHis conclusion is that about 80% of the personal economic gains from higher education are from (4): <i>not</i> improving your character, knowledge, or ability, but rather from certifying yourself as a good worker (smart, conscientious, conformist). Given the vast cost, time sink, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/series/mental-health-a-university-crisis\">psychological toll</a> of education, this implies a hugely wasteful, zero-sum arms race (grade inflation, degree inflation), since the income gain doesn't reflect productivity gain, and since we could be doing signalling in less indirect and foolish ways. I'll do a proper rundown of the (many) arguments he gives to end up at this separately.\r\n\r\nThe mostly-signalling theory explains a huge number of confusing features (why do students and employers not value Ivy League MOOCs, even ten years on? Why are most of the income rewards concentrated in the instant of graduation? Why do students cheer when class is cancelled? If lectures are so economically powerful, why don't people just sit in on them without enrolling (and why doesn't the university put security on them to protect their livelihood)? How can human capital explain the income gains, when people forget almost everything about their major within 5 years and don't show very large soft skill increases?\r\n\r\nYou often see people trumpeting the large (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/305e85d4-6489-11e6-a08a-c7ac04ef00aa\">50-60%</a>) income premium of higher education, as if that showed that added human capital was the reason for the premium (cough, correlation / causation). But even granting that uncritical leap, there's something strange about focussing on private income gains: the kind of people who believe in the centrality of education tend also to believe that pay is a poor indicator of social value. (For instance, our incredibly low opinion of investment bankers.) Caplan's disturbing point is that the private returns do not translate into social returns. This seeming paradox could happen a few ways: if credential inflation shifts jobs from nongraduates to graduates; or if there <i>are</i> minor human capital gains, but swamped out by the huge financial cost and time cost of uni. \r\n\r\nMy philosophy department used to trumpet graduate income stats as evidence that critical thinking is valued in industry. (They don't anymore, possibly because <a href=\"https://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Earnings-by-Degrees-REPORT-1.pdf\">philosophy is now associated with decreased earnings</a>, at least in the UK.)  This trump was an amusing triple failure of critical thinking: they confuse correlation and causation (\"philosophy degree and income gain, therefore philosophy degree causes income gain\"), fail to consider selection effects (philosophy students start out posher than the average student) <i>and</i> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician%27s_syllogism\">the <i>Yes Minister</i> fallacy</a>:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A philosophy degree causes an income premium.</li>\r\n<li>If something causes an income premium then it is valued in industry.</li>\r\n<li>A philosophy degree causes critical thinking.</li>\r\n<li>Therefore, critical thinking is valued in industry.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nThe big concern with the sweeping cuts Caplan recommends is: how do you stop poor people losing their ability to signal their virtues, if the state withdraws the current subsidy? \r\n\r\nRemarkably, the book is in large part not based on economists' research: there is as much sociology, . This triangulation strikes me as the way to write lasting social science, social science with a chance of still being relevant in a decade. Who writes like this, aside from <a href=\"https://publicchoice.gmu.edu/faculty-and-staff\">the GMU mob</a>?\r\n\r\nCaplan is modest, thoughtful, an admirable empiricist. If you can't accept his argument you have a lot of work to do before you break even.",

A nearby field, a ray of sunlight, a little bit of calm along with a bit of bread, not to feel oppressed by the knowledge that I exist, not to demand anything from others, and not to have others demand anything from me - this was denied me, like the spare change we might deny a beggar not because we're mean-hearted but because we don't feel like unbuttoning our coat.</i></blockquote>\r\nPessoa's uniqueness was invisible during his life; this is a shining, astonishing instance of what we now call neuroatypicality and of the everyday sublime. He's obsessed with cute fatalism, with his own inadequacy, with nothingness and loneliness, but almost every passage is wise or funny or beautiful. I catch no despair off him. Turning shite to gold. Like Larkin if Larkin were likeable; like Montaigne if terser and darker. \r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nAnd at this table in my absurd room, I, a pathetic and anonymous office clerk, write words as if they were the soul's salvation, and I gild myself with the impossible sunset of high and vast hills in the distance, with the statue I received in exchange for life's pleasures, and with the ring of renunciation on my evangelical finger, the stagnant jewel of my ecstatic disdain.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nFloreat inertia! the worker-poet distinctive and supreme. I first read this on a 22-hour international journey, unsleeping, undrinking, unreal; I prescribe the same conditions for you when you read him.\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nI feel love for all this, perhaps because I have nothing else to love... even though nothing truly merits the love of any soul, if, out of sentiment, we must give it, I might as well lavish it on the smallness of an inkwell as on the grand indifference of the stars.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThis paperback is a super-slim selection of the full chaotic archive he left behind; only a tenth of the full <i>Desassossego</i> archive has been translated in to English; this is a great temptation towards a language I presently have no other reason to learn. \r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li>    <a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Galef type</a>: \r\nData 1 - a window onto an interesting piece of the world, &\r\n    Value 3 - written from a holistic value structure, letting you experience that value structure from the inside, &\r\n    Style 2 - from which you can learn a style of thinking by studying the author’s approach to the world.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<i><blockquote>\r\nOne of my constant preoccupations is trying to understand how it is that other people exist, how it is that there are souls other than mine and consciousnesses not my own, which, because it is a consciousness, seems to me unique. I understand perfectly that the man before me uttering words similar to mine and making the same gestures I make, or could make, is in some way my fellow creature. However, I feel just the same about the people in illustrations I dream up, about the characters I see in novels or the dramatis personae on the stage who speak through the actors representing them.\r\n\r\nI suppose no one truly admits the existence of another person. One might concede that the other person is alive and feels and thinks like oneself, but there will always be an element of difference, a perceptible discrepancy, that one cannot quite put one's finger on. There are figures from times past, fantasy-images in books that seem more real to us than these specimens of indifference-made-flesh who speak to us across the counters of bars, or catch our eye in trams, or brush past us in the empty randomness of the streets. The others are just part of the landscape for us, usually the invisible landscape of the familiar.\r\n\r\nI feel closer ties and more intimate bonds with certain characters in books, with certain images I've seen in engravings, that with many supposedly real people, with that metaphysical absurdity known as 'flesh and blood'. In fact 'flesh and blood' describes them very well: they resemble cuts of meat laid on the butcher's marble slab, dead creatures bleeding as though still alive, the sirloin steaks and cutlets of Fate.\r\n\r\nI'm not ashamed to feel this way because I know it's how everyone feels. The lack of respect between men, the indifference that allows them to kill others without compunction (as murderers do) or without thinking (as soldiers do), comes from the fact that no one pays due attention to the apparently abstruse idea that other people have souls too.\r\n</i></blockquote>",

    "review": "<blockquote><i>Atrocious, agonising things are happening to people like you, me and our loved ones right now. The full horror of some sorts of suffering is literally unspeakable and unimaginably dreadful. Under a Darwinian regime of natural reproduction, truly horrible experiences - as well as endemic low-grade malaise - are both commonplace and inevitable. Chapter Two argues the moral case for stopping this nastiness. Since 'ought' implies 'can', however, it must first be established that scrapping unpleasant experience really is a biologically feasible option... from an information-theoretic perspective, what counts is not our absolute location on the pleasure-pain axis, but that we are \"informationally sensitive\" to fitness-relevant changes in our internal and external environment. Gradients of bliss can suffice both to motivate us and offer a rich network of feedback mechanisms; so alas today do gradients of Darwinian discontent.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nOn what science is for, on the very most we could aim for.\r\n\r\nLate one evening, early one morning, I realised that I was not reading a crank on the internet. I'm not sure what exactly tipped me off: the page was called <i>The Abolition of Suffering; the Naturalisation of Heaven</i>. Maybe the extensive and thoughtful series of <a href=\"https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon4.htm#objections\">responses to objections</a>. Not as late as the heart-stopping <i><a href=\"https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon2.htm#alone\">Alone Amongst the Zombies</a></i>. Or the mixture of staggering ambition with modesty: \r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n         As hedonic engineering develops into a mature biomedical discipline, the generic modes of paradise we opt for can be genetically pre-coded... The innovative, high-specification bio-heavens beyond will be far richer. We lack the semantic competence to talk about them sensibly. Yet however inelegantly our goal may be accomplished at first, the ultimate strategic objective should be the neurochemical precision-engineering of happiness for every sentient organism on the planet.\r\n\r\n         Sounds flaky? Yes, but then so, originally, has almost every radical reform movement in history (including, of course, the genuinely flaky ones.) </i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nand philosophy with biochemistry. It is difficult to return to what you were studying - mealy-mouthed, apologist, naturalistic-fallacious bioconservative bioethics - after that.\r\n\r\nI hadn't considered wild-animal suffering before, the giant and at-best-ignored horror it is. People are at last starting to work on this, but Pearce was there decades ago. We have a long way to go before people <a href=\"https://www.peta.org/about-peta/why-peta/predator-reintroduction-programs/\">stop making it worse</a> even.\r\n\r\nMore than {Singer, Ord, LessWrong}, Pearce set me on my way with an ideal ethics, which led quickly to effective altruism and AI safety. I'm not a negative utilitarian like him, but unlike <a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/negative-utilitarianism/#refs\">almost everyone else</a> I take that challenge seriously. \r\n\r\nI've met half a dozen people whose lives he affected this strongly, but the nonacademic setting limits his status.\r\n\r\n(The published collection <i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Biotechnology-Abolish-Suffering-David-Pearce-ebook/dp/B075MV9KS2\">Can Biotechnology Abolish Suffering?</a></i> is better, newer, covering more ground.

    "review": "If fantasy tends to strike you as pompous or tasteless - if you can't get through 'Lord of the Rings', 'Game of Thrones' or whatnot, you should try this. Anthropological fantasies. The first three books are about: mortality, deconversion and addiction. But the fourth, about two women in two farmhouses, is actually the most ambitious.\r\n\r\n'Tales of Earthsea' is my favourite, but you can't just skip to it, since it gets its power from reprise and reprisal.\r\n\r\nThe cycle <i>is</i> relentlessly pro-death though; Ged does not become a man until he faces and integrates a manifestation of his own death; Cob's terror of, and resistance to death enslaves and drains the entire continent; an ancient attempt to create an afterlife is actually an act of betrayal, colonialism, and Frankensteinian hubris. The cycle ends with the circle of life and death restored, and everyone right pleased and relieved at this, not least the undead who get to not exist. Now, you can counter that le Guin is more pro-stoicism, pro-serenity, pro-enlightened-adaption-to-the-inevitable than she is pro-death. But deathists always are; they are harmful because of their apriori ban on potentially wonderful undertakings, not because they are goth as fuck.\r\n\r\nAs always, she is a wonderful read even when I disagree with her very strongly. To be read by 10 year olds and 27 year olds, presumably by 50 year olds and definitely by 75 year olds.",

    "review": "Important and flawed. It is very hard to think clearly about these things (witness the many inconsistent uses of the term \"bias\" in the field) but O'Neil goes some way toward this. She is more balanced than average, recognising that algorithms can be an improvement over human bias and pettiness (she praises FICO scores as the liberating thing it was, moving money from those bank managers liked to reliable people of any stripe).\r\n\r\nThe mass, covert automation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic\">business logic</a> in schools, universities, policing, sentencing, recruitment, health, voting... Much to admire: she is a quant (an expert high-stakes modeller) herself, understands the deep potential of modelling, and prefaces her negative examples with examples of great models, methods of math construction.\r\n\r\nShe was one of the few technically literate people in Occupy:\r\n<blockquote><i>in mid-2011, when Occupy Wall Street sprang to life in Lower Manhattan, I saw that we had work to do among the broader public. Thousands had gathered to demand economic justice and accountability. And yet when I heard interviews with the Occupiers, they often seemed ignorant of basic issues related to finance...</i></blockquote>\r\nThey were lucky to have her!\r\n\r\nFollowing recent convention, she calls the decision systems 'algorithms'. But it isn't the abstract program that does the harm, but being credulous about their predictions. Programs only do harm when they are allowed to make or guide decisions.\r\n\r\nShe flip-flops between thinking that false positives are the problem, and that any positives based on uncomfortable variables are the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also \"recommender systems\", \"info filtering systems\", \"decision-making systems\", \"credit scoring\".\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Predictive models are, increasingly, the tools we will be relying on to run our institutions, deploy our resources, and manage our lives. But as I’ve tried to show throughout this book, these models are constructed not just from data but from the choices we make about which data to pay attention to—and which to leave out. Those choices are not just about logistics, profits, and efficiency. They are fundamentally moral...\r\n\r\nBig Data processes codify the past. They do not invent the future. Doing that requires moral imagination, and that’s something only humans can provide. We have to explicitly embed better values into our algorithms, creating models that follow our ethical lead.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nShe covers most of the objections I would make to a less subtle author:\r\n<blockquote><i>It is true, as data boosters are quick to point out, that the human brain runs internal models of its own, and they’re often tinged with prejudice or self-interest. So its outputs—in this case, teacher evaluations—must also be audited for fairness. And these audits have to be carefully designed and tested by human beings, and afterward automated. In the meantime, mathematicians can get to work on devising models to help teachers measure their own effectiveness and improve.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nShe does not include inaccuracy as a named criterion for WMDs, but her discussions sometimes require it. This is maybe the core shortcoming of the book: it doesn't wrestle much with the hard tradeoff involved in when modelling unfair situations, e.g. living in a bad neighbourhood which increases your risks and insurance costs through no fault of your own. She comes down straightforwardly on the direct \"make the model pretend it isn't there\" diktat. \r\n\r\nBut then she notes a case where fairness trumped accuracy and still sucked. \"Value-added modelling\" of teacher quality:\r\n<blockquote><i>The teacher scores derived from the tests measured nothing. This may sound like hyperbole. After all, kids took tests, and those scores contributed to Clifford’s. That much is true. But Clifford’s scores, both his humiliating 6 and his chest-thumping 96, were based almost entirely on approximations that were so weak they were essentially random.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that the administrators lost track of accuracy in their quest to be fair. They understood that it wasn’t right for teachers in rich schools to get too much credit when the sons and daughters of doctors and lawyers marched off toward elite universities. Nor should teachers in poor districts be held to the same standards of achievement. We cannot expect them to perform 1miracles.\r\n\r\nSo instead of measuring teachers on an absolute scale, they tried to adjust for social inequalities in the model. Instead of comparing Tim Clifford’s students to others in different neighborhoods, they would compare them with forecast models of themselves. The students each had a predicted score. If they surpassed this prediction, the teacher got the credit. If they came up short, the teacher got the blame. If that sounds primitive to you, believe me, it is.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nMy preferred measure would be to not prevent models from being rational, but instead make transfers to the victims of empirically unfair situation. (This looks pointlessly indirect, but price theory, and the harms of messing with them, is one of the few replicated economic.) My measure has the advantage of not requiring a massive interpretative creep of regulation: you just see what the models do as black boxes and then levy justice taxes after.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Statistically speaking, in these attempts to free the tests from class and color, the administrators moved from a primary to a secondary model. Instead of basing scores on direct measurement of the students, they based them on the so-called error term — the gap between results and expectations. Mathematically, this is a much sketchier proposition. Since the expectations themselves are derived from statistics, these amount to guesses on top of guesses. The result is a model with loads of random results, what statisticians call “noise.”</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Standardisation - the agreement of units and interfaces that everyone can use - is one of those boring but absolutely vital and inspiring human achievements. WMDs are a dark standardisation.\r\n\r\n* In her account, a model doesn't have to be predatory to be a WMD: for instance the recidivism estimator was first formulated by a public-spirited gent.\r\n\r\n* She says \"efficiency\" when she often means \"accuracy, and thereby efficiency\". This makes sense rhetorically, because she doesn't want to give the predatory models a halo effect from the less backhanded word \"accurate\". Also lards the texts with \"Big Data\"\r\n\r\n* The writer Charles Stross, asked recently to write the shortest possible horror story, responded: \"<i>Permanent Transferrable Employee Record</i>\". O'Neil makes us consider that this could be easily augmented with \"including employee medical histories\".\r\n\r\n* Surprisingly big evidential gaps: \r\n<blockquote><i>By 2009, it was clear that the lessons of the market collapse had brought no new direction to the world of finance and had instilled no new values. The lobbyists succeeded, for the most part, and the game remained the same: to rope in dumb money. Except for a few regulations that added a few hoops to jump through, life went on.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n* The car crash of American higher education is pretty engrossing. She credits the US News ranking with creating the whole mess though, which can't be right. Certainly it had some effect, and could fix some of its harm by including tuition fee size as a negative factor.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>even those who claw their way into a top college lose out. If you think about it, the college admissions game, while lucrative for some, has virtually no educational value. The complex and fraught production simply re-sorts and reranks the very same pool of eighteen-year-old kids in newfangled ways. They don’t master important skills by jumping through many more hoops or writing meticulously targeted college essays under the watchful eye of professional tutors. Others scrounge online for cut-rate versions of those tutors. All of them, from the rich to the working class, are simply being trained to fit into an enormous machine—to satisfy a WMD. And at the end of the ordeal, many of them will be saddled with debt that will take decades to pay off. They’re pawns in an arms race, and it’s a particularly nasty one.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Anywhere you find the combination of great need and ignorance, you’ll likely see predatory ads.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>All of these data points were proxies. In his search for financial responsibility, the banker could have dispassionately studied the numbers (as some exemplary bankers no doubt did). But instead he drew correlations to race, religion, and family connections. In doing so, he avoided scrutinizing the borrower as an individual and instead placed him in a group of people — what statisticians today would call a “bucket.” “People like you,” he decided, could or could not be trusted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFair and Isaac’s great advance was to ditch the proxies in favor of the relevant financial data, like past behavior with respect to paying bills. They focused their analysis on the individual in question—and not on other people with similar attributes. E-scores, by contrast, march us back in time. They analyze the individual through a veritable blizzard of proxies. In a few milliseconds, they carry out thousands of “people like you” calculations. And if enough of these “similar” people turn out to be deadbeats or, worse, criminals, that individual will be treated accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, people ask me how to teach ethics to a class of data scientists. I usually begin with a discussion of how to build an e-score model and ask them whether it makes sense to use “race” as an input in the model. They inevitably respond that such a question would be unfair and probably illegal. The next question is whether to use “zip code.” This seems fair enough, at first. But it doesn’t take long for the students to see that they are codifying past injustices into their model. When they include an attribute such as “zip code,” they are expressing the opinion that the history of human behavior in that patch of real estate should determine, at least in part, what kind of loan a person who lives there should get.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, the modelers for e-scores have to make do with trying to answer the question “How have people like you behaved in the past?” when ideally they would ask, “How have you behaved in the past?” The difference between these two questions is vast. Imagine if a highly motivated and responsible person with modest immigrant beginnings is trying to start a business and needs to rely on such a system for early investment. Who would take a chance on such a person? Probably not a model trained on such demographic and behavioral data.\r\n\r\n\r\nshould note that in the statistical universe proxies inhabit, they often work. More times than not, birds of a feather do fly together. Rich people buy cruises and BMWs. All too often, poor people need a payday loan. And since these statistical models appear to work much of the time, efficiency rises and profits surge. Investors double down on scientific systems that can place thousands of people into what appear to be the correct buckets. It’s the triumph of Big Data.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nMicrocosm:\r\n<blockquote><i>This is not to say that personnel departments across America are intentionally building a poverty trap, much less a racist one. They no doubt believe that credit reports hold relevant facts that help them make important decisions. After all, “The more data, the better” is the guiding principle of the Information Age. Yet in the name of fairness, some of this data should remain uncrunched.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOccasional data-poor hyperbole:\r\n<blockquote><i>Insurance is an industry that draws on the majority of the community to respond to the needs of an unfortunate minority. In the villages we lived in centuries ago, families, religious groups, and neighbors helped look after each other when fire, accident, or illness struck. In the market economy, we outsource this care to insurance companies, which keep a portion of the money for themselves and call it profit.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nMistaken in the US: the \"loss ratio\" of US insurance as a whole is greater than 100: loss-making except for financial return on held premiums.\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Workers often don’t have a clue about when they’ll be called to work. They are summoned by an arbitrary program.\r\n\r\nScheduling software also creates a poisonous feedback loop. Consider Jannette Navarro. Her haphazard scheduling made it impossible for her to return to school, which dampened her employment prospects and kept her in the oversupplied pool of low-wage workers. The long and irregular hours also make it hard for workers to organize or to protest for better conditions. Instead, they face heightened anxiety and sleep deprivation, which causes dramatic mood swings and is responsible for an estimated 13 percent of highway deaths. Worse yet, since the software is designed to save companies money, it often limits workers’ hours to fewer than thirty per week, so that they are not eligible for company health insurance. And with their chaotic schedules, most find it impossible to make time for a second job. It’s almost as if the software were designed expressly to punish low-wage workers and to keep them down.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution for the statisticians at St. George’s—and for those in other industries—would be to build a digital version of a blind audition eliminating proxies such as geography, gender, race, or name to focus only on data relevant to medical education. The key is to analyze the skills each candidate brings to the school, not to judge him or her by comparison with people who seem similar...\r\n\r\nwe’ve seen time and again that mathematical models can sift through data to locate people who are likely to face great challenges, whether from crime, poverty, or education. It’s up to society whether to use that intelligence to reject and punish them—or to reach out to them with the resources they need. We can use the scale and efficiency that make WMDs so pernicious in order to help people. It all depends on the objective we choose.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nBut how do know we what's relevant to medical education, except by correlation discovery? \r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>It would also be a cinch to pump up the income numbers for graduates. All colleges would have to do is shrink their liberal arts programs, and get rid of education departments and social work departments while they’re at it, since teachers and social workers make less money than engineers, chemists, and computer scientists. But they’re no less valuable to society.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis is obvious true on average. But on the margin?\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA 'Weapon of Math Destruction' is a model which is unaccountably damaging to many people's lives. But she doesn't cash out her criteria. So I did it for her.

    "review": "Christ: difficult. Very brief, very ordinary, and yet unsettling. \r\n\r\nHer language looks very clear – it's jargon-free – but on engaging with it you see it's blurred, terse, arduous. She never introduces the question at hand, nor does she make any introduction at all: on page 1 she sets about the concept with a monologue, an air of Wittgenstein's observational tragedy. \r\n\r\nAnyway I'm pretty sure it's about the problem of intention (‘<i>what answers ‘why?’, and why does it?</i>’ Or: ‘<i>how can teleology be explained in terms of brute causation (science)?</i>’). \r\n\r\nI think her points are that: \r\n\r\n* <li>intentions are justified with <i>reasons</i> and not evidence; </li>\r\n* <li>intentional explanation is <i>not</i> causal explanation; </li>\r\n* <li>intentional action is not amenable to a naturalist reduction (because to explain an action with reasons is precisely to not explain it with laws of nature); that intention is not a mental state but a process involving (?); </li>\r\n* <li>that we have synthetic but non-observational <i>and</i> non-inferential knowledge of the world; </li>\r\n* <li>that we have this simply because we 'know about' our bodies and intentions.</li>\r\n\r\n(That needs more work to be representative: \r\n1) if you don’t know that you are doing something, you’re not doing it intentionally; \r\n2) if it’s only during, or after the fact that you infer you’re doing something, you can’t be doing it for reasons. \r\nSo) if you are doing something intentional, you necessarily know you are doing it. \r\n\r\nShe thinks this knowledge isn’t based on observing oneself or post-hoc theorising.\r\n\r\n<i>Intention</i> was intended as the first piece of the first 'proper', psychologised account of agency. (She thought one needed an action theory before one could have a real moral theory. But consequentialism sidesteps that need, just as it ducks the free-will responsibility question, and the warm-glow problem, and the meta-ethical status of moral language... But a key need, one consequentialism can never avoid, is people’s need to assert their own importance and metaphysical uniqueness.)\r\n\r\nIf you take nothing else from it, take the \"reasons\" vs \"causes\" distinction seriously. It is a real problem, necessary for serious inquiry into humans.",

    "review": "The most vibrant presentation of sceptical empiricism since Dawkins stopped being beautiful.\r\n\r\n<i>Black Swan</i> is a furious pompous attack on macroeconomics, journalism, and risk modelling via heuristics and biases; so it is an amazing introduction to modelling. But it's also an entire original worldview, applying to history, policy, science, and personal conduct. This is taken even further (too far?) in <i>Antifragile</i>, which is more or less a work of evolutionary epistemology, or evolutionary practical ethics. There's a lot of redundancy between them; Fooled by Randomness gives you the highest signal:rant ratio.\r\n\r\nThe first three books are largely critical, hacking away at theory-blindness, model error, and the many kinds of people he sees as possessing unearned status (economists, journalists, consultants, business-book writers): this is the upswing, a chaotic attempt to give general positive advice in a world that dooms general positive advice.\r\n\r\nEvery other page has something worth hearing, for its iconoclasm, or a Latin gobbet, or catty anecdote, if not something globally and evidently true. I think he is right about 30% of the time, which is among the highest credences I have for anyone. I only think I am 35% right, for instance. But a core point is that he thinks his approach should work even given our intractable ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe core point, repeated a hundred times for various domains: In real life, many systems deteriorate without an irregular supply of stressors (non-fatal negative events), and actually benefit from them by constructively overreacting. By robbing such 'antifragile' systems of stressors, modern approaches to managing them do damage in the guise of helping out. \r\n\r\nTaleb was my introduction to the post-classical theory of reason, but the project overlaps a bit with the LessWrong school I now favour. Underneath (i.e. in the technical appendices), his approach is very similar but with more conservative goals. I think Taleb saved me years of synthesis and conceptual invention.\r\n\r\nHis conduct on Twitter (ridiculous chest-beating, insulting anyone who disagrees with him, including great scholars like Tetlock and Thaler) is embarrassing, but does not detract from the accomplishment.\r\n\r\n<i>    In one sentence</i>: Extraordinarily rude man marries classical ethics to modern mathematics and cognitive science.\r\n\r\n<i>    To be read when</i>: young; if you have a news habit; when despairing of university economics.\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li>    <a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Galef type</a>: <br>\r\nData 3 - highlights patterns in the world \r\n    & Theory 1&2&3&4&5 - a general concept or lens you can use to analyze many different things, &\r\n    Style 1 - teaches principles of thinking directly.\r\n\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",

    "review": "<li><i>In one sentence</i>: The greatest and truest western.</li>\r\n<li><i>To be read when</i>: strong-stomached; drunk as fuck.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\nSay it is 1985 A.P. (After Peckinpah). How can anyone write anything new about poor white psychopaths in the hot rural places of Victorian America? The answer turns out simple: just have prose so tight and freshening - a jet hose comprising one-third Bible, one-third Emerson, one-third Ballard - that you again uncover the  elemental bones of the Western. Also savagely de-emphasise your characters. Place them in enormous, indifferent vistas; give us no inner monologue - nor even indirect report of subjective life; have no speech marks to set their words apart from the landscapes (do not draw the eye to their presumed humanity); have no apostrophes, no hyphens even, lest we remember; have as few names as possible, leave them as types - \"kid\" or \"captain\" or \"mexican\" or \"brave\"; set their incredible violence among such vast places it looks like little; have few capital letters but for God's.\r\n\r\nLock your readers out; make everyone and everything opaque. As he says himself:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    In the neuter austerity of that terrain all phenomena were bequeathed a strange equality and no one thing nor spider nor stone nor blade of grass could put forth claim to precedence.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThese cowboys and injuns punctuate the beautiful land of Central America with hanged babies; rings of decapitate heads; a four-eyed dog; a man calmly eating his own shit; endless thirsty hallucinogenic despair. This is exhausting, quite hard to read:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    All night the wind blew and the fine dust set their teeth on edge. Sand in everything, grit in all they ate. In the morning a urinecolored sun rose blearily through panes of dust on a dim world and without feature. The animals were failing... That night they rode through a region electric and wild where strange shapes of soft blue fire ran over the metal of the horses' trappings and the wagonwheels rolled in hoops of fire and little shapes of pale blue light came to perch in the ears of the horses and in the beards of the men... the mountains on the sudden skyline stark and black and livid like a land of some other order out there whose true geology was not stone but fear.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n(As well as this Nabokovian trudge through the middle section, McCarthy sometimes steers close to the comical with sentences like '<i>Itinerant degenerates bleeding west like a heliotropic plague.</i>')\r\n\r\nA typical human interaction in this book is \"The kid looked at the man\"; no more. There's plenty of grandeur - just not in humans. \r\n\r\nAt the centre stands the Judge: Satan, Ahab and Moby Dick all in one. (\"<i>His skin is so pale as to have almost no pigment</i>.\") Racism, fear and poverty form the baseline. The Comanches, for instance, are here worse than demons \r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    ...grotesque with daubings like a company of mounted clowns... riding down upon them like a horde from a hell more horrible yet than the brimstone land of Christian reckoning...</i>\r\n</blockquote>- \"at least demons are Christian\"!\r\n\r\nLots of descriptions of the stars, inbetween brutalities\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    The night sky lies so sprent with stars that there is scarcely a space of black at all and they fall all night in bitter arcs and it is so that their numbers are no less...<br><br>\r\n    The stars burned with a lidless fixity and they drew nearer in the night until toward dawn he was stumbling among the whinstones of the uttermost ridge to heaven.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nFor the first time I understand why Aristotle's physics divides the world into different celestial and terranean operations: from down here back then, the stars look so clean and permanent, they're just not of our world, dirty, unhinged, and endangered as it has been, for almost everyone.\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n<i><a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Galef type</a></i>: \r\n<b>Data 2</b> - What does it imply about the world, that X could happen?, & \r\n<b>Style 3</b> - tickle your aesthetic sense in a way that obliquely makes you a more interesting, generative thinker.</li>",

More than any other poet, he just literally talks to you. You can roll your eyes at his gaucheness and despise his chauvinism and feel nothing all you like: that's fine. It doesn't matter. It's not the point.\r\n\r\nSo it's barely art, but he knows it. Pity any academic working on CB: these poems don't invite analysis; they are worn on their own surface. They mean just what they first mean. Many of them are just about writing poems, but I cannot resent their hollowness, since emptiness is his brush. Its main virtue is complete honesty.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    ...so much has gone by for most of us,\r\n    even the young, especially the young\r\n    for they have lost the beginning and have\r\n    the rest of the way to go;\r\n    but isn’t it strange, all i can think of now are\r\n    cucumbers, oranges, junk yards, the\r\n    old Lincoln Heights jail and\r\n    the lost loves that went so hard\r\n    and almost brought us to the edge,\r\n    the faces now without features,\r\n    the love beds forgotten.\r\n    the mind is kind: it retains the\r\n    important things:\r\n    cucumbers\r\n    oranges\r\n    junk yards\r\n    jails.\r\n    ...there used to be over 100 of us in that big room\r\n    in that jail\r\n    i was in there many\r\n    times.\r\n    you slept on the floor\r\n    men stepped on your face on the way to piss.\r\n    always a shortage of cigarettes.\r\n    names called out during the night\r\n    (the few lucky ones who were bailed out)\r\n    never you.<br>\r\n\r\n    ...when love came to us twice\r\n    and lied to us twice\r\n    we decided to never love again\r\n    that was fair\r\n    fair to us\r\n    and fair to love itself.\r\n    we ask for no mercy or no\r\n    miracles;\r\n    we are strong enough to live\r\n    and to die and to\r\n    kill flies,\r\n    attend the boxing matches, go to the racetrack,\r\n    live on luck and skill,\r\n    get alone, get alone often,\r\n    and if you can’t sleep alone\r\n    be careful of the words you speak in your sleep;\r\n    and\r\n    ask for no mercy\r\n    no miracles;\r\n    and don’t forget:\r\n    time is meant to be wasted,\r\n    love fails\r\n    and death is useless \r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nEverything that people mock Leonard Cohen for is much more true of Bukowski (misery, drawling, self-obsession, archness, chauvinism, treating the whole world as your confessional); he is just more direct and macho about it; that fact, and the very different crowd surrounding his medium is enough to earn him contempt rather than mockery. (And contempt is a kind of involuntary respect.) Backwards analogy: Bukowski is Tom Waits minus gospel, minus FX pedals, minus Brecht and Weill, minus one steady Kathleen peer. And minus metre of course. A grumpy adolescent old man; a sensitising misanthrope; a beautiful lech.\r\n\r\nHe has only two modes: midnight countercultural raving and laconic woke-at-noon observation. Neither would work without his lecherousness and/or meanness and/or arrogance; they are the absolutely necessary breve before he blares out his concern.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    moments of agony and moments of glory\r\n    march across my roof.\r\n\r\n    the cat walks by\r\n    seeming to know everything.\r\n\r\n    my luck has been better, I think,\r\n    than the luck of the cut gladiolus,\r\n    although I am not sure.\r\n\r\n    I have been loved by many women,\r\n    and for a hunchback of life,\r\n    that’s lucky.\r\n\r\n    so many fingers pushing through my hair\r\n    so many arms holding me close\r\n    so many shoes thrown carelessly on my bedroom\r\n    rug.\r\n\r\n    so many searching hearts\r\n    now fixed in my memory that\r\n    i’ll go to my death,\r\n    remembering.\r\n    I have been treated better than I should have\r\n    been—\r\n    not by life in general\r\n    nor by the machinery of things\r\n    but by women.\r\n\r\n    but there have been other women\r\n    who have left me\r\n    standing in the bedroom alone\r\n    doubled over—\r\n    hands holding the gut—\r\n    thinking\r\n    why why why why why why?\r\n\r\n    women go to men who are pigs\r\n    women go to men with dead souls\r\n    women go to men who fuck badly\r\n    women go to shadows of men\r\n    women go\r\n    go\r\n    because they must go\r\n    in the order of\r\n    things.\r\n\r\n    the women know better\r\n    but often chose out of\r\n    disorder and confusion.\r\n\r\n    they can heal with their touch\r\n    they can kill what they touch and\r\n    I am dying\r\n    but not dead\r\n    yet.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n(That ^ might have gotten your back up, because it pattern-matches to modern whining about women's choices. But it isn't that: remember, from above, that he is calling himself a pig and a dead soul.)\r\n\r\nThis is three books written over thirty years, one sentence per ten lines as always, stapled together to give the impression of a late-life opus. It covers the whole lot: his Great Depression origin myth; his meaningless, crabbed middle years; and his long, long late period spent in contempt of the arty people who pay and applaud him.\r\n\r\nI am nothing like him, except maybe in sense of humour. He is not anti-modern - grew up through the Great Depression, a simulation of pre-modern subsistence; loves shit cars; lives for late night recorded music - but science, growth, and the expanding circle give him nothing of the sense of direction, transcendence and hope that it gives to me and mine. But still I \"relate\", as the disgusting verb puts it.\r\n\r\nI have read this a half-dozen times in a dozen years. (It isn't hard; it takes an hour.) I know of no better poet to <i>begin</i> to explain why poetry is good and unique and feeds life. This surely says something about my character, but I don't expect to stop reading it.\r\n\r\n<br> \r\nPS: Bukowski's epitaph is \"<i>Don't try</i>\". On the face of it that's mean and funny and fine, but it also means what Yoda means by it: Don't force it; Don't betray your nature; Do only what you are absolutely aligned behind. Is that good advice? Maybe not, but it is epitomises the man more than the nihilistic joke.\r\n\r\n<ul><li>    <a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Galef type</a>:<br>\r\n<i>Values 3</i> - written from a holistic value structure, letting you experience that value structure from the inside.\r\n</li>",

So relax and talk about the 'virtual' book, the idea of it, the version of it that you and your interlocutor inadvertently generate between you.\n\nThe title sounds like vacuous click-bait (indeed, a friend who later wrote his thesis on Bayard initially thought I was recommending something like this fluff). But it is instead all of the following: a thrilling act of virtuoso postmodern over-reading, a serious look at intellectual status and neurosis, a really interesting phenomenology of books, a glowing review of a dozen writers (including my beloved-but-low-status Greene and Lodge), and sheer backwards-land satire.\n\nI found it liberating, not because I go round pretending to have read things (a free-rider in literary conversations), but because by the end of my arts degree I had found out, to my surprise and dismay, that high culture is 90% bollocks. Or, maybe: that arts culture is shallow and irrational, a thick and grasping vine overgrowing the lovely lonely tower of great writing and painting.\n\nBayard (or anyway his cheeky narrator) help unhook you from the blind devotion of the reading classes, and lets you face books on your own terms, sceptical and skimming and agentic. I was freed - and immediately started to get technical.\n\nAnd 'Bayard's' style - pointing out the inconvenient but undeniable things about a cherished phenomenon - now reminds me of the arch-rationalist Robin Hanson. Which is where I went next.\n\n<ul><li>    <a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Galef type</a>: <br>\n\n    Values 2 - thought experiments for you to reflect on how you feel about something, &\n\n    Style 2 - learn a style of thinking by studying the author’s approach to the world Style 3 - tickle your aesthetic sense in a way that obliquely makes you a more interesting, generative thinker\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n",

I told him I would not allow that, because we would lose the central metaphor of the film. ‘Metaphor for what?’ he asked. I said I did not know, just that it was a grand metaphor. Maybe, I said, it was an image slumbering in all of us, and I happened to be the one to introduce him to a brother he had never met… \r\nhe said he could not go working under these conditions, and wanted to leave.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nI have a weird relationship with Herzog. His films’ typical tone and message (Nietzschean tragicomedy) doesn't really appeal to me. I watch them – and I watch them all, even since <i><a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dinotasia/#contentReviews\">Dinotasia</a></i> – for their literal and figurative voice: his relentless, Teutonic ecstatic absurdity. I wait for that voice to roll out and make me hurt or laugh. \r\n\r\n(Since his humour is only sometimes on show, I am often laughing at him – and yet, out of mawkish brutalism, through my irony, rise the most affecting scenes I’ve ever seen: the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdOmH1SgZsc \">beach shot</a> in Cobra Verde; the clouds in Heart of Glass; the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWH_9VRWn8Y\">wandering penguin </a>in Encounters; above all the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PLnDyVJzU38?t=12m20s \">final shot</a> of My Best Fiend.)\r\n\r\nThese diaries show him to be more thoughtful, rational, contrived and poetic than I had guessed. His sincere interest in the locals’ territorial plight, his physical participation in the set construction and management, his absorption in the suffering of jungle animals, his incongruous bright-eyed interest in mathematics, his astonishing codependency with Kinski, are all deeply disarming. The prose takes some getting used to, since the plain unflinching goth awe of it is the kind of thing we are primed to mock. \r\n<blockquote><i>The jungle is obscene. Everything about it is sinful, for which reason the sin does not stand out as sin. The voices in the jungle are silent; nothing is stirring, and a languid, immobile anger hovers over everything.</blockquote></i>\r\nIt is worth acclimating to: each entry is both bleak and hilarious, and Krishna Winston's translation is a thing of wonder, no doubt improving on WH. \r\n<blockquote><i>I recall experiencing a similar shiver of awe as a child in Sachrang, when I found a fried piece of bright blue plastic that had floated down the brook and got caught on an over hanging branch. At the time, I had never seen anything like it, and I kept it hidden for weeks, licked it, found it slightly stretchy, full of miraculous properties. Not until weeks later, when I had my fill of owning it, did I show it to anyone. Till and I discovered when you held a burning match to it, it melted; it gave black smoke and a nasty smell, but it was something we had never seen before, an emissary from a distant world high in the mountains, along the upper reaches of the brook, where it vanished into gorges and there were no people. So where did it come from? Had it blown into the mountains by the wind? Idid not know, but I gave the plastic a name-what I do not recall. I do know it had a nice sound, and was very secret, and since then I have often racked my brains, trying to remember that name, that word. I would give a lot to know it, but I do not, and I also do not have that delicate piece of weather-beaten plastic anymore. Having neither the secret word nor the plastic makes me poorer today than I was as a child.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nHe certainly views the natural world right: as overwhelmingly a place of horrifying and pointless suffering, cooed over by pseuds from cars. \r\n<blockquote><i>Sweat, storm clouds overhead, sleeping dogs. There is a smell of stale urine. In my soup, ants and bugs were swimming among the globules of fat. Lord Almighty, send us an earthquake.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThere’s not a lot of technical info here, or explanations of the crew’s role or background; there's no timeline or context added; nor even very much about the film at all. But who cares? This is incredible as nature writing, dream journal, and logistical poetry.\r\n",

    "review": "What to say?\r\n\r\nFifty fragments: unintegrated, contradicting, only sometimes amazing. Themes you’d expect: self-consciousness, freedom, duty, routine - the awful effect of unconstrained self-consciousness, freedom, duty and routine - the death of American civics - ‘the horror of personal smallness and transience’ - the repugnance we feel for pure virtue - the extraordinary fires alight beneath some people. But where in <i>Jest</i> these were expressed through (burdened with) drug slang, pharmacology, advertising dreck, and calculus, here we get accountancy minutiae surely intended to repulse us. Yet the style is far less mannered than his finished work, which style we might call Postdoc Valleyspeak.\r\n<blockquote><i>The reason for this public ignorance is not secrecy. The real reason why US citizens were/are not aware of these conflicts, changes and stakes is that the whole subject of tax policy and administration is dull. Massively, spectacularly dull. \r\n\r\nIt is impossible to overstate the importance of this feature. Consider, from the Service’s perspective, the advantages of the dull, the arcane, the mind-numbingly complex. The IRS was one of the very first government agencies to learn that such qualities help to insulate them against public protest and political opposition, and that abstruse dullness is actually a much more effective shield than is secrecy. For the great disadvantage of secrecy is that it’s interesting.</blockquote></i>\r\nInstitutional tedium – the default state for developed-world adults – is profoundly important to address, a topic it will take an unusual mind to illuminate for us. But <i>Pale King</i> is actually not a Kafkan tale of the ever-growing horror of bureaucracy; actually he is deeply impressed and convinced of the value of the people and the work of the IRS, in large part <i>because</i> of its inhumane strictures, lack of glory, and unpopularity.\r\n\r\n\"<i>Big Q is whether IRS is to be essentially a corporate entity or a moral one.</i>\" (Though if ‘corporate’ is there read merely as meaning ‘maximising’, the distinction can be misleading.)\r\n<blockquote> <i>To me, the really interesting question is why dullness proves to be such a powerful impediment to attention. Why we recoil from the dull. Maybe it’s because dullness is intrinsically painful; maybe that’s where phrases like ‘deadly dull’ and ‘excruciatingly dull’ come from. But there might be more to it. Maybe dullness is associated with psychic pain because something that’s dull fails to provide enough stimulation to distract people from some other, deeper type of pain that is always there, if only in an ambient low-level way… I can’t think anyone really believes that today’s so-called ‘information society’ is just about information. Everyone knows it’s about something else, way down.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nI tried to read them as short stories rather than chapters. This half-works. Actually the entire book was intentionally fruitless – the major agonists all off-stage, everyone else just enduring. \r\n\r\nA couple of intentionally unconvincing first-person authorial inserts – “I, David Wallace, social security no…” – affirm the reality of the garish IRS underbelly he fabricates, put him in the scene. Fragment #8 is a horrifying Cormac McCarthy lyric, childhood psychosis. One (#22) is a hundred-page monologue, the character repetitive, rambling and conceited, but also the most developed and affecting. Of this wreckage we are given to read. \r\nWhat to say? That you’d have to love this writing to like it, that you should.",

A solid effort too - it knows and guesses and connects more than most critics today, despite the scene being far more ethnically closed, and far less obviously of artistic wealth; despite their often comically mishearing the lyrics; and despite not being able to find anything out about the people behind the music, because no-one returned their calls (until they pretended to be journalists).\r\n \r\nAnyway this has 80pp of recognisably enervated DFW popping off the top of this allocortex, decent fuel for the fire of an admirer, or at any rate the only coal on offer (he was embarrassed by this book, but it is too stylish and enthusiastic to be embarrassing to us):\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nIronies abound, of course, as ironies must when cash and art do lunch. Tearing down the prop-thin symbolic walls, Run-DMC aim to celebrate desegregation, but miss the fact that Aerosmith, those whitest of white rockers, are merely big-budget Led Zeppelin ripoffs, and that Led Zep came straight outta the jet-black Rhythm & Blues of Chicago’s Chess Records. Dancing with Steve Tyler, Run-DMC forgets that Muddy Waters’ sideman Willie Dixon had to sue Led Zeppelin to get proper credit for their use of his blues. “Walk This Way” is an unwanted reunion of 80s black street music with part of its rich heritage, as that heritage has been mined and mongrelized by Show Biz. If this is desegregation, then shopping malls hold treasure...\r\n\r\nIt’s a new and carnivorous kind of mimesis that makes weary old ‘self-reference’ actually kind of interesting, because it enlarges Self from the standard rock-subjective–a bundle of hormone-drenched emotions attached to a larynx and pelvis–to a 'big ole head,’ a kind of visual street-corner, a monadic Everybrother, an angry, jaded eye on a centerless pop-culture country full of marginalized subnations that are themselves postmodern, looped, self-referential, self-obsessed, voyeuristic, passive, slack-jawed, debased, and sources of such prodigious signal-and-data bombardment that they seem to move faster than the angry eye itself can see…</i></blockquote>\r\nI had been putting off reading this because of the title: I didn't know about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-PxCWwu5kQ\">Schooly D</a>'s track, so I read the verb in a gross academic voice (\"in which we give rappers true signification\") rather than the adjectival sense they actually meant (\"rappers who signify\").\r\nCostello's bits are ok, DJ \"MC\" to MC \"DFW\". Wallace is harder than Costello - noting that MCs really are just yuppies, that Chuck D's claims to not be glorifying violence are absurd, that part of the fascination of hard rap is the snuff-spiral of trying to be nastier and nastier than previous hard rappers, which is just the commercial impulse of Alice Cooper minus musicianship. But this is also a winning early bet: that rap is poetry, that it was and would be \"the decade's most important and influential pop movement\":\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>Our opinion, then, from a distance: not only is serious rap poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great U.S. Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we’ve been encouraged sadly to write off, it’s quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. ‘Real’ (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocal, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn’t get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers..</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nYour enjoyment will depend on you giving a crap about the sheer horror of rap's initial context and being able to tolerate intentionally torturous pomo prose and juxtapositions (e.g. <i>I Dream of Jeannie</i> vs race riots). I loved it and twice missed my stop on the tube reading it.\r\n\r\n[<a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Data #1, Theory #1, Values #1, Thinking #2</a>]</li>\r\n",

A faith is not acquired; it grows like a tree.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nForeword, by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Crossman\">a peculiarly intellectual MP</a> (by today's standards), is careful to set itself apart from the red-bashing of the time and lay out its humane purpose: to understand the emotional appeal of communism (: a religious one) and the disillusionment that the very most independent communists had already suffered. \r\n<blockquote><i>no one who has not wrestled with Communism as a philosophy, and Communists as political opponents, can really understand the values of Western democracy. The Devil once lived in Heaven, and those who have not met him are unlikely to recognize an angel when they see one... The Communist novice, subjecting his soul to the canon law of the Kremlin, felt something of the release which Catholicism also brings to the intellectual, wearied and worried by the privilege of freedom.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nSilone's testimony about the Comintern's sick irrationality would be enough to make the book prescient. Richard Wright's account of the fucked-up parties outside Russia is another really chilling bit: the rot was deep and wide.

    "review": "Believe me that it's remarkable; it's easily in the top 5 most insightful books out of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/68316850-gavin-leech?shelf=read\">the 500</a> I have reviewed here. I called <i>Superintelligence</i> the most rigorous exploration of the nonreal I had ever read: this beats it by a lot. You will find yourself reading pages on the properties of coolant pipes and be utterly engrossed. It is imaginary sociology, imaginary economics, <i>real</i> fiction. \r\n\r\n(But it lacks an ethnography entirely: no em speaks to us themselves.)\r\n\r\nPeople tend to wrap <i>Age of Em</i> in ulterior motives and esoteric intentions, because they love it but see futurism as an unworthy goal for such an achievement. I am no different: this is the greatest compendium of real social science I have ever found.\r\n\r\nNo review can do much justice, but here's one particularly hair-raising point in it: Hanson surveys the whole course of human history, and notes the many ways our culture is unprecedented and, in the evolutionary sense, nonadaptive:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>we live in the brief but important “dreamtime” when delusions [drive] history.  Our descendants will remember our era as the one where the human capacity to sincerely believe crazy non-adaptive things, and act on those beliefs, was dialed to the max.\r\n\r\nWhy is our era so delusory?\r\n\r\n    <ol>\r\n<li>Our knowledge has been growing so fast, and bringing such radical changes, that many of us see anything as possible, so that nothing can really be labeled delusion.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>    Rich folks like us have larger buffers of wealth to cushion our mistakes; we can live happily and long even while acting on crazy beliefs.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>    We humans evolved to signal various features of ourselves to one another via delusions; we usually think that the various things we do to signal are done for other reasons.  For example, we think we pay for docs to help our loved ones get well, rather than to show that we care.  We think we do politics because we want to help our nation, rather than to signal our character and loyalty.  We are overconfident in our abilities in order to convince others to have confidence in us, and so on.  But while our ancestors’ delusions were well adapted to their situations, and so didn’t hurt them much, the same delusions are not nearly as adapted to our rapidly changing world; our signaling induced delusions hurt us more.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>    Humans seem to have evolved to emphasize signaling more in good times than in bad.  Since very few physical investments last very long, the main investments one can make in good times that last until bad times are allies and reputation. So we are built to, in good times, spend more time and energy on leisure, medicine, charity, morals, patriotism, and so on.  Relative to our ancestors’ world, our whole era is one big very good time.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>    Our minds were built with a near mode designed more for practical concrete reasoning about things up close, and a far mode designed more for presenting a good image to others via our abstract reasoning about things far away.  But our minds must now deal with a much larger world where many relevant things are much further away, and abstract reasoning is more useful.  So we rely more than did our ancestors on that abstract far mode capability.  But since that far mode was tuned more for presenting a good image, it is much more tolerant of good-looking delusions.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>    Tech now enables more exposure to mood-altering drugs and arts, and specialists make them into especially potent “super-stimuli.”... today drugs are cheap, we can hear music all the time, most surfaces are covered by art, and we spend much of our day with stories from TV, video games, etc.  And all that art is made by organized groups of specialists far better than the typical ancestral artist.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>    We were built to be influenced by the rhetoric, eloquence, difficulty, drama, and repetition of arguments, not just their logic.  Perhaps this once helped us to ally us with high status folks.  And we were built to show our ideals via the stories we like, and also to like well-crafted stories.  But today we are exposed to arguments and stories by folks far more expert than found in ancestral tribes.  Since we are built to be quite awed and persuaded by such displays, our beliefs and ideals are highly influenced by our writers and story-tellers.  And these folks in turn tell us what we want to hear, or what their patrons want us to hear, neither of which need have much to do with reality.\r\n</li></ol>\r\n\r\nThese factors combine to make our era the most consistently and consequentially deluded and unadaptive of any era ever.  When they remember us, our distant descendants will be shake their heads at the demographic transition, where we each took far less than full advantage of the reproductive opportunities our wealth offered.  They will note how we instead spent our wealth to buy products we saw in ads that talked mostly about the sort of folks who buy them.  They will lament our obsession with super-stimuli that highjacked our evolved heuristics to give us taste without nutrition.   They will note we spent vast sums on things that didn’t actually help on the margin, such as on medicine that didn’t make us healthier, or education that didn’t make us more productive.\r\n\r\nOur descendants will also remember our adolescent and extreme mating patterns, our extreme gender personalities, and our unprecedentedly fierce warriors.  They will be amazed at the strange religious, political, and social beliefs we acted on, and how we preferred a political system, democracy, designed to emphasize the hardly-considered fleeting delusory thoughts of the median voter rather than the considered opinions of our best experts.\r\n\r\nPerhaps most important, our descendants may remember how history hung by a precarious thread on a few crucial coordination choices that our highly integrated rapidly changing world did or might have allowed us to achieve, and the strange delusions that influenced such choices.  These choices might have been about global warming, rampaging robots, nuclear weapons, bioterror, etc.  Our delusions may have led us to do something quite wonderful, or quite horrible, that permanently changed the options available to our descendants.  This would be the most lasting legacy of this, our explosively growing dream time, when what was once adaptive behavior with mostly harmless delusions become strange and dreamy unadaptive behavior, before adaptation again reasserted a clear-headed relation between behavior and reality.\r\n\r\nOur dreamtime will be a time of legend, a favorite setting for grand fiction, when low-delusion heroes and the strange rich clowns around them could most plausibly have changed the course of history.  Perhaps most dramatic will be tragedies about dreamtime advocates who could foresee and were horrified by the coming slow stable adaptive eons, and tried passionately, but unsuccessfully, to prevent them.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt's easy to read a radical critique of our liberal values in there, but I believe him when he says that he doesn't dislike dreamtime; he just predicts it cannot last, because we are fighting an old and inexorable tide.\r\n\r\nThere are several thoughts this large, and a thousand other small insights in <i>Age of Em</i>.",

    "review": "Marvelous. Even though: nearly filled-up with resentment and self-pity. Patrick's staggering detachment from and humour about his own inner life makes the books rise far above him - most of the series is not spent in Patrick's head but instead depicts his brutal gilded circle - and, every few pages, there is a moment of beautiful lucidity or unvoiced empathy. The prose, the humour, the sadness are enough to make you glad, with Patrick, that his parents are dead.\n\nThe prose is wonderfully smooth, but I took my time, jolted out every few pages by something demanding reflection: \"Evil is sickness celebrating itself\";\n\n<blockquote>\n    Just as a novelist may sometimes wonder why he invents characters who do not exist and makes them do things which do not matter, so a philosopher may wonder why he invents cases that cannot occur in order to determine what must be the case. \n</blockquote>\n\nUnderneath the filth and irony, Patrick is someone for whom philosophical questions are natural and urgent. The long discursions are more motivated and seamless than in any novel I can think of.\n\nAt one point, Mary dismisses the idea that her son's anxiety and angst, so like his father's, could have a genetic component - and assumes that it has inadvertently leaked out of Patrick's behaviour. (She goes on to leave him, actually making a damage-control argument about removing the children from his helpless influence.)\n\nYes: For all his insight, wit, cynicism, contrarianism, St Aubyn is still stuck in a giant contemporary ideology: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurture_Assumption\">nurture assumption</a>, the culture of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_genetics#Genetic_influences_on_behaviour_are_pervasive\">environment-only development</a> and essential woundedness.\n\nSure, people get wounded all the time, and being able to say so in public is a great gain, (for one thing, no one in a confessional culture has to assume that they are alone, that their defects are bizarrely theirs. But if trauma is the centre of some people's sense of self - if it is fetishised and even incentivised (e.g. misery memoirs and high-clap Medium posts)... The risks of centring such things are large and underreported: self-fulfilling prophecies, agonising rumination, and the loss of the peace and pleasure of gratitude.\n\nFine, Aubyn is correct about our sad path-dependence - he's just too recent in placing the start of the path. <a href=\"www.wfsbp.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Treatment_Guidelines/Biological_markers_for_anxiety_disorders_OCD_and_PTSD_a_consensus_statement_Part_I_Neuroimaging_and_genetics.pdf\">Here are genetic markers</a> for anxiety and PTSD, against the novel's tacit, almost Freudian emphasis on environment alone.\n\nAubyn is obviously somewhat detached from his own trauma - you can't write prose this fair and glowing if you're not - which is lucky. Otherwise, the seeker after truth would be senselessly telling the vulnerable they're deluded about their own life. (As we all are, though not in the same ways.)\n\n\n*\nSerious engagement with philosophy of mind throughout:\n\n<blockquote>\n    In any case, he now felt in danger all the time. Danger of liver collapse, marital breakdown, terminal fear. Nobody ever died of a feeling, he would say to himself, not believing a word of it, as he sweated his way through the feeling that he was dying of fear. People died of feelings all the time, once they had gone through the formality of materializing them into bullets and bottles and tumours. \n</blockquote>\n\nMore generally, Patrick actually wrestles with materialism, rather than using the usual literary tricks of caricature and omission on it.\n\n*\n\nCurious whether St Aubyn got his vicious rendition of Princess Margaret at <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n01/ferdinand-mount/always-the-same-dream\">first- or second-hand</a>.\n\n*\n\nThe first three chapters of Mother's Milk, told from the perspective of Patrick's first child, are just perfect writing. Robert sees only the benevolence and humour of his parents, not their exhaustion, rage, and bad faith. They are anonymous to him and us, just Robert's mother and Robert's father. It is a glory and a high echelon, though it gives giving the emotional arc of the rest of the book a very long way to fall.\n<blockquote>\n    Thomas [2 years old] still knew how to understand the silent language which Robert had almost lost as the wild margins of his mind fell under the sway of a verbal empire. He was standing on a ridge, about to surge downhill, getting faster, getting taller, getting more words, getting bigger and bigger explanations, cheering all the way. Now Thomas had made him glance backwards and lower his sword for a moment while he noticed everything he had lost as well. He had become so caught up in building sentences that he had almost forgotten the barbaric days when thinking was like a splash of colour on a page. \n</blockquote>\n\nThe exaggeration of the wisdom of children is even stronger in Mother's Milk. This is no criticism because St Aubyn isn't very committed to realism, and because Robert's rich and sparkling inner life suits one of the themes: that children deserve to be treated well, taken relatively seriously, as we all do. And that purpose is not the same as result ('telos' indeed):\n\n<blockquote>\n    We think the purpose of a child is to grow up because it does grow up. But its purpose is to play, to enjoy itself, to be a child. If we merely look to the end of the process, the purpose of life is death. \n</blockquote>\nThe art of kintsugi. ",

    "review": "Irritating but righteous. Not quite what it looks like: another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/apr/07/society\">Ronson</a>-<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Call-Weird-Travels-American-Subcultures/dp/0330435701\">Theroux</a> journalist, accosting another set of tragicomic kooks). \r\n\r\nOK, it <i>is</i> that, but it's also a grim reflection on how confusing and muddy the world is, on the universality of extreme bias - plus dollops of Storr's personal traumas and peccadilloes. (Half the book is his confessing to childhood theft, psychosis, academic failure, and petty vendettas.) Rather than getting to the bottom of ESP, or morgellons, or homeopathy, or past-life regression, Storr tries to understand the character of the people who believe and disbelieve in them.\r\n\r\nBesides confronting unusual beliefs without (as much) prejudice, <i>The Heretics</i> is about coming to terms with the fact that we are all riddled with deep obstacles to objectivity: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups\">ingroupism</a> and confirmation bias; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_and_indirect_realism\">representation realism</a>; emotional reasoning; the terrifyingly unreliable <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_memory\">reconstructive</a> nature of memory; the sad <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rationality-versus-intelligence?barrier=accessreg\">nonidentity of intelligence and rationality</a>; evolutionarily adaptive delusions of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias\">superiority</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515089.2016.1219030\">agency</a>. These are illustrated by interviews with a <a href=\"https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/John_Mackay\">creationist</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Sheldrake\">Sheldrake</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving\">Irving</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramdev\">Ramdev</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Monckton,_3rd_Viscount_Monckton_of_Brenchley\">Monckton</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgellons\">Morgellons</a> victims*, and even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi\">Randi</a>.\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    Stories work against truth. They operate with the machinery of prejudice and distortion. Their purpose is not fact but propaganda. The scientific method is the tool that humans have developed to break the dominion of the narrative. It has been designed specifically to dissolve anecdote, to strip out emotion and leave only unpolluted data. It is a new kind of language, a modern sorcery, and it has gifted our species incredible powers. We can eradicate plagues, extend our lives by decades, build rockets and fly through space. But we can hardly be surprised if some feel an instinctive hostility towards it, for it is fundamentally inhuman.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nStorr is seriously out of his depth on the science: he is always at least second-hand from the evidence (when interviewing researchers), and often third-hand (most of his citations are pop science books), and so several chapters suffer from journalism's classic problem, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGArqoF0TpQ\">false balance</a>. The reason this isn't a call to shut the book is because he doesn't spare himself, states this repeatedly - and this is in fact <i>the theme</i> of his book: that almost all of us are unable to infer the truth about a shocking diversity of things.*\r\n\r\nFor instance, not just the past-life cranks, but also the Skeptics he encounters are out of their depth, and deserve the calling-out they get from him. No one can think they're past the need for doubt.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>I am surprised, for a start, that so few of these disciples of empirical evidence seem to be familiar with the scientific literature on the subject that impassions them so. I am suspicious, too, about the real source of their rage. If they are motivated, as they frequently insist, by altruistic concern over the dangers of supernatural belief, why don't they obsess over jihadist Muslims, homophobic Christians or racist Jewish settlers? Why this focus on stage psychics, ghosthunters and alt-med hippies?\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>During our conversation, I asked Randi if he has ever, in his life, changed his position on anything due to an examination of the evidence. After a long silence, he said, 'That's a good question. I have had a few surprises along the way that got my attention rather sharply.' \r\n&nbsp; 'What were these?' I asked. \r\nHe thought again, for some time. 'Oh, some magic trick that I decided on the modus operandi.'...\r\n'So you’ve never been wrong about anything significant?'\r\n'In regard to the Skeptical movement and my work...' There was another stretched and chewing pause. He conferred with his partner, to see if he had any ideas. 'No. Nothing occurs to me at the moment.'\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nThat's not how memory works though, is it? \r\n\r\nEven given his unusual humility, Storr is too literal-minded and prosecutorial (\"<i>I have been looking for evidence that James Randi is a liar</i>\"). Storr is disillusioned with particular Skeptics, and reacts by throwing out scepticism:\r\n<blockquote><i> For many Skeptics, evidence-based truth has been sacralised. It has caused them to become irrational in their judgements of the motives of those with whom they do not agree...\r\nThis monoculture we would have, if the hard rationalists had their way, would be a deathly thing. So bring on the psychics, bring on the alien abductees, bring on the two John Lennons – bring on a hundred of them. Christians or no, there will be tribalism. Televangelists or no, there will be scoundrels. It is not religion or fake mystics that create these problems, it is being human. Where there is illegality or racial hatred, call the police. Where there is psychosis, call Professor Richard Bentall. Where there is misinformation, bring learning. But where there is just ordinary madness, we should celebrate. Eccentricity is our gift to one another. It is the riches of our species. To be mistaken is not a sin. Wrongness is a human right.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nAnd when Randi corrects himself in the course of a sentence (\"<i>I didn't go to grade school at all, I went to the first few grades of grade school</i>\"), Storr leaps on this as a serious contradiction rather than just the patchy nature of speech. Sure, he talks about his emotional bias against scepticism - but he still leaves in this idiot journo behaviour, the uncharitable coaxing out of flaws.\r\n\r\nThese chapters were a good ethnography of '<a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Traditional_rationality\">traditional</a>' <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WeQv9LSCj9nYXoTwJ/what-is-wrong-with-traditional-rationality\">(nontechnical) rationality</a>. But Storr doesn't know about the other kind (which both foregrounds and copes with all the cognitive biases he is so struck and scarred by), and so his conclusion about rationalism is completely awry.**\r\n\r\nThe title is fitting in a few ways: Storr sees these people as persecuted underdogs (he likes many of the quacks and fringeists, and so focusses on the arrogance and bias of the - however correct - mainstream figures dealing with them); and they certainly have the holy madness of people who cry out despite knowing they will be ostracised. \r\n<blockquote><i>Over the last few months, John E Mack has become a kind of hero to me. Despite his earlier caution, he ended up believing in amazing things: intergalactic space travel and terrifying encounters in alien craft that travelled seamlessly through nonphysical dimensions. And when his bosses tried to silence him, he hired a lawyer. He fought back against the dean and his dreary minions. He battled hard in the name of craziness...\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nDavid Irving is interesting in this regard: he does not act like a fraud (e.g. he sues people for libel, even though this brings intensive scrutiny of his research), but rather a sort of compulsive masochist-contrarian. Stranger still, his (beloved) family were all solid anti-Nazi soldiers in WWII. (Storr contorts himself to explain Irving's identification with Hitler as due to their sharing an admiration of the British forces (...)) \r\n\r\nStorr's awful experience on a Vipassana retreat is a vivid example of the Buddhist <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/the-dark-knight-of-the-souls/372766/\">dark night of the soul</a>. We don't know what fraction of people suffer terribly from meditation, but despite its <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/23/1064082990875.html\">cuddly image</a>, there's surely large overlap with the <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254610/WHO-MSD-MER-2017.2-eng.pdf;jsessionid=C7A88D6AF4B91BEB0EBF7EA1A65E2671?sequence=1\">8% of people</a> who are clinically depressive and/or anxious.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on psi does not represent <a href=\"http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/2011/WagenmakersEtAl2011_JPSP.pdf\">the state</a> <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033423\">of evidence</a> <a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2011/01/06/that_silly_esp/\">properly</a> - perhaps because one of his proof-readers was <a href=\"https://slate.com/health-and-science/2017/06/daryl-bem-proved-esp-is-real-showed-science-is-broken.html\">Professor Daryl Bloody Bem</a>. ***\r\n\r\nThe ending is stirring but tilts over into relativism:\r\n<blockquote><i>The Skeptic tells the story of Randi the hero; the psychic of Randi the devil. We all make these unconscious plot decisions...\r\n\r\nWe are all creatures of illusion. We are made out of stories. From the heretics to the Skeptics, we are all lost in our own secret worlds. \r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nBut the question is to what <i>degree</i>! And the degree of lostness, of inverse rationality, varies by many orders of whatever magnitude you wish to pick.\r\n\r\nStorr's disquiet at the sheer power of cognitive bias, and the systematic failures of yes/no science (that is: statistical significance rather than effect size estimation) is well and good.  (<a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2017/06/29/lets-stop-talking-published-research-findings-true-false/\">Gelman</a>: \r\n<blockquote><i>I think ‘the probability that a model or a hypothesis is true’ is generally a meaningless statement except as noted in certain narrow albeit important examples.</i></blockquote>.) \r\nAnd his humane approach is certainly bound to be more compelling to mystics and flakes than e.g. deGrasse Tyson's smug dismissals. But Storr is scared of grey, of the fact that doubt is only reducible and not eliminable. This is because he doesn't know anything about our most beautiful weapons: probabilism, Bayesian inference, Analysis. \r\n\r\nI recommend <i><a href=\"http://elephantinthebrain.com/\">Elephant in the Brain</a></i> or <i><a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/\">Rationality from A to Z</a></i> instead as an approach to the vital, dreadful side of cognition (including advice on avoiding being a fake, partial, traditional sceptic); they have less angst and false equivalences, and were written by people who understand the balance of evidence. \r\n\r\nActually that's too strong; I am frustrated with Storr because he is so similar to me, except he doesn't grasp that the technical is the path out of (many) biases. There's a lot wrong with it and you should probably read it, and how often can one say that?\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n* Storr is right that skeptics can lack compassion. The \"Morgellons\" people <i>are</i> victims regardless of what their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology\">etiology</a> turns out to be (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusional_parasitosis\">mental illness</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formication\">nerve disorders</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithonyssus_bacoti\">tropical rat mites</a>, or yes malicious sentient fibres). At minimum, they are victims of bad fortune plus rigid and actually unscientific medical practices. The Lesswrong style of rationalist has less of this problem IMO (more emotional literacy; a more Californian culture).\r\n\r\n** Storr:\r\n<blockquote><i>    I am concerned that I have overstated my argument. In my haste to write my own coherent story, I have barely acknowledged the obvious truth that minds do sometimes change. People find faith and they lose it. Mystics become Skeptics. Politicians cross the floor. I wonder why this happens. Is it when the reality of what is actually happening in our lives overpowers the myth that we make of themselves? Are we simply pursuing ever more glorious hero missions?...\r\n\r\nThis is an imperfect system, as it relies on many secondary sources. Moreover, I do not declare myself to be free of the biases that afflict any writer, and I'm certainly not immune to making mistakes. If any errors are noted, or if new findings supersede claims made in the text, I would be very grateful to receive notification via willstorr.com, so future editions can be corrected.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Important caveat to the headline of that linked article from Gelman:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nThe only thing I don’t like about Engber’s article is its title, “Daryl Bem Proved ESP Is Real. Which means science is broken.” I understand that “Daryl Bem Proved ESP Is Real” is kind of a joke, but to me this is a bit too close to the original reporting on Bem, back in 2011, where people kept saying that Bem’s study was high quality, state-of-the-art psychology, etc. Actually, Bem’s study was crap. It’s every much as bad as the famously bad papers on beauty and sex ratio, ovulation on voting, elderly-related words and slow walking, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd “science” is not broken. Crappy science is broken. Good science is fine. If “science” is defined as bad articles published in PPNAS—himmicanes, air rage, ages ending in 9, etc.—then, sure, science is broken. But if science is defined as the real stuff, then, no, it’s not broken at all. \r\n</i></blockquote>",

    "review": "Addictive horrible hilarious biographies of British folly, banality and sin. A thousand years of tabloid gossip and popular madness, events too ephemeral for most serious historians: degradation, unchecked insanity and petty cruelty. But incredibly funny. The biographies are spaced out by Donaldson's wonderful little hooks, dry sentences that lead one on a wiki-walk:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n* <li type=\"circle\"><i>ears, bagfuls of drying</li>\r\n* <li type=\"circle\">universes, privileged to be part of a team working in many</li>\r\n* <li type=\"circle\">drinking 'brain damage' while composing a speech for Michael Heseltine</li>\r\n* <li type=\"circle\">coal merchants, remarkable</li>\r\n* <li type=\"circle\">voluptuous Tartars and tun-bellied Chinese</li>\r\n* <li type=\"circle\">dog on a diet of cats, feeding one's 12-stone</li>\r\n* <li type=\"circle\">soft heart and 83 previous convictions, a</i></li></ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nHe has particular obsessions, and the book is organised around them: the fate of gays throughout British history; criminal priests, eccentric spinster aristocrats, the line of succession of London ganglords from Jonathan Wild onward; politicians doing what they ought not; the odd fates private schoolboys often find themselves in... Obviously this is no demerit in an unsystematic historian. The modern gang biographies attest to his personal acquaintance with the big diamond geezers (which makes him a \"silly bollocks\", a foolish gang dilettante). His wit's mostly very dry, on occasion boiling over into outrage:\r\n<blockquote><i>Dodd's execution took place at Tyburn on 27 June 1777 and the outcry it occasioned has  been recognized by some historians as a key moment in focusing public attention on the brutality of capital punishment. It seems more likely, however, that it was caused less by any  broad change in public opinion than by the fact Dodd was of the same class as those protesting his execution. A 15-year-old orphan, John Harris, hanged on the same day for  stealing two and half guineas, received no such support, least of all from Dr Johnson...\r\n\r\nUnder the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the law was changed to ensure that the production and supply of dangerous drugs should henceforth be in the hands of criminal organisations. Some people have argued that this is not an ideal arrangement.</i></blockquote>\r\nI made the mistake of trying to read it over one week - so the endless succession of 18th century rapist officers being instantly pardoned and/or their victims being arrested kind of ran together. It is actually the best bog book ever and wants 4 slow months. I understand Britain a lot better now. The author would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/25/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">emphatically deserve</a> an entry of his own in any future edition: astonishing wit, astonishing connections, astonishing potential, with little to show for it but a barrel of laughs and this.",

    "review": "<blockquote><i>Colleagues of mine will tell you that people despise critics because they fear our power. But I know better. People despise critics because people despise weakness, and criticism is the weakest thing you can do in writing. It is the written equivalent of air guitar—flurries of silent, sympathetic gestures with nothing at their heart but the memory of the music. It produces no knowledge, states no facts, and never stands alone. It neither saves the things we love (as we would wish them saved) nor ruins the things we hate. Edinburgh Review could not destroy John Keats, nor Diderot Boucher, nor Ruskin Whistler; and I like that about it. It’s a loser’s game, and everybody knows it.\n</i></blockquote>\n\nSome of the most pleasurable prose I've ever read. It's so good, I worry I'm being convinced of things I shouldn't be. Like, say, Chesterton he is besotted with paradoxes and the contrary. Like Chesterton he is more than good enough to outweigh his questionable opinions.\n\n<blockquote><i>\nit has always seemed to me that Rockwell and [Johnny] Mercer must certainly be important artists, not so much because people love them (although that is a part of it) but because I had learned so much from them—and because they both denied it so strenuously. Still, for a long time, I really didn’t know what kind of art they made, or what it did. I only knew that it wasn’t high art, which is defined by its context and its exclusivity—and is always, in some sense, about that context and that exclusivity.\n\nI decided that, if high art is always about context and exclusivity, the art of Rockwell and Mercer, which denies both with a vengeance, must be about that denial. To put it simply: Norman Rockwell’s painting, like Johnny Mercer’s music, has no special venue. It lives in the quotidian world with us amidst a million other things, so it must define itself as we experience it, embody itself and be remembered to survive. So it must rhyme, must live in pattern, which is the mother of remembering. Moreover, since this kind of art lacks any institutional guarantee of our attention, it must be selected by us—and since it aspires to be selected by all of us, it must accept and forgive us too—and speak the language of acceptance and forgiveness. And since it can only flourish in an atmosphere of generosity and agreement, it must somehow, in some way, promote that atmosphere.\n\nThus, there is in Rockwell (as there is in Dickens) this luminous devotion to the possibility of domestic kindness and social accord—along with an effortless proclivity to translate any minor discord into comedy and forgiving tristesse—and this domain of kindness and comedy and tristesse is not the truth, but it is a part of it, and a part that we routinely deny these days, lest we compromise our social agendas...\n\nThis is what he celebrates and insists upon: that “normal” life, in this country, is not normal at all—that we all exist in a general state of social and physical equanimity that is unparalleled in the history of humans. (Why else would we alert the media every time we feel a little bit blue?)\n</i></blockquote>\n\nThis book turned my head around. Here a lifelong art critic and practitioner disparages high art and its comparatively shallow theorists; glorifies Vegas, Liberace, and Norman Rockwell, and cries out for a little honest vulgarity, a little fun. He says confusing things about social identity which I still haven't quite unpicked. Here he tells us that his profession is pathetic, beneath us. Writing was not atop the world, and so the profession wasn't, and so...\n\n<blockquote><i>\nI see the object. I translate that seeing into vision. I encode that vision into language, and append whatever speculations and special pleadings I deem appropriate to the occasion. At this point, whatever I have written departs. It enters the historical past, perpetually absent from the present, and only represented there in type—while the visible artifact remains in the present moment—positively there, visually available for the length of its existence regardless of its antiquity—perpetually re-created by the novelty of its experiential context. As a consequence, what I write and what I have written about diverge from the moment of their confluence and never meet again.\n\nThe writing gets older with each passing moment while the artifact gets newer. There are works of art on the wall of my apartment, for instance, that I have written about in the past. They remain as fresh and devious today as the first day I set eyes upon them, invariably evoking the sense memory of that first bright encounter—while the words I wrote on that occasion, informed by that brightness, have yellowed into antiquity and seem to me now as weathered and grotesque as Dorian’s portrait. Thus, in the same sense that there is only historical writing, there is no historical art beyond those imaginary works that critics describe in writing.\n</i></blockquote>\n\nFrom high in the airy galleries of California I am shown earthiness, gratitude, poptimism, concreteness, and puncturing pretense. All in a format lacking in them or unsuited to them. He told me to get out of my head, and somehow I listened.\n\n<blockquote><i>\nThanks to Waylon {Jennings], as well, and to Willie Nelson, Bobby Bare, and Hank Williams, Jr. for their insights into the life and art of Hank Williams; and thank you to Isaiah Berlin, Jane Jacobs, Jacqueline Lichtenstein, Nathalie Sarraute, and Leo Steinberg\n</i></blockquote>\n\nHow is this book not known for what it is? How can an <i>academic</i> write like this?\n",

    "review": "I've been playing at knowing China for years, but of course I do not. (For instance, I picked this calm, modest book up unwittingly, and learn it is the gold standard translation by the greatest Western sinologist of the day.) It's a great hook: supposedly, Chinese poetry (world poetry?) peaked in the Ninth Century. For almost their whole history, passion and violence were considered inappropriate topics for poetry! They resented melodrama and fantasy in their poets! I must be jaded to think this is great. \r\n\r\nThe poets seem all to be old men trying not to care about death - \"snail shell men\", in Ancient Chinese. They are mainly ultra-concrete - lots of masterpieces about <a href=\"http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/extracts-from-south-mountains-by-han-yu.html\">mountains</a> and rice and fish. Graham is a droll, masterful guide, making the requisite comparisons to Baudelaire and Pound for me, the clunking reader. (I can only assume the strange meters he uses are good approximations to the original.) The war between Confucianism and Buddhism is prominent here, and is hard for me to imagine -probably because I have a Hollywood understanding of these two \"serene\" \"coping\" philosophies. Li Shangyin's (李商隐的) \"On a Monastery Wall\":  \r\n<blockquote> <i>They rejected life to seek the way.

(It covers such anti-scientific fields as alternative medicine, journalism, politics, and policy. You may regard anti-vaxxers, face cream 'science', homeopathy, and AIDS denialism as too obviously false to be worth your time deriding. But these hopeful, manipulative falsehoods are where many if not most live: someone has to defend people.)\r\n\r\nThis makes it a collection of a hundred enjoyable tutorials in statistics, experimental method, and epistemology:\r\n<blockquote><i>Alternative therapists don't kill many people, but they do make a great teaching tool for the basics of evidence-based medicine, because their efforts to distort science are so extreme. When they pervert the activities of people who should know better &#8211; medicines regulators, or universities &#8211; it throws sharp relief onto the role of science and evidence in culture...</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nGoldacre is a gifted populariser: by focussing on particular abuses, he is able to animate very hard and theoretical topics by leveraging our anger, or our humour. (In a similar way to Nassim Taleb's snark. Of course, as strict empiricists, the two men share many targets: the powerful and overconfident, the famed and hollow, the predatory and avaricious). Since <a href=\"http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/keep-libel-laws-out-of-science.html\">British libel law</a> opens him to constant financial hazard, <i>even when he is entirely careful and correct</i>, he calls his writing \"pop science with a gun to your head\". (Actually it is mostly pop metascience; even better. There are shout-outs to the great critics of C20th science: <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/309/6954/597\">Celia Mulrow</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/\">John Ioannidis</a>, <a href=\"http://datacolada.org/\">Uri Simonsohn</a>, who are too-rarely praised; for they turned on the people who might otherwise have lionised them.)\r\n\r\nHe shows policy analysis to be lagging a century behind the standard set by medical trials, and not mostly for the good reasons (which are: that they have a more <a href=\"https://pileusblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/02/the-causal-density-of-human-behavior/\">causally dense</a> subject than medicine has; and because they face absolute ethical restrictions on their experiments: it is politically impossible to experiment with welfare systems). e.g.: Policy people set <i>no</i> required evidence threshold before administering their treatments en masse, have no controls, no randomisation, no calibration, no statements of formal uncertainty, no malpractice system to punish their recklessness, nor often any honest fucking posthoc <i>evaluation</i> of their treatment.\r\n<blockquote>[Andrew Lansley's] <i>pretence at data-driven neutrality is not just irritating, it's also hard to admire. There's no need to hide behind a cloak of scientific authority, murmuring the word \"evidence\" into microphones. If your reforms are a matter of ideology, legacy, whim and faith, then, like many of your predecessors, you could simply say so, and leave \"evidence\" to people who mean it.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nJournalists come across as badly as the quacks - even BBC, Panorama, C4 News. This <i>may</i> be being ameliorated at last by the rise of the specialised blogospheres and by the Nate Silver / <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-map-us-police-killings\">Rich Harris</a> / <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/author/keithfray/\">Keith Frey</a> school of data journalism. But not generally yet and not for sure.\r\n\r\nI love <a href=\"http://www.badscience.net/2003/04/be-very-afraid-the-bad-science-manifesto/\">his rationalist war-cry</a>, against the public and dinner-party proponents of the never-supported <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine\">MMR </a>-autism link:\r\n<blockquote><i>Many of these people were hardline extremists - humanities graduates - who treated my arguments about evidence as if I were some kind of religious zealot, a purveyor of scientism, a fool to be pitied. The time had clearly come to mount a massive counter-attack.\r\n\r\n...nerds are more powerful than we know. Changing mainstream media will be hard, but you can help create parallel options. More academics should blog, post videos, post audio, post lectures, offer articles and more. You'll enjoy it: I've had threats and blackmail, abuse, smears and formal complaints with forged documentation. But it's worth it, for one simple reason: pulling bad science apart is the best teaching gimmick I know for explaining how good science works. I'm not a policeman, and I've never set out to produce a long list of what's right and what's wrong. For me, things have to be interestingly wrong, and the methods are all that matter.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.badscience.net/\">His website is a bit ugly</a> but has most of this content for free; the extras in this volume are oddities for fans (an undergraduate paper of his, BMJ editorials and notes from his heartening rise into British policy establishment (he is a public health researcher at the NHS). This was my second pass at his columns; I was again refreshed and uplifted and enraged. We might despair at how persistent insensitivity to evidence has been, and at how unnatural empiricism remains, in a society totally transformed by it. But I don't despair, because it has never been easier for us to check and rebut liars and fools. I sincerely aspire to become a \"<a href=\"http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/01/22/attack-of-the-research-parasites\">research parasite</a>\" (an independent checker of analyses, a rogue forensic statistician) and to write as clearly and well as him.\r\n\r\nGoldacre is that rare thing, someone doing the best work they possibly could be.

    "review": "Or - his preferred book title - <i>The Information Architecture of Medicine has Several Interesting Flaws, Many of Which Inflict Avoidable Harm on Patients, But All of Which are Amenable to Cost-Effective Change, Were There to be Adequate Public and Political Will</i>. An empirically rigorous angry manifesto! \r\n\r\nHere are all of the book's theses in one paragraph, which is another thing I love nonfiction writers doing:\r\n<blockquote><i>Drugs are tested by the people who manufacture them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques that are flawed by design, in such a way that they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don’t like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug’s true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug’s life, and even then they don’t give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion. \r\n\r\nIn their forty years of practice after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works ad hoc, from sales reps, colleagues and journals. But those colleagues can be in the pay of drug companies – often undisclosed – and the journals are, too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, we have no idea what the best treatment is, because it’s not in anyone’s financial interest to conduct any trials at all. These are ongoing problems, and although people have claimed to fix many of them, for the most part they have failed; so all of these programs persist, but worse than ever, because now people can pretend that everything is fine after all.</i>\r\n\r\n[Low external validity] <i>can make a trial completely irrelevant to real-world populations, yet it is absolutely routine in research, which is conducted on tight budgets, to tight schedules, for fast results, by people who don’t mind if their results are irrelevant to real-world clinical questions. This is a quiet, dismal scandal. There’s no dramatic newspaper headline, and no single killer drug: just a slow and unnecessary pollution of almost the entire evidence base in medicine.</i> \r\n</blockquote>\r\nExactly as fair to pharma as it deserves and no more (\"there is no medicine without medicines\"). Business gimps sometimes use the term \"thought leader\", meaning powerful, original thinker (they usually use it spuriously). Goldacre actually is one. Please at least <a href=\"http://www.alltrials.net/\">join AllTrials</a>.\r\n\r\n",

    "review": "Romantic, dramatic, constructive pop science: the physics, meteorology and maths in this was famed but not well-explained before this came out. The theme of the very different results presented here is unprecedented successes in recognising and explaining nonlinear systems. Very human: every researcher is profiled sensitively, generally as an outsider challenging the stuffy, desk-bound precepts of 'linear science'. Since ornery, heroic Mandelbrot is included here, you get an exciting ride even if you don't like maths or science or the world or the underlying generative process of all instances of beauty. \r\n\r\n\"Chaos\" is a bad name for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Theory\">field</a>: it implies randomness, indeterminism, intractability. Better to question why \"order\" can only refer to equilibrium or periodic patterns - why it is we think of order as <i>boring</i>. \"Deterministic disorder\" is more honest - and better yet is Lao-Bin's \"<i>order without periodicity</i>\".\r\n\r\nAlso, the diagrams are poor by contemporary standards: I had to stare at them for a while before grokking the concept.\r\n\r\nBorne on what felt like an epochal wave, Gleick overreaches. He calls Smale and Mandelbrot \"<i>the end of the reductionist program in science</i>\". How is seeking and finding a precise (nonlinear) equation - which is the case in the work of all these men - for a system <i>holist</i>!? \r\n\r\nI don't actually know if the maths in here has changed everything: maybe it has, and they suffer from the Seinfeld effect for dynamical systems, seeming obvious after the fact. But I do know that the Santa Fe strain of work is more of a tolerated eccentric uncle than a science-upending behemoth.",

I am a sucker for this form in pop science: “primary research into some unjustly obscure thing, pulling together the historical and scientific strands, revealing the excitement and transcendence in the unsexy, un-Arts thing, and making the reader feel smarter and more solidly located in the modern world”. Here it's information technology <i>very broadly construed</i> – so African talking drums, Morse, bioinformatics, memetics, Hawking radiation, Wiki, and so on. \r\n\r\nUnbelievably, I’d never heard of the hero of the tale, Claude Shannon, because he was quiet and didn’t make any metaphysical claims for his profound work. Loads and loads of tasty gobbets to boot <blockquote>“<i>I do not believe that my father was such a Poet as I shall be an Analyst (&amp; Metaphysician)…” - Lovelace \r\n\r\n“<i>A theoretical physicist acts as a very clever coding algorithm.</i>” \r\n\r\n“<i>Across the centuries they all felt the joy in reckoning: Napier and Briggs, Kepler and Babbage, making their lists, building their towers…</i>”</blockquote></i> \r\n\r\nShot through with the joy of discovery, and all of it unbleached by the drudgery, familiarity, and commercialism evoked in “I.T.”.\r\n\r\n",

(Funniest clause all month: “<i>thus Lenin was a neo-Thomist – without of course realising it</i>.”) \r\n\r\nThere’s good sad Realism under his playful semiotic historicism: only lazy academic cliques prevent people seeing that the critical realist & the pomo skylark can coexist. So it’s a surprise but not a shock to see him use basically Johnson’s defence against relativism. \r\n\r\nEco chides the Church with its own history! The title essay is composed of quotations from virulent historical racists / misogynists / puritans: it's hard to read. \r\n\r\nHe walks the difficult line between being maximally clear & slightly banal (thus he says things like “Fire is a metaphor for many impulses…”, but also: <blockquote><i>Trying to understand other people means destroying the stereotype without denying or ignoring the otherness.</i></blockquote>).

    "review": "I don't think he's depressing! Does that make me in some way broken? Anyway: Cohen the Jewish Buddhist leverages literary power from a faith he does not own: his poems are thus as erotic and grotesque as the best Christian writing. Much funnier and more concrete than his songs, too. Sure, <i>everything is ominous</i> in his work, but it's also banal, and these often admit they're ridiculous. To my surprise he is never obscure; to my relief he is never fatally wounded by the vicious retribution his many flaws invite. \r\n\r\nGnarled urban spirituality. A strong, unlikely comparison: Bukowski. They both fixate on: plain poems about poems, bitter desire, nakedness, grandiose self-loathing, losers in love, and the significance of everyday things.(Look at this: \"The art of longing's over and it's never coming back.\") Speaking of Bukowski: is Cohen sexist? Arguable. For every slap in the face like '<a href=\"http://scryblen.wordpress.com/2012/01/27/favourite-songs-leonard-cohens-diamonds-in-the-mine/\">Diamonds in the Mine</a>', there are several tendernesses ('<a href=\"http://drhguy.com/2009/07/19/leonard-cohen-portrait-of-a-girl/\">Portrait of a Lady</a>') and self-aware apologies for lust. I would say: shocking and honest about patriarchal shapes, generally not unfeminist. (\"<i>You took my fingerprints away / So I would love you for your mind</i>.\") Moments of chastity inamongst the randy fury - for instance he never says 'God', always 'G-d'.

    "review": "Pompous. Lots of tragic ellipsis. A rare misstep of style, even though the world and its issues are still great, and the progress of a great mind burgeoning amongst strict collectivism is done well. It reads like a debut novel or a draft - good but rough. I suppose I will hail her versatility anyway.\n\nHer characteristic ambiguity and fairness are still here though. The sexist, rankist, capitalist (\"propertarian\") Urrasites are still inventive, tasteful, and ambitious; the anarchist, egalitarian, promiscuous Odonians are still given to egotism, tribalism and petty brutality. They can be relied on, like all of us to tolerate anything except the outgroup:\n<blockquote>\n    'You can only crush [ideas] by ignoring them. By refusing to think — refusing to change. And that's precisely what our society is doing! Sabul uses you where he can, and where he can't, he prevents you from publishing, from teaching, even from working. Right? In other words he has power over you. Where does he get it from?\n\n    Not from vested authority, there isn't any. Not from intellectual excellence, he hasn't any. He gets it from the innate cowardice of the average human mind. Public opinion! That's the power structure he's part of, and knows how to use. The unadmitted, inadmissible government that rules Odonian society by stifling the individual mind.'\n\n    Shevek leaned his hands on the window sill, looking through the dim reflections on the pane into the darkness outside. He said at last 'Crazy talk, Dap.'\n\n    'No, brother, I’m sane. What drives people crazy is trying to live outside reality. Reality is terrible. It can kill you. Given time, it certainly will kill you. But it’s the lies that make you want to kill yourself.'\n\n    Shevek turned around to face him. 'But you can’t seriously talk of a government, here!'\n\n    'Tomar’s Definition: ‘Government: the legal use of power to maintain and extend power.’ Replace ‘legal’ with ‘customary’... Shev, did you ever think that what the analogic mode calls ‘disease,’ social disaffection, discontent, alienation, that this might analogically also be called pain – what you meant when you talked about pain, suffering? And that, like pain, it serves a function in the organism?... I speak of spiritual suffering! Of people seeing their talent, their work, their lives wasted. Of good minds submitting to stupid ones. Of strength and courage strangled by envy, greed for power, fear of change. Change is freedom, change is life – is anything more basic to Odonian thought than that? But nothing changes any more! ... On Urras they have government by the minority. Here we have government by the majority. But it is government!' \n</blockquote>\n\nI don't think her Anarres economy would work even as well as it is depicted as doing, but she has at least thought about it (admits that there would need to be a centralised computer, admits all kinds of shortages). This is not polemic, then; it just doesn't manage her usual grace when dealing with huge dilemmas. A great book by anyone else. ",

    "review": "Sensational. Palmer <i>starts</i> in an Enlightenment utopia (post-war, post-nationalism, post-scarcity, post-gender, post-theocracy, post-fideism, post-meat, post-capital-punishment, post-nuclear-family, general justice via universal voluntary surveillance) and then shows what the tensions will do to any system that has to handle humans as we are.\r\n\r\nMany riches. There are constantly five or so subplots on the go, and when one ends it spawns two others. Best are its careful sketches of deep divides: Tradition vs progress, act vs rule, order vs freedom, safety vs optimum return.\r\n\r\nSome of the oppositions fall flat because I don't have the requisite respect for the other side. For instance <i>Damnatio memoriae</i> - the official expurgation of someone from history - is presented as an ultimate horror (the pain and execution preceding it is overwhelmingly more important). \r\n<blockquote>[the damned person is] <i>neither slim nor mighty, stooped nor noble, just a shape... Somewhere in a dusty archive a baptismal registry records some Hildebrand, and, when that dry page molders... I can't look, I can't! Behind the shades, the broad gray plain, that sea of shapeless gloom extending on and on... all forgotten souls, minds empty of memory, smeared one into another... to this absolute dissolution <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_images_in_the_Soviet_Union\">Caesar</a> damns his enemies... Not me! I will never let you take me! I will carve my memory into history, by work, by force, by guile, in swathes of blood and ashes if I must!\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nI can admire Palmer's rendition of the old bad legacy code (it has driven quite a lot of history) but I admit it no part of a real morality. The dead are past caring.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/aura\">Aura</a> (metaphysical identity) of art is used to devalue perfect replicas of the nuked Coliseum and Forum (which seems like magical thinking to me):\r\n<blockquote><i>All false. Our race cannot afford such losses again... On the Acropolis the tears we shed are still tears of connection: where I stand Socrates stood. In the [replica] Roman Forum, by the [replica] Coliseum or the [replica] Patheon, they are regret tears. Replicas cannot touch. That is what we all want, to touch what someone touched, a special someone... whose story reached forward through history...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nSpeak for yourself; a perfect simulacrum is enough, though it screams depth to say otherwise. (I'm not actually salty: I love the breadth of ideologies on show here. No doubt someone else will grumble about how thin and unconvincing the utilitarian views presented here are. By writing so many good characters in disagreement, Palmer has passed about <a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html\">10 Intellectual Turing Tests</a>. )\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I feel the horror of true deontology quite keenly:\r\n<blockquote><i>Dominic would happily watch the world burn if he could defile the blasphemer's corpse amid the coals.\r\n </blockquote></i>\r\nMuch as I like Jedd Mason, his rise to the top of every state - the expressionless, motionless, Spectrumy king of the world - is implausible, even given his mother's scheming; it only makes sense with Intervention. Which is fine, because Palmer is committed to that, but it would still have been nice to have a natural path.     \r\n\r\nMany potential irritants. You'll have to be fine with long fourth-wall violations, long passages in macaronic Latin, hallucinated philosophers reacting to C25th scenes by expositing their extrapolated view of the 25th Century, allusions that yell 'REMEMBER ME??' in your face (Hobbestown, the anarchist commune). I found Mycroft's madness engaging but it does divert every chapter a bit. \r\n\r\nThe best so far, but you must read the first two. I donno, I'm just rambling now cos I know I'll rewrite this after I read it again in like one unripe year.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<hr />\r\n<b>Misc notes</b>\r\n\r\n* Achilles is an actual hero here - where in the <i>Iliad</i> he is merely impressively violent. Actually as any fool knows, the ancient heroes are mostly morally small, beneath even us. (\"Hero\" meant \"Big Man\", not \"saviour\".) This is good news, that Achilles (and say Jahweh) are not paragons any more.\r\n\r\n* Miracles happen; Bridger is magical through and through, not even needing a virgin birth. So there was no need for JEDD to be born of woman and Spain. Except that this allows him to be a stark example of Hegelian becoming, which here is the way that God speaks. (And what filth he says.)\r\n\r\n* Next time you complain about how undemocratic your country is, consider: The Mitsubishi here are not only a planned plutocracy, they also have 4 orders of delegated authority: the voters elect representatives who elect representatives who elect representatives who elect the executive.\r\n\r\n* Oh Mycroft. I spent the first book and a half wondering exactly why he is so indispensable, hounded, beloved. This mostly answers it: it's a mixture of macaronic language, dog charisma, and weird athleticism.\r\n\r\n* Nice, surprising bit of anarchism: Hobbestown, the anarchist syndicate, is the 'safest' place in the world. OK, its because of the deterrent of capital punishment but still.\r\n\r\n* A decent portrayal of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/\">the burgeoning far-future-focussed ethics</a>, in the otherworldly, post-political, arch-instrumentalist scientists, Utopia. Palmer clearly sympathises with them. One contradiction in her portrayal, though: the Utopians are monomanaical consequentialists, who'll do anything to prevent human extinction or stasis. But they're shown throwing massive resources at trivial uneconomic projects (trivial compared to WMD destruction, space colonization, and terraforming): an underwater city, a city on Antarctica, robots in the shape of mythical beasts. I suppose it's possible this is a PR thing, either to charm or recruit. \r\n\r\nTheir oath actually inspired moral guilt in me, which is hard to do:\r\n<blockquote><i>I hereby renounce the right to complacency, and vow lifelong to take only what minimum of leisure is necessary to my productivity... I will commit the full produce of my labors to our collective effort to redirect the path of human life away from death and toward the stars.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* Palmer knows about a lot of things: Hobbes, evolutionary history, the way a small boat makes waves. Her using this knowledge never felt contrived to me - but again I suspect this is a niche I happen to fall in.\r\n<blockquote><i>The fittest survived, but with the conquered within them, as conquered bacteria became the mitochondria which feed the cells that crawl through volvox, trilobite, and coelacanth toward Mars.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* It suits me that the psychoanalyst Hive choose to be the enemies of the future:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"War?\" Utopia offered.\r\n[the Head Analyst] Felix Faust... accepted the handshake. \"War.\" \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* It's written with a future reader in mind, but then Mycroft explains too much; nothing is taken for granted, and this is obviously on our account, tainting the conceit. \r\n\r\n* Its gender dynamics don't constitute a polemic; instead the Hives' failing utopia shows what most feminist / Critical / international relations theory misses. 'Xenofeminism' (tech-positive, bioprogressive feminism) is a more complete answer to gender harms. But, hearteningly, even mainstream figures <a href=\"http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Ethics_Aesthetics_and_Animals/Nussbaum_Beyond_Compassion_Part_3.htm\">like Nussbaum</a> seem to be on board with similar projects: \r\n<blockquote><i>this calls for the gradual formation of a world in which all species will enjoy cooperative and supportive relations with one another. Nature is not that way and has never been. So it calls for the gradual supplanting of the natural by the just.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* <blockquote><i>A man may leap into the fray in the name of Liberty, Homeland, Human Rights, Justice, but never Economics.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n(more's the pity)\r\n\r\n* <blockquote><i>\r\nIf my Saladin is childhood's fear, the unknowable evil in the closet's depths, I have become adulthood's fear, fear of power, law, illustrious contacts, police resources, covert agencies, and sweet judicial murder.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<spoiler>\r\n* Mycroft's 'death' is immediately subverted by a footnote from him. But then the chapter plays out as if we hadn't seen that footnote, and so it loses most of its emotional charge. This is weird but obviously totally intentional. Twists the twist before the twist can begin. Not sure what's going on - maybe Palmer had tired of doing ordinary twists. (There are a lot of them.)\r\n</spoiler>",

In any case, Harford writes extremely clearly about technical things, and the research can’t be ignored, because it suggests routes for generalised policy (rather than cynical rules to apply to all individual cases).\r\n\r\nExtra point for his lovely immanent-performative ontology of maths: he claims cricket players and economic actors <i>are doing </i>maths unconsciously when they catch a ball or opt for an optimum (third-order differentials). This implies that sunflowers are mathematicians -&nbsp; that all the world is not merely describable with maths, but acts as maths, <i>is</i> maths. I don’t believe this, but isn’t it lovely? \r\n",

Freud done right (\"although the explanations in this book may seem Freudian at times, we follow mainstream cognitive psychology in rejecting most of Freud's methods and many of his conclusions\"). It's introductory, laced with illustrative anecdotes but with much deeper scholarship underneath.\n\nThe 'elephant in the brain' is our unwitting selfishness. We compete without knowing or admitting it, for we are social animals seeking power or status, and thereby sex.\n<blockquote>\n    Modeling the world accurately isn't the be-all and end-all of the human brain. Brains evolved to help our bodies, and ultimately our genes, get along and get ahead in the world—a world that includes not just rocks and squirrels and hurricanes, but also other human beings. And if we spend a significant fraction of our lives interacting with others (which we do), trying to convince them of certain things (which we do), why shouldn't our brains adopt socially useful beliefs as first-class citizens, alongside world-modeling beliefs? Wear a mask long enough and it becomes your face. Play a role long enough and it becomes who you are. Spend enough time pretending something is true and you might as well believe it.\n\n    Incidentally, this is why politicians make a great case study for self-deception. The social pressure on their beliefs is enormous. Psychologically, then, politicians don't so much 'lie' as regurgitate their own self-deceptions. Both are ways of misleading others, but self-deceptions are a lot harder to catch and prosecute. \n</blockquote>\nSimler undertook the book in lieu of a PhD, and his work is a welcome modification of Hanson's usual relentlessly lucid style: he is more concrete, chattier, more personable.\n<blockquote>\n    Information is sensitive in part because it can threaten our self-image and therefore our social image. So the rest of the brain conspires—whispers—to keep such information from becoming too prominent, especially in consciousness. In this sense, the Freuds were right: the conscious ego needs to be protected. But not because we are fragile, but rather to keep damaging information from leaking out of our brain and into the minds of our associates. \n</blockquote>\n\nYou can probably skip this if you're familiar with Overcoming Bias / LessWrong / Econlog - but even then it's a pleasant read.

And then add the coming century's automation and self-modification.\r\n\r\n    <i>Blindsight</i> put me in a funk for a week - even though I don't hold any of the positions it sinks. I suppose this is evidence of Watt's talent. (\"<i>Art is a nonrational tool for persuasion: beware.</i>\") Not the least of its achievements is maintaining its murky nihilism in a world where <i>friendly superintelligences exist</i>.\r\n\r\n    Because of its actual knowledge, this is weird realism, well beyond Lovecraft's. <i>They're coming out of the walls: they're coming out of our best science</i>. The vampires (and, to an extent, the Jovian von Neumann spikefest the plot is about) detract from this deeper horror a bit. Doom; unfixable aberration; people who have warped themselves. If you find <i>Black Mirror</i> a bit too disturbing you might want to give this a miss. Watts even tackles \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliminative_materialism\">illusionism</a>\" - uniquely I think!\r\n\r\n    Is it strange that the giant lessons of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution\">cognitive revolution</a> are still rare in fiction? The only explanations I can think of are: simply \"the Two Cultures\" (i.e. novelists are ignorant); or, more discreditable, that novelists are shilling for traditional philosophy, maybe because it sells. (#1 giant lesson: <i>we do not have introspective access to <b>most</b> of what our brains or minds do</i>, on the level of information processing, action, motivation, or even <a href=\"http://www.cns.nyu.edu/ledoux/pdf/rethinkingEM.pdf\">emotion</a>. You might say Freud found this out - but he didn't use reliable methods, made huge obvious errors, and created a closed unfalsifiable loop and so did not really have knowledge.)\r\n\r\n In contrast, Watts knows a great deal, uses it well, and takes seriously what he knows: for instance, readiness potentials are given all the emotional weight they deserve. This novel has 100 scientific papers listed in the back. The only people who cram quite as many ideas into their books as Watts are Stephenson and Banks.\r\n\r\nHis scorn for the fumbling entendres of psychoanalysis is also extremely endearing:\r\n<blockquote><i>According to the experts of that time, multiple personalities arose spontaneously from unimaginable cauldrons of abuse — fragmentary personae offered up to suffer rapes and beatings while the child behind took to some unknowable sanctuary in the folds of the brain. It was both survival strategy and ritual self-sacrifice: powerless souls hacking themselves to pieces, offering up quivering chunks of self in the desperate hope that the vengeful gods called Mom or Dad might not be insatiable.\r\n\r\nNone of it had been real, as it turned out. Or at least, none of it had been confirmed. The experts of the day had been little more than witch doctors dancing through improvised rituals: meandering free-form interviews full of leading questions and nonverbal cues, scavenger hunts through regurgitated childhoods. Sometimes a shot of lithium or haloperidol when the beads and rattles didn't work. The technology to map minds was barely off the ground; the technology to edit them was years away. So the therapists and psychiatrists poked at their victims and invented names for things they didn't understand, and argued over the shrines of Freud and Klein and the old Astrologers. Doing their very best to sound like practitioners of Science. </i></blockquote>\r\n<br><blockquote><i>\"So we're fishing for what, exactly? Repressed memories?\" \r\n\"No such thing.\" She grinned in toothy reassurance. \"There are only memories we choose to ignore, or kinda think around, if you  know what I mean.\" </i></blockquote>\r\nPeople diss the prose but I think it fits the ethos incredibly well:\r\n<blockquote><i>We fled like frightened children with brave faces. We left a base camp behind: Jack, still miraculously functional in its vestibule; a tunnel into the haunted mansion; forlorn magnetometers left to die in the faint hope they might not. Crude pyronometers and thermographs, antique radiation-proof devices that measured the world through the flex and stretch of metal tabs and etched their findings on rolls of plastic. Glow-globes and diving bells and guide ropes strung one to another... \r\n\r\nInside each of us, infinitesimal lacerations were turning our cells to mush. Plasma membranes sprang countless leaks. Overwhelmed repair enzymes clung desperately to shredded genes and barely delayed the inevitable. Anxious to avoid the rush, patches of my intestinal lining began flaking away before the rest of the body had a chance to die. </i></blockquote>\r\n    Siri, the sociopath pinhead, is a great character. But also often an infuriating <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan\">Hollywood Rationalist</a>, and several times he gets the last word which forces me to suspect Watts of it. Though the bit where his girlfriend is dying and he refuses to say anything because it would be cliched is clearly intentionally infuriating for the reader. So might be this stupid bit of game theory:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Well, according to game theory, you should never tell anyone when your birthday is.\"\r\n\"I don't follow.\" \r\n\"It's a lose-lose proposition. There's no winning strategy.\" \r\n\"What do you mean, strategy? It's a birthday.\" \r\n\r\nLook, I'd said, say you tell everyone when it is and nothing happens. It's kind of a slap in the face.\r\nOr suppose they throw you a party, Chelsea had replied. \r\nThen you don't know whether they're doing it sincerely, or if your earlier interaction just guilted them into observing an occasion they'd rather have ignored. But if you don't tell anyone, and nobody commemorates the event, there's no reason to feel badly because after all, nobody knew. And if someone does buy you a drink then you know it's sincere because nobody would go to all the trouble of finding out when your birthday is — and then celebrating it — if they didn't honestly like you. \r\n\r\n...I could just... plot out the payoff matrix, Tell/Don't Tell along the columns, Celebrated/Not Celebrated along the rows, the unassailable black-and-white logic of cost and benefit in the squares themselves. The math was irrefutable: the one winning strategy was concealment. Only fools revealed their birthdays.</i></blockquote>\r\n- this only follows if you have <i>ridiculously</i> strong error aversion, where the value of being certain about others' opinion of you overrules the pleasantness of ordinary interaction.\r\n\r\n    He mentions (but then averts) the single most annoying error when talking about consciousness, which is that \"maybe it's better for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie\">p-zombie</a> aliens to take over, since they are clearly fitter than us\":\r\n<blockquote><i>\"It doesn't bug you?\" Sascha was saying. \"Thinking that your mind, the very thing that makes you you, is nothing but some kind of parasite?\"\r\n\"Forget about minds,\" he told her. \"Say you've got a device designed to monitor — oh, cosmic rays, say. What happens when you turn its sensor around so it's not pointing at the sky anymore, \r\nbut at its own guts?\" He answered himself before she could: \"It does what it's built to. It measures cosmic rays, even though it's not looking at them any more. It parses its own circuitry in terms of cosmic-ray metaphors, because those feel right, because they feel natural, because it can't look at things any other way. But it's the wrong metaphor. So the system misunderstands everything about itself. Maybe that's not a grand and glorious evolutionary leap after all. Maybe it's just a design flaw.\" </i></blockquote>\r\n(Who cares about fitness? A world without qualia is 'Disneyland without children'.)\r\n\r\nHis Mathesonian attempt to naturalise vampires is <i>kinda</i> clever (they are a subspecies of cannibal savants), and the exemplar vamp Jukka is one of the best characters in the book - but overall their presence is distracting and off-piste; the right-angles epilepsy thing, the revived-by-corporate-greed schtick, more generally holding that corporate culture is putting macroscopic selection pressure to psychopathic nonsentience: all these things jolt me out of his otherwise well-built world.\r\n\r\n    Besides the vampires, there are a few more over-the-top ughs. His whole theme of technology as inherently dehumanising, <i>Black Mirror / Event Horizon</i> is just as cherry-picked and annoying as it always is.     The idea that consciousness is unadaptive, and so a one-off aberration in a universe of blind replicators - which steamrolls all objections in the novel - is not obviously true. But it is certainly true either way that our society is currently unadaptive, in the sense of not maximising reproduction. (And thank god for that.)\r\n\r\nWrenching but admirable.

    "review": "Not the book I thought it was: I wanted searching political / macroeconomic expose of the costs of monopoly, but this is shallow and glib work on a topic of great importance. Galloway's a marketing professor / entrepreneur, and so this is a weird mix of polemical and fawning. (OK, I should've guessed its genre from the thoughtless use of institutional \"DNA\" in the subtitle.) There's basically no politics in this: it's a primer for worried and pious businessmen more than consumers or citizens or engineers. It also uses \"relevant\" unironically as a quantity of ultimate importance (\"<i>Google had a market cap that topped $200 billion. But the Times was enormously relevant</i>\".\n\nI enjoyed this \n<blockquote>\n  [education], the cartel that masquerades as a social good but is really a caste system\n</blockquote>\n\nand this (though his counterproposal wouldn't change much either):\n<blockquote>\nIt is conventional wisdom that Steve Jobs put 'a dent in the universe.' No, he didn’t. Steve Jobs, in my view, spat on the universe. People who get up every morning, get their kids dressed, get them to school, and have an irrational passion for their kids’ well-being, dent the universe. The world needs more homes with engaged parents, not a better fucking phone.\n</blockquote>\n\nHe presents himself as a critical outsider, and a moralist, but in between his rants he is scarcely less fawning about a set of overpriced electronics: \n<blockquote>\nIn those ten years, Apple introduced one earth-shaking, 100-billion-dollar, categorycreating new product or service after another. The iPod, iTunes/Apple Store, iPhone, and iPad ... there has never been anything like it.\n\nThe iPod's introduction, in late 2001 after the twin shocks of the bursting of the dot-com bubble and 9/11, played the same role as the Beatles' appearance on Ed Sullivan just months after the Kennedy assassination: it was a bright light in the darkness that signaled hope and optimism. \n</blockquote>\n\nAnd often his barbs are just glib. His full argument against Bezos' support for basic income:\n<blockquote>\nWhat's clear is that we need business leaders who envision and enact a future with more jobs — not billionaires who want the government to fund, with taxes they avoid, social programs for people to sit on their couches and watch Netflix all day. Jeff, show some real fucking vision.\n</blockquote>\n\n\nBesides the hollowness, there are dozens of minor errors or infelicities:\n<blockquote>\n  Luxury is not an externality; it's in our genes. It combines our instinctive need to transcend the human condition and feel closer to divine perfection, with our desire to be more attractive to potential mates. \n</blockquote>\n(That's not what \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality\">externality</a>\" means.)\n\n<blockquote>\nBecause media companies only get a mildly insane valuation, and the Four are addicted to iconospheric valuations — hundreds of billions. \n</blockquote>\n(\"Ionospheric\" rather)\n<blockquote>\n   When Nietzsche proclaimed God is dead, it wasn't a victory cry but a lamentation on the loss of moral compass.\n</blockquote>\n(1) \"compass\" makes for a really poor adjective, please don't do that; 2) that's a ludicrous reading, though less silly than the usual macho triumph one.)\n<blockquote>\n  The effectiveness of prayer, the additional scrutiny determined, remains a matter of opinion.\n</blockquote>\n(Sure, for a pejorative sense of \"opinion\".)\n\n<blockquote>\n  [big data] signals the end of sampling and statistics - now you can just track the shopping pattern of every customer in every one of your stores\n</blockquote>\n(1) this is the \"n=all\" dogma and, though very popular among people with bridges to sell, it is just not true - because no one ever has the full data set, because even if they did have a synchronous snapshot then we'd still need predictions to future data; 2) even if that were so, it certainly would not be the end of statistics, since sampling theory is a tiny subset of statistics.)\n\n<blockquote>\nThe genius of Google was there from day one, in September 1998, when Stanford students Sergey Brin and Larry Page designed a new web tool, called a search engine, that could skip across the internet in search of keywords.\n</blockquote>\n\nSearch was <i>not</i> a new tool: Knowbot (1989), Archie (1990), Wandex (1993), Mosaic...\n\n<blockquote>\n  We saw the world differently and approached it from entirely different angles. My whole life has been a quest to gain relevance and fear of never achieving it, whereas Arthur's biggest fear (I believe) was losing it.\n</blockquote>\nIn what way are those two angles entirely different?\n\nThis was unintentionally revealing:\n<blockquote>\n  Attractive things work better... When you wash and wax a car, it drives better, doesn't it? Or at least feels like it does.\n</blockquote>\n\nAnd this:\n<blockquote>\n  Malcolm Gladwell, the Jesus of business books...\n</blockquote>\n\nThere's the rub, I think. This is a business book, and since I haven't read any \"business books\" in years I was unprepared for its fawning, glibness, and applause lights. Galloway is no doubt in the right lane; it was I that drifted.\n\nSkip it. The subject - this tiny set of untouchable, market-breaking corporations with large fanbases and financial carte blanche - is important to understand, too important to leave it to Galloway.

    "review": "Overview of both the literary and scifi books, one-by-one. Thus skimmable by anyone who would want to read it in the first place (...)\n\nWorth it, for fans, for the absolutely amazing interview with a PhD student, in which he refuses all invitations to pompous theory:\n<blockquote>\n    JR: You've used the word \"play\" to describe your use of form and narrative structure. As I'm sure you know, in recent years the term play has been used to describe a certain kind of postmodern engagement with the world. To what extent do you consider your work to be postmodern?\n\n    IB: I confess I don't think about it at all. I've never been good on literary or societal theory. I've long since decided people like me just write what we do and let other people worry about the analytical side.\n\n    JR: Have you read any work by Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, or Emanuel Levinas (or any other continental philosophers)? If you have, what did you think?\n\n    IB: The little I've read I mostly didn't understand, and the little I understood of the little I've read seemed to consist either of rather banal points made difficult to understand by deliberately opaque and obstructive language (this might have been the translation, though I doubt it), or just plain nonsense. Or it could be I'm just not up to the mark intellectually, of course.\n\n    JR: You have written quite a few novels that use Freudian imagery and tropes—The Wasp Factory, Use of Weapons, The Bridge, Walking on Glass—What do you think of Freudian psychoanalysis?\n\n    IB: Never been entirely sold on it. I suspect Freud's theories tell you a great deal about Freud, quite a lot about the monied middle-class in Vienna a hundred-plus years ago, and only a little about people in general. Like Marx, he was too keen to insist that his area of study was genuinely a science. Also like Marx, though, he provides a genuinely useful and insightful (if, especially in Freud's case, limited) way of looking at people and their hidden lives (well, more implied lives with Marx, relating to their economic function within a society). Anyway, I can honestly say that I've never deliberately included any Freudian imagery in my stories, so what's there must be the result of my subconscious. . . . Uh-oh. . . \n</blockquote>",

    "review": "Relentlessly idiomatic. Hollow like a bell. Marlowe is not presented as feeling anything except incessant fatigue and occasional lust. The prose is fast and somehow innocent though surrounded by darkness:\n<blockquote><i>\n    The eighty-five cent dinner tasted like a discarded mail bag and was served to me by a waiter who looked as if he would slug me for a quarter, cut my throat for six bits, and bury me at sea in a barrel of concrete for a dollar and a half, plus sales tax. \n\n    A hand I could have sat in came out of the dimness and took hold of my shoulder and squashed it to a pulp. Then the hand moved me through the doors and casually lifted me up a step. The large face looked at me. A deep soft voice said to me, quietly:\n    \"Smokes in here, huh? Tie that for me, pal.\"\n    It was dark in there. It was quiet. From up above came vague sounds of humanity, but we were alone on the stairs. The big man stared at me solemnly and went on wrecking my shoulder with his hand.\n    \"A dinge,\" he said. \"I just thrown him out. You seen me throw him out?\" \n</i></blockquote>\nSure, Noir is cliche now, but we should try to stop Seinfeld effects from undermining original work. And I think he really was original.\n<blockquote><i>    You could get to like that face a lot. Glamoured up blondes were a dime a dozen, but that was a face that would wear. I smiled at it. \n</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>\n    Give him enough time and pay him enough money and he'll cure anything from a jaded husband to a grasshopper plague. He would be an expert in frustrated love affairs, women who slept alone and didn't like it, wandering boys and girls who didn't write home, sell the property now or hold it for another year, will this part hurt me with my public or make me seem more versatile? Men would sneak in on him too, big strong guys that roared like lions around their offices and were all cold mush under their vests. But mostly it would be women, fat women that panted and thin women that burned, old women that dreamed and young women that thought they might have Electra complexes, women of all sizes, shapes and ages, but with one thing in common—money. No Thursdays at the County Hospital for Mr. Jules Amthor. \n</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>    \"You lied to me.\"\n    \"It was a pleasure.\"\n    He was silent a moment, as if deciding something. \"We'll let that pass,\" he said. \"I've seen her.

    "review": "A pinnacle of style. He lays it out and winds it up within about 90 pages, then drawls out a subplot over the last 40. One reason it's still so fresh is the understatement. The \"fuck\"s are all em-dashed out, and basically everybody is constantly dry and laconic with each other, Marlowe most of all of course. In fact it's notable when one character is inarticulate (\"<i>Carol Lundgren, the boy killer with the limited vocabulary...</i>\") \r\n<blockquote><i>\"Sit down next to him,\" Brady snapped. \"Hold it on him low down, away from the door...\"\r\nShe came over and sat next to me on the davenport and pointed the gun at my leg artery. I didn't like the jerky look in her eyes.</blockquote></i>\r\n(\"Leg artery\")\r\n\r\nIt wears <i>noir</i>'s obligatory cynicism lightly: <blockquote><i>\"I'm a copper,\" he said, \"a plain ordinary copper. Reasonably honest. As honest as you could expect a man to be in a world where it's out of style.\"</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>Being a copper I like to see the law win. I'd like to see the flashy well-dressed mugs like Eddie Mars spoiling their manicures in the rock quarry at Folsom, alongside of the poor little slum-bred guys that got knocked over on their first caper and never had a break since. [But] We just don't run our country that way.</blockquote></i>\r\nConstantly balances concision and winning detail, e.g: <blockquote><i>\"Ohls growled and turned to me, his eyebrows bristling. «You're on the air, Marlowe. Give it to him.\"\r\nI gave it to him.\r\nI left out two things, not knowing just why, at the moment, I left out one of them. I left out Carmen's visit to Brody's apartment and Eddie Mars' visit to Geiger's in the afternoon. I told the rest of it just as it happened.\r\nCronjager never took his eyes off my face and no expression of any kind crossed his as I talked. At the end of it he was perfectly silent for a long minute. Wilde was silent, sipping his coffee, puffing gently at his dappled cigar.

    "review": "A look at high-energy particle physics* in its present <a href=\"https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-lhc-nightmare-scenario-has-come-true.html\">nightmare</a> (of deep inconsistency and vastly expensive new data). Her thesis is that the problem is sociological and aesthetic: in the absence of new data sources, we form cliques and regroup around incompatible, unempirical beauty intuitions. \r\n<blockquote><i>it leads me to conjecture that the laws of nature are beautiful because physicists constantly tell each other those laws are beautiful.</blockquote></i><blockquote><i>experimentalists working with a detector developed to catch neutrinos reported on the first “interesting bounds on galactic cold dark matter and on light bosons emitted from the sun.” In plain English, “interesting bounds” means they didn’t find anything. Various other neutrino experiments at the time also obtained interesting bounds.</blockquote></i>\r\nHer prescription is that we should stop limiting the field so heavily with naturalness or geometric naturalness or symmetry or unification or  anti-fine-tuning intuitions, which collectively she (following her field) calls \"beauty\". Since Physical beauty is quite distinct from natural-language \"beauty\", I think it'd be better if we left those five components under a different name.\r\n\r\nFilled with interviews with some of the cleverest, deepest physicists of our time (Arkani-Harked, Wilczek, Weinberg, Lisi, Polchinski) and the several bandwagons they lead, blind, in different directions. Hossenfelder herself is funny, self-critical, scrupulously clear: the kind of curmudgeonly, unbiddable empiricist we always need.\r\n<blockquote><i>“You ask, why do people still work on it?” Nima [Arkani-Harked] continues. “It’s in fact very funny. As I said, the best people had a pretty good idea what was going on—they were not sitting on their hands waiting for gluinos to pour out of the LHC. They also had a pretty level reaction to the data.”\r\n\r\nBut not one of those “best people” spoke up and called bullshit on the widely circulated story that the LHC had a good chance of seeing supersymmetry or dark matter particles. I’m not sure which I find worse, scientists who believe in arguments from beauty or scientists who deliberately mislead the public about prospects of costly experiments.\r\n\r\nNima continues: “The people who were sure it would be there are now positive it’s not there. There are people now who speak about being depressed or worried or scared. It drives me nuts. It’s ludicrously narcissistic. Who the fuck cares about you and your little life? Other than you yourself, of course.”\r\n\r\nHe isn’t speaking about me, but he might as well be, I think. Maybe I’m just here to find an excuse for leaving academia because I’m disillusioned, unable to stay motivated through all the null results. And what an amazing excuse I have come up with—blaming a scientific community for misusing the scientific method.\r\n\r\nOn the plane back to Frankfurt, bereft of Nima’s enthusiasm, I understand why he has become so influential. In contrast to me, he believes in what he does.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nThat sweet bitterness is telling; Hossenfelder is the broke-down hard-boiled P.I. of particle physics.\r\n<i><blockquote>\r\nI shouldn’t be here, I should be at my desk, reading a paper, drafting a proposal, or at least writing a referee report. I shouldn’t psychoanalyze a community that neither needs nor wants therapy.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<i><blockquote>I hook onto the Wi-Fi. After a week of nonstop travel, my inbox is filling with urgent messages. There are two unhappy editors complaining about overdue reports, a journalist asking for comment, a student asking for advice. A form to be signed, a meeting to be rescheduled, two phone calls to be made, a conference invitation that needs to be politely declined. A collaborator returns the draft of a grant proposal for revision.\r\n\r\nI remember reading biographies of last century’s heroes, picturing theoretical physicists as people puffing pipes in leather armchairs while thinking big thoughts.</i></blockquote>\r\nHer exposition is impressively clear, covering the whole standard model (and quantum mechanics, and much of modern cosmology) in plain diagrams and terse language. (Though, as usual with pop science, one can't really spot where the simplifications are misleading unless you're already an insider.)\r\n\r\nThe heavies are in general very open and undogmatic about the state of things (they can afford to be, what with tenure). Weinberg:\r\n<blockquote><i>    I don’t know how much elementary particle physics can improve over what we have now. I just don’t know. I think it’s important to try and continue to do experiments, to continue to build large facilities… But where it will end up I don’t know. I hope it doesn’t just stop where it is now. Because I don’t find this entirely satisfying…\r\n\r\n    I don’t take seriously any negative conclusion that the fact that the LHC hasn’t seen anything beyond the standard model shows that there isn’t anything that will solve the naturalness problem… Supersymmetry hasn’t been ruled out because it’s too vague about what it predicts.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n(There's a nice bit where Weinberg hears a new philosophical/historical theory of physics - that the revolutions always involve overthrowing an old aesthetic principle - and is immediately nerd-sniped and charmed by it. Also Wilczek:\r\n<i><blockquote>According to McAllister, scientists don’t throw out everything during a revolution; they only throw out their conception of beauty. So whenever there is a revolution in science, they have to come up with a new idea of beauty. He lists some examples for this: the steady state universe, quantum mechanics, et cetera.\r\n“If that was true,” I go on, “it would tell me that getting stuck on the ideas of beauty from the past is exactly the wrong thing to do.”\r\n“Yes, right,” Frank says. “It’s normally a good guiding principle. But occasionally you have to introduce something new. In each of these examples you find, though, that the new ideas are beautiful too.”\r\n“But people only found that new beauty after data forced them to look at it,” I point out. “And I’m worried we might not be able to get there. Because we are stuck on this old idea of beauty that we use to construct theories and to propose experiments to test them.”\r\n“You might be right.\"</i></blockquote>)\r\n\r\nShe even seeks out the ugliest theories, like Xiao-Gang Wen's string-net condensation, trying to find her own aesthetic limits:\r\n<blockquote><i>I am skeptical, but I tell myself to be more open-minded. Isn’t this what I was looking for, something off the well-trodden path? Is it really any weirder to believe everything is made of qubits than of strings or loops or some 248-dimensional representation of a giant Lie algebra?\r\n\r\nHow patently absurd it must appear to someone who last had contact with physics in eleventh grade that people get paid for ideas like that. But then, I think, people also get paid for throwing balls through hoops.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThis bit understates a real problem (it implies we don't use Solomonoff induction out of pique rather than incomputability):\r\n<blockquote><i>A way to objectively quantify simplicity is by computational complexity, which is measured by the length of a computer program that executes a calculation. Computational complexity is in principle quantifiable for any theory that can be converted into computer code, which includes the type of theories we currently use in physics. We are not computers, however, and computational complexity is therefore not a measure we actually use. The human idea of simplicity is instead very much based on ease of applicability, which is closely tied to our ability to grasp an idea, hold it in mind, and push it around until a paper falls out.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nBetter than <i>The Trouble with Physics</i> which I also liked (though he was narrower and less balanced about string theory). Maybe 5/5 if I reread it. <a href=\"https://backreaction.blogspot.com/\">Her blog is extremely worthwhile</a> and more technical and thus less untrue.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n* OK, \"high-energy particle physicists and also Grand Unified Theorists of whatever stripe including some cosmologists\". But it is wrong to say that \"physics\" <i>tout court</i> has a crisis, nor indeed does Hossenfelder say this. (She didn't choose her own subtitle.)",

All the way from Galen to personal oncogenetics.\r\n\r\nThe section on pre-anesthesia radical surgery was truly nauseating. A horrendous macho fad:\r\n<blockquote><i>Haagensen wrote in 1956: 'it is my duty to carry out as radical an operation as the... anatomy permits.'\r\n\r\nThe radical mastectomy had... edged into the “ultraradical,” an extraordinarily morbid, disfiguring procedure in which surgeons removed the breast, the pectoral muscles, the axillary nodes, the chest wall, and occasionally the ribs, parts of the sternum, the clavicle, and the lymph nodes inside the chest.\r\n\r\nBreast cancer, [Halsted] claimed, spun out from the breast into the lymph nodes under the arm, then cartwheeled mirthlessly through the blood into the liver, lungs, and bones. A surgeon’s job was to arrest that centrifugal spread by cutting every piece of it out of the body, as if to catch and break the wheel in midspin. This meant treating early breast cancer aggressively and definitively. The more a surgeon cut, the more he cured.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe sheer amount of money and genius thrown at cancer - <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/01/cancer-progress-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/\">with merely gradual returns</a> - is not really considered in terms of its opportunity cost, by Mukherjee of anyone - what diseases might we have cured with those hundreds of billions? What giant, clever prevention studies run?

For any illness to rise to political prominence, it needed to be marketed, just as a political campaign needed marketing. A disease needed to be transformed politically before it could be transformed scientifically.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nand later with the powerful patient blocs.\r\n\r\nNot sure who would benefit from reading this closely; there's too much detail.

    "review": "<blockquote><i>Abuser, Sexual\r\nAccess to the Unknown\r\nAnal Penetration\r\nAyleswade Road...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe best documentarian and architecture critic in Britain - also \"the best amateur chef in the world\" (cf. Marco Pierre-White) - writes about his childhood in a brutal panoptic manner. His unsentimentality about himself, his mother, his horrible uncles, is startling, even speaking as a fan of <a href=\"http://meadesshrine.blogspot.com/p/shrine.html\">his sarky and acid programmes</a>. It's not exactly linear: there are several odd repetitions and filling-ins, mimicking the meandering of memory. Still, Meades' prose makes them worthwhile twice over:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nWhen, after they had both died, I sold my parents' house, I got rid of a cupboardful of toys which had collected decades' dust, and a bookcase of Eagle annuals, Tiger annuals, Buffalo Bill annuals and so on. I picked through tins of broken pens and perished erasers. I excitedly anticipated the past to come rushing back. Each of these rusty, tarnished pieces of metal or plastic is, surely, a potential madeleine, a mnemonic of some bright day in 1959. They were, however, doggedly mute.\r\n\r\nIt took time in that house whose purpose was finished to realise that this was a pitiful and self-pitying exercise: I was trying to freeze myself, to transport myself back to the land of lost content which had, actually, been no such thing. I was trying to do to myself what parents do to their children.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nNo girls meant no calm solicitude, no sweet fragrance of talc and cleanliness, but, rahter, the soilpipe smell of almost a hundred shrieking, blubbing, chucking, grubby, boisterous, energetic, savage, merciless small boys... Kissing was of course sissy. In the Cathedral School's swimming-pool changing hut, a riot of asbestos, just-prepubescent boys boxed with their penises in friendly companionabiity and competitive violence: he who drew blood won. They aptly dignified this as 'cockfighting', insouciantly associating covert pugilism with the hedgerow gamblers' sport conducted between roofless brick cowsheds where flames from pyres of palettes relieve the ruined farmyard's midden chill and lend ceremony to the bucolic rite.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>Some fleshpot, Southampton: the Port Said of the Solent. A poor whore has only to sit in a window in Derby Road, and a major police operation will be launched. All the coppers who've been on Cottage Patrol squeeze out from beneath the rafter to race a mile east from the Common. Their route takes them past Great Aunt Doll's chaotic bungalow where there were peals of dirty laughter and sweet sherry and sweet Marsala, and a room heated to eighty degrees and fish and chips for a dozen in an enamel bowl, and gossip and ribbing and silly stories, and gaspers, and will someone let the dog out else he's going to wee on the couch, and Jonathan you better go with him if you want a widdle cos Eric's been and done a big one...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nI had emerged [from Sunday School] a materialist. It was, equally, the first time I had walked out of anything, that I had had the nerve to walk out. Thus was a lifelong habit initiated. Cinemas, jobs, sexual relationships, exams, opportunities, marriages, commitments, professional partnerships, schools, theatrical performances (a specialty), parties, expeditions, dinners, homes, prior arrangements - I've walked out of them all, often.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe whole book is anomalous - it is sustained emotional recollection by a professed enemy of nostalgia:\r\n<blockquote><i>Nostalgia is not simply a yearning for a lost home, a yearning which can never be satisfied by revisiting that home, which could only be satisfied by becoming once more the child who inhabited that home, at that time. It is also primitive, pre-rational, pre-learning. It quashes developed taste, aesthetic preference, learnt refinements. It insists that the chance associations of infancy are more obstinately enduring than the chosen positions of our subsequent sentience. It tells us that we are lifers in a mnemonic prison from which there is no reprieve.</blockquote></i>\r\nBut then the man's an anomaly: a razorish rationalist, a scathing positivist about the arts, who has devoted his life to them. (<i>They were accompanied by their arty and - it follows - entirely artless friends.</i>)\r\n\r\n    His childhood was not like other children's in Fifties Britain. (I'm comparing his to Bennett, Hitchens, wrongly also Clive James.) His parents quietly rewarded his not conforming, and he ate Afghan curry throughout (his father was stationed in Iraq and brought back a tonne of spices). He grew up surrounded by clergy and the weapons scientists of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porton_Down\">Downs</a>:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nI pictured the Red Menace - a cannibalistic giant whose face was impasted with human gristle and blood; bullnecked mass murderers weighed down by medals; cloud seeding; barbed wire; secret policemen; evil scientists; informers; torturers; factories as big as cities; insanitary collective farms; starvation; deportations. 'You're going to Siberia!' was a playground taunt of the Fifties.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n(He really likes the biological warfare men, in maybe the biggest piece of contrarianism in this large contrary book.)\r\n\r\nThe book stops when he's only 17 - but there are so, so many deaths in it. Maybe 70, counting the drowned calf; my total by that age was 3. Let's say he delights in the <i>contrast</i> with today, not in the deaths themselves.\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nFor all they spoke of death, I might have believed we live perpetually, growing ever more crooked, more and more dried up, more rasping, more fearful. (I obviously didn't know that it was death's proximity that caused the eyes of the very old to communicate unimaginable terror.) ...The names of the dead were dropped from conversation, as one might drop that of a disloyal friend. Death seemed to be a kind of disgrace... The rare times they were remembered, it was with irked brusqueness.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n    It is <i>very</i> easy to put him in a bad light; he makes it easy for you, because he is always absolutely emphatic, usually vitriolic, and often wrong. (The things he's wrong about include vegetarians, anti-racism overall*, arguably human rights.**) \r\n<blockquote><i>Where would we be without monotheism, fasts, judicial impartiality, the eucharist, sincerity, pork's proscription, Allah's ninety-nine names and seventy-two virgins, weather forecasts, life plans, political visions, conjugated magpies, circumcision, sacred cows, the power of prayer, insurance policies, gurus' prescriptions, the common good, astrology? Where indeed? But those are the big lies. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>Picturing the equine Princess Royal is a sure way of inhibiting orgasm and prolonging enjoyment, so long as one doesn't picture her for too long and so risk flaccidity.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>stoical meiosis was normal in a generation which denied itself deep immersion in feeling, had not learned to wallow in empathy, understood an outpouring to be the discharge of cloacal sewage. The lexicon of demonstrative care had yet to be coined; the people's absurd princess had yet to be born; the mistakenly unaborted Blair had yet to perfect the catch of tremulous sincerity in his voice.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>my mother had assured me that the old testament was risible tosh. And so it is. So, of course, are all 'holy' books. But risible tosh can be persuasive.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>The desert landscape [in Iraq] is relentlessly grim. There was indigenous hostility to contend with. The Arab world was broadly sympathetic to the Axis powers. (The Nazis' successors are not the lost causists of the BNP, NPD and Vlaams Belang but the totalitarian Islamist post-Khomeini terror states... The Arab armies included Bosnian Muslim veterans of the Handzar SS brigades... The entire sentimental Arabist package, the tradition of the fawning British buggerocracy - Richard Burton, T.E. Lawrence, St John Philby, Glubb Pasha, Wilfred Thesiger and countless other aristocratic eccentrics - had become <i>la pensee unique</i> of the army's higher strata. It was also (not that its adherents acknowledged it) effete, misogynistic, irrational, anti-urban, Luddite and gullible.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>Antiquarian pillage is hardly scholarly and far from scientific, but its perpetrators were not culpable of the misanthropic relativism which grants rights to ancient amphorae and entitlements to yokes' remnants. Nor did they conceive of history in terms of movements, big ideas and sweeping theses. Their empiricism militated against generalisation.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>The tyranny of minorities had caused the atomisation of England. The damage is repairable - by state terror or mob rule. But since the state's treasonable clerks are the very cause of the embuggerance we can be sure that it will do nothing. And a mob needs a leader to bring its hatred to the boil, foment its venom, drive it on. It needs the Duke of Edinburgh. Much as he might wish it he won't be around.</blockquote></i>\r\nConsider that last one: it is natural to read in it a fascist glee - but it isn't that at all. It is rather the dread of inevitable deadlock and looming contradictions. There's no relish, only misplaced fear. But you need to have read his contempt of fascists (and of Philip) and his fear of totalitarianism <i>before</i>, for it to sound like that.\r\n\r\nWhy isn't the cannibal internet calling him out? Because he is in the grey zone of non-celebrity? Because he is too old to shame? Because he isn't on Twitter? Anyway: He is neither a bigot (offensive because hateful and ignorant), nor a clickbait troll (intentionally, insincerely offensive), nor an aged victim of social drift (obliviously offensive): he has not defaulted to these opinions; he was never much tied to his time's prevailing prejudices, whether it's Fifties' conformism and class obsession or Noughties PC and pomo. His antipathies are reasoned and he refuses to pander. Compare this passage to e.g. what Yiannopoulos was finally banished for:\r\n<blockquote><i>The formula states that adults are wicked predators, children are innocent prey. In the hierarchy of abuse, paedophilia (which may be literally that, liking children) is demonised, fetishised. It has giddily attained equal status with race crime... Homo faber. Isn't he just? Man has devised multitudinous forms of child abuse which are not sexual. Their immeasurable consequences may, however, be just as grave as those of sexual abuse. \r\n\r\nChild soldier, child slave, child labourer, child miner, child skiv, child beggar, child bloody from scrounging in the shambles.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThe book is highly abridged (only up to cram school) and still a bit too long. Before reading this you should first watch <a href=\"http://meadesshrine.blogspot.com/p/shrine.html\">any 10 of these films</a>.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n* If you insist on challenging the worst e.g. woke, <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/kim-kardashian-braids-explanation\">trivial</a> internet activism, you have to say that's what you're against: Meades is being uncharacteristically imprecise, and decimating sympathy as a result. \"Against (actually-existing) anti-racism\" is not the same as \"pro-racism\", but people will read you that way unless you give them explicit reason not to. (And even then.)\r\n\r\n** Rights are only good if they produce good outcomes; lots of people all over the world think in terms of imperatives and absolutes and it is almost futile to argue about it; thus rights can be a useful fiction. Meades again spits on \"rights\" in general without laying out this or any other philosophical objection, without showing us what he's for and so allowing people to not think the worst.",

    "review": "Unsentimental, by which I mean unpleasant.\r\n\r\nOn fertility and death, delusion and meaning, undertakers and civil engineers. Many beautiful passages, much reflection on the course of recent British history - but never didactic -\r\n<blockquote><i>Ben and Ben's fellow squash prodigy, keen, bulgy-muscled Nolan Oates lolled side by side on a striped recliner and a Portofino chair chosen by Naomi and bought by Henry out of the fruits of his labours burying and burning the dead for the children of the dead.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>They cycled through the night, not knowing where they were going, ignoring maps, signposts, stars, anxious only to be far from that flat scrubland. Fear fuelled their tendons, pushed the pedals hard. They were oblivious to the sycamore’s grazes and to the stiff hills. Their tyres purred. They passed hamlets, silos, byres, kennels, the illumined windows of hostile hearths. The swarthy bulk of a moor’s escarpment slumped against the sky, a beast best left to lie. The world was every shade of black: slave, sump, crow, char. Clumsy clouds lumbered into each other, blind, bloated, slomo, piling up in a piggyback of obese buggers over the terrible trees. The night was loud with the shrieks and moans of creatures berating their fate and their want of shelter. When the rain came it was from a sluice that stretched from one horizon to the next. The road became a tide against them.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nand anyway it's extremely well-grounded in Meades' obsessive attention to detail (not just artistic detail, any detail)\r\n<blockquote><i>The miracle of life. That baby could now bring a carbon-fibre racket into contact with a rubber ball travelling at 90 m.p.h. in such a way that the ball’s speed would be so reduced that when it touched the front wall of the court it would plummet vertically to the floor. That was a miracle. And so was the human ingenuity which made the connection between that ball’s terminal trajectory and a dead bird and advertised that ingenuity by the use of the figurative construction ‘to kill a ball’. Telephones, butterfly stroke, nylon-tip pens, the emotive capability of music, the way some people are blond and some are left-handed, the shapes of faces in clouds, water’s inability to flow uphill, the tastiness of animals’ flesh, pain, bustles, reptiles’ poison sacs, sinus drainage, cantilevering, DNA testing – miracles of life, all of them.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nMeades is an aesthete - but still rightly unforgiving of art in the wrong place, here an experimental postmodernist roundabout that kills five.\r\n\r\nIt get better when it stops sneering. The middle section portrays two professions, two quiet lives: funeral director and civil engineer, warm family man and late bloomer:\r\n<blockquote><i>Exclusion, Henry recognised, was what defined every profession. He practised it himself. It was what differentiated him from civilians. Without exclusion and the stamp of expertise it brought … well, the unthinkable might occur: the bereaved might realise that they could do it themselves, take the law into their own hands. They’d conduct backyard cremations. They’d dig graves in their gardens as though burying the family pet.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe middle seems natalist; the nuclear family seem much happier. Just wait. The death of your parents as only their being \"<i>denied a future of rages, chair-lifts, incontinence, slobbering aphasia, fright, wind, butter on the rug, soup on the cardie...  How long he would have had to prepare himself for the embalming job of a lifetime, how long he would have had to watch as all dignity left her and she became a machine for processing soup into diarrhoea. It might be painful watching them turn into veg, decline into insentient senescence before our eyes but at least it’s a process that acquaints us with loss gradually.</i>\".\r\n\r\n(Meades contrives a neat point about human nature: when the Crystal Palace burns down, the fire engines couldn't reach it to save it because the roads are congested with spectators. This isn't accurate but whatev.)\r\n\r\nOscillates between sympathy and unforgiving light; suddenly swerves away from two offered happy endings. Not sure what to make of the grim climax - the cuckold going off the deep end, becoming unmoored from his home, his work, his decency. Meades is no patriarch, so the implication shouldn't be 'so would you'. I think it's about the madness of biology, its inhumane imperatives and tragic spread.\r\n\r\nGood but not a patch <a href=\"https://meadesshrine.blogspot.com/p/shrine.html\">on his films</a>.",

    "review": "<blockquote><i>1. In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?\r\n2. Where does the majority of the world population live?\r\n3. In the last 20 years, the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has…\r\n4. What is the life expectancy of the world today?\r\n5. There are 2 billion children in the world today, aged 0 to 15 years old. How many children will there be in the year 2100, according to the United Nations?\r\n6. The UN predicts that by 2100 the world population will have increased by another 4 billion people. What is the main reason?\r\n7. How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the last hundred years?\r\n...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/gms/\">Only 10% of people scored better than random guessing</a> on these questions, the most important trends of the last hundred years. How can it be that we are both 1) a rabidly overconfident species <i>and</i> 2) an extremely pessimistic species that generally gets these simple, objective questions very wrong (doing far worse than random)? Sure, we could just be dogmatic nihilists or idiots, but that doesn't fit that well. \r\n<blockquote><i>A stunning 15% of humans managed to pick the wrong answer on all twelve questions. That’s almost impossible for a monkey to achieve. It requires systematic misconceptions. The problem here is not the lack of correct knowledge. The problem is the presence of wrong “knowledge”. To score this bad requires a false perception of the world, that make you pick the wrong answer systematically.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nRosling explains it in terms of cognitive biases: we suffer from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic\"><i>dramatic</i></a> worldview, binarised, conflict-obsessed, and blamey. \r\n\r\nPeople seem to find Development - the completely unprecedented explosion of survival, freedom, and dignity for the larger part of the entire world! - boring. (You could blame the media, but Rosling persuasively argues that they too are an epiphenomenon of our evolved fear and narrowness.)\r\n<blockquote><i>Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from <a href=\"https://www.gapminder.org/topics/four-income-levels/\">Level 4</a> [the top 10% of global income]; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. \r\n\r\nWhen you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 3, 2, and 1 can look equally poor, and the word poor can lose any specific meaning... Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small... It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nOn the shocking lack of empiricism even in the most important places like medicine and policy:\r\n<blockquote><i>In the 1960s, the success of the recovery position inspired new public health advice, against most traditional practices, to put babies to sleep on their tummies... Even though the data showed that sudden infant deaths went up, not down, it wasn’t until 1985 that a group of pediatricians in Hong Kong actually suggested that the prone position might be the cause. Even then, doctors in Europe didn’t pay much attention. It took Swedish authorities another seven years to accept their mistake and reverse the policy...\r\n\r\nWith my own hands, over a decade or so, I turned many babies from back to tummy to prevent \r\nsuffocation and save lives. So did many other doctors and parents throughout Europe and the United \r\nStates, until the advice was finally reversed, 18 months after the Hong Kong study was published. \r\nThousands of babies died because of a sweeping generalization, including some during the months \r\nwhen the evidence was already available. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>Two hundred ninety-two brave young feminists had traveled to Stockholm from across the world to coordinate their struggle to improve women's access to education. But only 8 percent knew that 30-year-old women have spent on average only one year less in school than 30-year-old men.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nBad incentives and noble lies are another reason for the stubborn gloom of intellectuals:\r\n<blockquote><i>There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women's education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nRelentlessly sensible:\r\n<blockquote><i>resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nI've been studying Development for years and this still taught me plenty. It should shock you into awareness and hopefully more.\r\n<blockquote><i>Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem, and therefore save many fewer lives. This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources. It is hard for people to talk about resources when it comes to saving lives, or prolonging or improving them Doing so is often taken for heartlessness. Yet so long as resources are not infinite—and they never are infinite—it is the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nOne of the \"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/68316850?shelf=worldview-in-five-books\">five books that represent my worldview</a>\": moral passion, strict empiricism, psychological depth, existential hope. I picked this rather than <i>Enlightenment Now</i> or <i>Rational Optimist</i> or <i>Doing Good Better</i> or <i>Our World In Data</i> or <i>Whole Earth Discipline</i> (out of the contemporary literature of progress) because it also covers heuristics and biases - and so substitutes / complements Kahneman, Taleb, Hanson, and Yudkowsky, without (what people insist on seeing as) their self-superior wonkishness.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Thank you industrialization, thank you steel mill, thank you power station, thank you chemical-processing industry, for giving us the time to read books. </blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nIn a sense he stays on the surface - this isn't the full radical evolutionary account of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820444-the-elephant-in-the-brain\"><i>Elephant in the Brain</i></a>, instead just noting some bad epistemic practices and gesturing at evolutionary theory. But that said, there's a \"charity is not about helping\" bit:\r\n<blockquote><i>If I check the World Wildlife Fund I can see how, despite declines in some local populations, the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. It was worth paying for all those pandas stickers on the doors all around Stockholm. Yet only 6% of the Swedish public knows that their support has had any effect.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nBut despite all the suffering and error and backfiring efforts he describes, he is trying to make you realise how good things could be:\r\n<blockquote><i>Could everyone have a fact-based worldview one day? Big change is always difficult to imagine. But it is definitely possible, and I think it will happen, for two simple reasons. First: a fact-based worldview is more useful for navigating life, just like an accurate GPS is more useful for finding your way in the city. Second, and probably more important: a fact-based worldview is more comfortable. It creates less stress and hopelessness than the dramatic worldview, simply because the dramatic one is so negative and terrifying. \r\n\r\nWhen we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems— and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better. </blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the same message as <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World?ac=1&from_search=true\">Sagan</a>, 25 years ago: the emotional gain of reason. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<b>Misc notes</b>\r\n\r\n- Binary categories are often unhelpful because they obscure continuum. Rosling ranted against \"developed\" / \"developing\" for 20 years. The World Bank has caught on but the UN haven't.\r\n\r\n- He is a better messenger for the cognitive bias alarm, for activists anyway, because of his deep credibility: he mucked in to anti-poverty measures for decades. Some of his anecdotes are chilling.\r\n<blockquote><i>I could tell you countless stories of the nonsense I saw in Cuba: the local moonshine, a toxic fluorescent concoction brewed inside TV tubes using water, sugar, and babies’ poopy diapers to provide the yeast required for fermentation; the hotels that hadn’t planned for any guests and so had no food, a problem we solved by driving to an old people’s home and eating their leftovers from the standard adult food rations; my Cuban colleague who knew his children would be expelled from \r\nuniversity if he sent a Christmas card to his cousin in Miami; the fact that I had to explain my research methods to Fidel Castro personally to get approval. I will restrain myself and just tell you why I was there and what I discovered. </blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n- \"<i>I do not believe that fake news is the major culprit for our distorted worldview: we haven’t only just started to get the world wrong, I think we have always gotten it wrong.</i>\"\r\n\r\n- \"<i>In the car industry, cars are recalled when a mistake is discovered. You get a letter from the manufacturer saying, “We would like to recall your vehicle and replace the brakes.” When the facts about the world that you were taught in schools and universities become out of date, you should get a letter too: “Sorry, what we taught you is no longer true. Please return your brain for a free upgrade.” </i>\"",

    "review": "How did a \"haggard and ghastly\" foreigner from a poor-noble family end up ruling two-thirds of Europe, getting one in <i>every</i> 200 people in the world killed (his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars_casualties\">namesake wars</a> were the same size, though not the same shape, as the Holocaust), becoming one of the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/napoleon-was-the-best-general-ever-and-the-math-proves-it-86efed303eeb\">most successful generals in history</a>? \r\n    \r\nDwyer's answer is via various sorts of creativity: nepotism, plagiarism, disloyalty, false advertising, ignoring orders (and then going AWOL to avoid reprisal), and but also actual military acumen.\r\n\r\nThis is true but the broader answer is: with the help of all the revolutionaries whose violence he used. The Corsican freedom fighters, the mob, the fucked-up Jacobins, and the Thermidorians each broke France, creating a ladder of corpses for people like Boney. (This feat is repeated by psychos in most revolutions.) He made general at 26 through an unearned political appointment, and was given absolute command of 63,000 men soon after. \r\n\r\nDwyer is out to get Napoleon: he sees propaganda everywhere (even in Boney's private diary, aged 18). The whole book is obsessed with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism\">Construction</a> of Napoleon - for instance, did you know that when he won a battle, <i>he told people about it expecting praise</i>?  This sentence, or its proposition, is repeated more than a hundred times:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    This encounter [with a prostitute] is taken by most historians at face value, but it is entirely possible that the account is fictional, nothing more than a fanciful exercise of the pen.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n    Of course it's possible, but so what? What is its probability? (I continue to read nonfiction which isn't data-driven - more fool me, I suppose.) It's weird to feel annoyed by the hypercritical spirit; I'm usually on the other side of this fence. \r\n\r\nDwyer is at least jargon-free. And Napoleon certainly lies all the time - to his rivals, his friends, and to posterity. An odd case: both genius and fraud - a genius of dishonesty. (Like Edison?)\r\n\r\nMuch of this long book is just a prose list of events, many of them insignificant (not to say prurient). There is basically no military detail - most of the major battles get half a page. Fine as reference work maybe.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<i>Misc:</i> \r\n\r\n* I knew that standing armies of the day were rammed full of pillagers, rapists, and thieves, but I was surprised to find that their generals were little better - Napoleon extracted about 80 million francs (maybe half a billion dollars?) from the Italians he conquered, under the name \"requisitions\". \r\n(This is many times the tax rate of the previous Austrian occupiers.)\r\n\r\n* The many portraits of N are comically dissimilar - simply because done by artists who had never seen him or any image of him.   \r\n\r\n* His romantic insecurity is also surprising: he writes to Josephine much more than she replies, and is constantly crestfallen to find her gone without saying where.\r\n\r\n* \"<a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/\">Jacobin</a>\" is a terrible choice of name for a social justice magazine. It's more like \"Khmer Rouge Weekly\" or \"the Daily Witchfinder\" than anything laudable: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=30EEq8R2feIC&pg=PA617&dq=40000+reign+of+terror&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSgYOtyongAhUkrXEKHUuUBZoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=40000&f=false\">~40,000</a> executed or left to rot and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_the_Vend%C3%A9e\">a hundred thousand in the Vendée</a>, mostly religious peasants, <i>as well as</i> atrocities like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drownings_at_Nantes\">mass slow drownings</a>). The Jacobins deserve some share of Napoleon's millions of dead too - for all that N was only pretending to be a Jacobin. \r\n\r\nOf course, the revolution nominally ended feudalism, redistributed land, and claimed to establish human rights. But we know in hindsight that this could have been done without killing 1% of the country and 0.6% of everyone alive - for instance, it was in Britain, and it was by earlier and later French republicans. So you got some nicer rhetoric in exchange for millions of gallons of blood.       \r\n\r\nIt suits me to call the Jacobins a perversion of the Enlightenment. This has <a href=\"https://quillette.com/2018/03/11/steven-pinkers-counter-counter-enlightenment/\">lately been characterised</a> as a trick - if it's wrong for <i>Jacobin</i> to cherry-pick the bits they like about the Jacobins (anger, radicalisation, protest marches, beautiful lip-service to egalitarianism) then it's wrong for me to say they're not really part of 'the Enlightenment'. But it is a sick joke of history that Montesquieu's rage at torture, Condorcet's rational politics, and Bentham's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham#Gender_and_sexuality\">impressive moral generosity</a> must share a name with these torturing and bigoted totalitarians.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://revueperiode.net/jacobin-magazine-entretien-avec-bhaskar-sunkara/\">But why is <i>Jacobin</i> called <i>Jacobin</i>? </a>\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nIn the United States, most people do not associate the term with a particular political group. It sounds vaguely radical... I had heard the word as a child: my parents... had copies of CLR James' Black Jacobins at home. In reality, it was not more thoughtful or premeditated than that! For the artistic director Remeike Forbes who was born in Jamaica, the term refers to the same book... \"Bolshevik\" would not be bad as a title in fact!

    "review": "Pretty funny, maybe the first bit of cultural anthropology I've liked (because it is low-level and in fact exasperatingly empirical). Here is her on her own tribe: \n\n<blockquote><i>\nthe... currently fashionable practice  is  to devote at least a chapter of  your book or Ph.D. thesis to a tortured, self-flagellating disquisition on the ethical and methodological difficulties  of   participant  observation.  Although  the  whole  point  of   the  participant  element  is  to  understand  the  culture  from  a  ‘native’ perspective, you must spend a good three pages explaining that your unconscious  ethnocentric  prejudices,  and  various  other  cultural  barriers,  probably  make  this  impossible.  It  is  then  customary  to  question  the  entire  moral  basis  of   the  observation  element,  and,  ideally,  to  express  grave  reservations  about  the  validity  of   modern  Western  ‘science’  as  a  means  of   understanding  anything  at  all. \n\nAt  this  point,  the  uninitiated  reader  might  legitimately  wonder  why  we  continue  to  use  a  research  method  that  is  clearly  either  morally  questionable  or  unreliable  or  both.  I  wondered  this  myself,  until I realised that these doleful recitations of  the dangers and evils of   participant  observation  are  a  form  of   protective  mantra,  a  ritual  chant  similar  to  the  rather  charming  practice  of   some  Native  American tribes who, before setting out on a hunt or chopping down a  tree,  would  sing  apologetic  laments  to  appease  the  spirits  of   the  animals  they  were  about  to  kill  or  the  tree  they  were  about  to  fell.  \n\nA  less  charitable  interpretation  would  see  anthropologists’  ritual  self-abasements  as  a  disingenuous  attempt  to  deflect  criticism  by  pre-emptive confession of  their failings – like the selfish and neglectful lover  who  says,  ‘Oh,  I’m  such  a  bastard,  I  don’t  know  why  you  put  up  with  me,’  relying  on  our  belief   that  such  awareness  and  candid acknowledgement  of   a  fault  is  almost  as  virtuous  as  not  having  it.  \n\nBut whatever the motives, conscious or otherwise, the ritual chapter agonising   over   the   role   of    the   participant   observer   tends   to   be mind-numbingly tedious...\n</blockquote></i>\n\n    Even with a style like that, this gets repetitive. But her explicit decoding would be so, so helpful to incomers or neuroatypicals. She is particularly good on the subtle way that class is central in Britain (not \"no oiks allowed\" but rather \"can he choose and pronounce the word 'toilet' \").\n",

She’d spent decades— the best part of her second life —fighting nuclear proliferation. Starting out as a dreadlocked direct-action activist, chaining herself to fences, secure in the naive youthful belief that no harm could befall her. Later, she figured out that the way to do it was wearing a smart suit, with mercenary soldiers and the threat of canceled insurance policies backing up her quiet voice. Still prickly and direct, but less of a knee-jerk nonconformist, she’d learned to work the system for maximum effect. The hydra seemed halfway under control, bombings down to only one every couple of years, when Bertil had summoned her to Geneva and offered her a new job. Then she’d wished she’d paid more attention to the cosmologist—for the Algerian Latter-Day Saints had been very thorough in their suppression of the Tiplerite heresy-but it was too late, and in any event, the minutiae of the Standing Committee’s investigations into chronological and probabilistic warfare beckoned...\n\nShe’d done her share of shooting, too, or at least directing the machinery of preemptive vengeance, wiping out more than one cell of atomic-empowered fanatics—whether central-Asian independence fighters, freelance meres with a bomb too many in their basement, or on one notable occasion, radical pro-lifers willing to go to any lengths to protect the unborn child. Idealism couldn’t coexist with so many other people’s ideals, betrayed in their execution by the tools they’d chosen. She’d walked through Manchester three days after the Inter-City Firm’s final kickoff, before the rain had swept the sad mounds of cinders and bone from the blasted streets.\n</blockquote></i>\n\nFun, but not nearly as mind-bending as his or Egan or Vinge's best.\n\nEvery few months Stross lets rip apocalyptic prophecy <a href=\"https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/05/happy-21st-century.html\">on his blog</a>.

    "review": "\nExcellent, sceptical look at near-future tech, their enormous potential and risk. The technologies are: new ways of getting to space, asteroid mining, fusion power, programmable matter, robotic construction, brain-computer interfaces, synthetic biology, and bioprinting. They tend to be bearish about these technologies, because their default (i.e. unregulated) effects could be really dreadful. \n\n(Excepting robo-construction and organ printing because these are much less dangerous and dodgy than the existing hacks.) My favourite bit is the paean to Alvin Roth's organ-swap algorithm, which is a magnificent way of circumventing human squeamishness.\n\nLots of direct quotation from the unprepossessing scientists doing all this, <3. There are also lots of addenda of the following sort:\n<blockquote><i>\n    The story of Gerald Bull goes like this. You have a brilliant engineer who's especially good at ballistics at an early age, who had a brilliant career early on where he got funding from Canada and the US to work on these ballistics programs. Then basically the funding dried up. So he kind of did whatever it took to be able to keep working in this area, which led him to do work in weapons dealing, including dealing with then apartheid South Africa. And things basically unraveled from there, resulting in his humiliation and depression and alcoholism.\n\n    Then much later in life he began working for Saddam Hussein, building, for reasons that are not well understood, a giant gun. To be clear, it was probably not useful as a weapon. It was not going to be moveable, it was not pointing at an enemy city: it was pointing as the Earth turns, which is what you'd want to do if you were shooting into space. Then, shortly after that, in the early ‘90s he ended up in a Brussels hotel with a bullet in his head and $20,000 on his body, and nobody is sure who killed him. I believe his son suspected Mossad, but no one as far as I can find has come forward to say here's who did it. \n</blockquote></i>\n\nSuitable for all ages, knob jokes aside. (There's a segue joke at the end of every block, and they are uniformly a bit forced.) The illustrations actually don't add anything, even though I love SMBC.",

Particularly good if, like me, you've struggled with the plaintext. \n\nKeys:\n\n<blockquote><i>\n    Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. \n</blockquote></i>\n\n<blockquote><i>\n    Looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all the species of the same group together, must assuredly have existed; but the very process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often remarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links. Consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains \n</blockquote></i>\n\n<blockquote><i>\n    There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved. \n</blockquote></i>\n(That last sentence had \"by the Creator\" tacked on in the second edition.)\n\nYou would never guess the prose was written in a rush: possibly because the arguments were formed at the slowest possible rate.",

Art about code. So this is conceptualism that I don't immediately despise.\r\n\r\n    (A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)\">closure</a> is a neat piece of code that can remember what has happened, knows what's going on outside, beyond what the code explicitly mentions.)\r\n\r\nWe get dead-format nostalgia, memery, a handwritten stretch of Ruby, and reflections on feeling inferior to Franz Kafka, of all people.\r\n\r\n    _why has a unique voice. That is a banal thing to say, but it is true here as I suspect it is not elsewhere. There are only two technical passages, one litany of relief from enterprise development, and one entire module in handwriting.\r\n\r\n    There is torment. Keep up the names: he is the Simon Weil, the Tristram Shandy of web development, the DFW of running out of ritalin. Unquiet introversion.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nCan anyone that has had a blog be called private? (Where are all the introverts these days? Technology has upgraded introverts into - soft extroverts I guess.)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n Here are his self-hating notes in the margin of his beautiful, kind comment on Shymalan's <i>The Happening</i>:\r\n<blockquote>    \r\n   Perhaps the greatest pain of talking about art is how shallow it is compared to the actual experience of watching movie/song/etc...    previously I had criticized the kinds of small talk discussions, particularly discussions about music, because they revolved around \"Did you like this? Have you heard that?\" and never went anywhere beyond that... \r\n\r\nThose pointless discussions that had always left me feeling empty, never able to talk about the beauty of music itself adequately, just the names and the styles... But why would anyone want to have a meaningful discussion all the time?\r\n\r\n        In a way I feel that's the point of being candid. To expose how shameful I am.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n    Wilfully awkward, marginal, analogue.     He calls himself the Professor, as an insult.\r\nThe PDF is of images, not text: you cannot copy anything without putting in the effort. Old misaligned book scans, dumb Gorey cartoon jokes, an itemized grocery bill, astute literary notes on Kafka, Ishiguro, Gaiman. He lives now with extreme thrift and extreme technophobia, slamming down his friend's phone when she browses it during conversation. He makes seawater bread instead of web apps. \r\n\r\nThe harsh jump-cut absurdism between the sketches is not genuine - they are all linked. Not sure what by, but I say so.\r\n<blockquote>        \r\nI must strictly require you that, if you are to continue reading and go with me on this sally, that you resist from looking up anything to do with the book SACRED CLOWNS. This is paramount. I know the urge must be incredible to go out with your smartphones and to find out if the book is real, but I must INSIST that you just let it be. I don't know if it's possible for you to exercise that kind of self-restraint in this modern age, but you must. Of all the things I could ask of you, this seems so small and simple. Can you do this for me?\r\n</blockquote>\r\n(I did resist, but it was actually hard to.)\r\n\r\n        I usually don't rate merely formal experiment, intentional awkwardness. But the warmth of his great first book and the constant self-deprecation and plaintive concrete detail make it easy.\r\n<blockquote>\r\n        \"What's your name?\"\r\n        \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff#Real_identity\">I won't say</a>\"\r\n        \"It's just a name, mate! Doesn't mean anything to hide it!\r\n        \"It doesn't mean anything to say it!\" I yelled\r\n</blockquote>\r\n    Someone is <a href=\"http://whytheluckystiff.net/\">squatting his old site</a>.

    "review": "Has an ingenious structure: starting with a piece of behaviour, work backwards through the many scales that caused it: from the nerve bundles that enable the muscle motion, through the brain processing that ordered those, through that morning's hormonal predisposing, foetal genetic construction, all the way to the ancestral environment.\r\n\r\nSapolsky is engagingly cranky about various things: traditional misogynies, war. He uses the neologism \"pseudospeciation\" (i.e. the dehumanising kind of racism) about 50 times.\r\n\r\nHe is often thrillingly unimpressed:\r\n<blockquote><i> Jane Goodall blew everyone's socks off by reporting the now-iconic fact that chimps make tools... Most cultural anthropologists weren't thrilled by Goodall's revolution, and now emphasise definitions that cut chimps and other hoi polloi out of the party. There's a fondness for the thinking of Alfred Kroeber, Clyde Kluckhohn, and Clifford Geertz, three heavyweights who focused on how culture is about ideas and symbols, rather than the mere behaviours in which they instantiate, or material products like flint blades or iPhones... \r\n\r\nBasically, I don't want to go anywhere near these debates. For our purposes we'll rely on an intuitive definition of culture emphasised by Frans de Waal: culture is how we do and think about things.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nBut he's way too credulous about social science. For instance, I recommend skipping the last half of chapter 3, on social psychology, entirely. In the space of two pages (p90-1) he cites <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797616658563?journalCode=pssa\">power</a> <a href=\"http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/dana_carney/pdf_my%20position%20on%20power%20poses.pdf\">pose</a>, <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691616674458\">facial feedback</a>, <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691616652873\">ego </a><a href=\"http://www.psy.miami.edu/ehblab/PubBiasSelfControlEgo.pdf\">depletion</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094715300517\">himmicanes</a>; all as exciting, uncontroversial fact. This is a clean sweep of recent studies <i>well-known</i> to be p-hacked, low-power and spurious. \r\n\r\nHe also endorses the results of <a href=\"https://qz.com/1144504/the-world-is-relying-on-a-flawed-psychological-test-to-fight-racism/\">Implicit Association</a> and stereotype threat tests far too strongly. I don't know enough about neuroscience or endocrinology or ethology to make a similar recommendation for the other chapters. But the \"<a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2011/08/the-murray-gell-mann-amnesia-effect/\">Gell-Mann amnesia</a>\" effect sadly suggests that we should (partially) discount everything else in here, primates aside; evidence of credulity in one domain is evidence for others.\r\n\r\n(Best case, he just didn't keep up with the latest research dramas. Though some results, like the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/322/5908/1681\">litter -> theft link</a> or <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973533.2013.856792\">the Macbeth effect</a>, have been <a href=\"https://eprints.qut.edu.au/38329/\">comprehensively</a> <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1368430213502557\">criticised</a> for 8+ years now, so.)\r\n\r\nHe also takes anthropologists at their qualitative, cherry-picking word when they try to maintain their academic boundary against Pinker's work on violence.\r\n\r\nStill worth it for his first-hand stories - him watching Somali oil workers conduct ritual argument, him watching a troop of baboons spread a culture - a pocket of pacifism and gender sanity in the psychotic roundabout of nature.\r\n\r\nMinus 1 point because his empirical judgments are unreliable. : (",

As a former socialist finance minister, he has a healthy blend of actual economic knowledge and smouldering will to improve an irrational status quo. (He uses \"irrational\" <i>far</i> more than the usual pejoratives: \"greedy\" or \"exploitative\" or \"neoliberal\".) \r\n\r\nHe makes lots of literary allusions and shares personal tales of fascist Greece. These make the deadly dull business of postwar European monetary politics readable. He talks about the duty of surplus nations to stabilize the world system, which is true and good but unworkable. He has a remarkable admiration for American institutions and figures - not just the New Dealers, but also, in a way, for Volcker and Geithner - while also pointing out astutely. Full marks for tone, basically. \r\n\r\n    A good writer, with only a couple of wrongfooted sentences. Potted history of post-war international macroeconomics. \r\n\r\n    His policies do not much resemble socialism: all the same neoliberal institutions exist in Varoufakisland. He'd just use them to help the vulnerable. \r\n\r\n    America (Harry White, Volcker) had a chance to stabilise the world, but instead grabbed national interest at the expense of others. Then - according to Varoufakis - they grabbed hegemony at the expense of their own, which is even more depressing.\r\n\r\nHis current-account focussed theory is a bit narrow. There is already a eurozone surplus recycling mechanism, for instance. His 2015 Greek finance policies continue to look better than the current blind bailout plus permadeflation solution: Greece should have defaulted. His (and Holland's) recommendations are very sensible.\r\n\r\nDespite being short, it is really repetitive; I skimmed chapters 4-6 heavily. It is also disappointingly short on <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?dcr=0&ei=tPArWvfTNYLjUZaFqrAG&q=geithner+%22foot+on+the+neck%22&oq=geithner+%22foot+on+the+neck%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3...20157.22901.0.23060.4.4.0.0.0.0.237.567.0j2j1.3.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.0.0....0.E3lBGUarhPE\">private gossip</a> about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_troika\">dark back-corridors</a> of Brussels; he saved that for the next book.",

I've to ascribe it to the fact that people in England seem to have a much better sense of personal space... They don't feel entitled to invade your territory the way Americans do - perhaps they just scratched that itch with the whole British Empire thing.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI was intrigued to learn that Brando was a compulsive consequentialist:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n  I said the only way to get [Brando] was to... tell him we'd pay him $2 million, but only if we could give the money direct to the American Indians. I think we would've got him that way, because his own moral scheme would have left him no option but to accept.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe first thing about him I like.\r\n\r\nHere is one real hallucination:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n...people will often be telling me that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnon_Milchan#Intelligence_operative\">my producer</a> is a bit of an operator, and my reply to them is generally \"Well, that may very well be true, but I'm only interested in one thing, and that's getting the film done - whether or not I get screwed in the process\"... we got two films made together, and no amount of documentaries about his pivotal role in the Israeli nuclear weapons programme can change that.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b>3/5.</b>.

The human cost of credential inflation and hegemonic education. \n<blockquote>\n        our society views college not as a consumer product at all, but as both a surefire, can’t-lose financial investment and, even more crucial than that, a moral imperative.\n</blockquote>\n\n45% of the 20 million annual enrolments do not finish the course.

Because of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheepskin_effect\">the sheepskin effect</a> - part of a degree is not worth much to the job market - and the low social return on completed education, this means billions of dollars, and millions of years of life wasted.

I suppose this made him a star because honesty and filth are rare in high cuisine, or in the received notion of high cuisine. He refers to himself as a \"cook\" throughout (or even \"cookie\"), endearingly. \n\nAnyone else playing at being a junkie cuisinier, sexual tyrannosaurus, smash-hit author, primetime travel host, and, most recently, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmgRXUmYncE\">jiujitsu japer</a> would surely be risible.

    "review": "Like a lot of great philosophy, <i>Superintelligence</i> acts as a space elevator: you make many small, reasonable, careful movements - and you suddenly find yourself in outer space, home comforts far below. It is more rigorous about a topic which doesn't exist than you would think possible. \r\n\r\nI didn't find it hard to read, but I have been marinating in tech rationalism for a few years and have absorbed much of Bostrom secondhand so YMMV.\r\n\r\nI loved this:\r\n<blockquote><i>Many of the points made in this book are probably wrong. It is also likely that there are considerations of critical importance that I fail to take into account, thereby invalidating some or all of my conclusions. I have gone to some length to indicate nuances and degrees of uncertainty throughout the text — encumbering it with an unsightly smudge of “possibly,” “might,” “may,” “could well,” “it seems,” “probably,” “very likely,” “almost certainly.” Each qualifier has been placed where it is carefully and deliberately. Yet these topical applications of epistemic modesty are not enough; they must be supplemented here by a systemic admission of uncertainty and fallibility. This is not false modesty: for while I believe that my book is likely to be seriously wrong and misleading, I think that the alternative views that have been presented in the literature are substantially worse - including the default view, according to which we can for the time being reasonably ignore the prospect of superintelligence.</i></blockquote> \r\nBostrom introduces <a href=\"http://aiimpacts.org/ai-risk-terminology/\">dozens of neologisms</a> and many arguments. Here is the main scary apriori one though:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n1. Just being intelligent doesn't imply being benign; intelligence and goals can be independent. (<i>the orthogonality thesis</i>.)\r\n2. Any agent which seeks resources and lacks explicit moral programming would default to dangerous behaviour. You are made of things it can use; <i>hate</i> is superfluous. (<i>Instrumental convergence</i>.) \r\n3. It is conceivable that AIs might gain capability very rapidly through recursive self-improvement. (<i>Non-negligible possibility of a hard takeoff.</i>)\r\n4. Since AIs will not be automatically nice, would by default do harmful things, and could obtain a lot of power very quickly*, AI safety is morally significant, deserving public funding, serious research, and international scrutiny.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nOf far broader interest than its title (and that argument) might suggest to you. In particular, it is the best introduction I've seen to the new, shining <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory\">decision sciences</a> - an undervalued reinterpretation of old, vague ideas which, until recently, you only got to see if you read statistics, <i>and</i> economics, <i>and</i> the crunchier side of psychology. It is also a history of humanity, a thoughtful treatment of psychometrics v genetics, and a rare objective estimate of the worth of large organisations, past and future.\r\n\r\n<i>Superintelligence</i>'s main purpose is moral: he wants us to worry and act urgently about hypotheticals; given this rhetorical burden, his tone too is a triumph. \r\n<blockquote><i>For a child with an undetonated bomb in its hands, a sensible thing to do would be to put it down gently, quickly back out of the room, and contact the nearest adult. Yet what we have here is not one child but many, each with access to an independent trigger mechanism. The chances that we will all find the sense to put down the dangerous stuff seem almost negligible. Some little idiot is bound to press the ignite button just to see what happens. Nor can we attain safety by running away, for the blast of an intelligence explosion would bring down the firmament. Nor is there a grown-up in sight... \r\n\r\nThis is not a prescription of fanaticism. The intelligence explosion might still be many decades off in the future. Moreover, the challenge we face is, in part, to hold on to our humanity: to maintain our groundedness, common sense, and goodhumored decency even in the teeth of this most unnatural and inhuman problem. We need to bring all human resourcefulness to bear on its solution. \r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nI don't donate to AI safety orgs, despite caring about the best way to improve the world and despite having no argument against it better than \"that's not how software has worked so far\" and despite the <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/22/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk/\">concern of smart experts</a>. This sober, kindly book made me realise this was more to do with fear of sneering than noble scepticism or empathy.\r\n\r\n[EDIT 2019: Reader, I married this cause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>* People sometimes choke on this point, but note that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto\">the first intelligence</a> to obtain half a billion dollars virtually, anonymously, purely via mastery of maths occurred... just now. Robin Hanson <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/07/30855.html#more-30855\">chokes eloquently here</a> and for god's sake let's hope he's right.\r\n</blockquote>",

I feel perfectly fair in explaining their rancour by his skilful scientific intrusion on their ill-tended turf. (Diamond was originally an ornithologist and geneticist.)\r\n\r\nEngaging and original as it is, his thesis faces a hard explanatory limit: agriculture has not been the limiting factor on economies for more than 200 years, and yet the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divergence\">Great Divergence</a> dates from then and not earlier. Diamond could appeal to simple path-dependency: \"we win now because we won then\" or argue that the technological and military edge yielded land, and that land yielded the economic miracle. But the evidence (also known as Gregory Clark) certainly does not warrant crop or zoological supremacism.\r\n\r\nAnyway I know of no better introduction to cultural evolution theory, human population genetics, the Clovis / pre-Clovis controversy, philology, New Guinean traditionalism, the origins and downsides of civilization, animal husbandry, and the ancient history of Africa. The rub is that you can't stop with him, because he doesn't go for all the angles.\r\n\r\n<i>In one sentence</i>: See Q&A above.\r\n\r\n<br /><b>4/5</b> (minus a half for awful references - vague, without page numbers in the text or in the source, nor footnotes).</li>\r\n",

If you compare the output of the first half of his life to the second, sure it looks bad. But he was giving classical physics (determinism, continuousness, simplicity, fierce parsimony, beauty-based reasoning) a well-deserved last shake. \r\n\r\nImagine the strength of will needed to maintain full-time effort over thirty years of failures, with your whipsmart peers all tutting and ignoring you. His <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_unified_field_theories#Einstein.27s_geometric_approaches\">unified field</a> efforts are methodologically sort of like string theory: a hubristic search over mathematical forms without contact with the actually physical to help limit the formal space.\r\n\r\nAnd he actually had a decent decision-theoretic argument for his doomed crusade:\r\n<blockquote> <i>When a colleague asked him one day why he was spending — perhaps squandering — his time in this lonely endeavor, he replied that even if the chance of finding a unified theory was small, the attempt was worthy. He had already made his name, he noted. His position was secure, and he could afford to take the risk and expend the time. A younger theorist, however, could not take such a risk, for he might thus sacrifice a promising career. So, Einstein said, it was his duty to do it.</i></blockquote>\r\nPeople also try to attach shame to him for his wildly stubborn anti-Copenhagen crusade: years spent thinking up tricky counterexamples for the young mechanicians, like an angry philosopher. But I think he had a good effect on the discourse, constantly calling them to order, and leaving it clear, after all, that it <i>is</i> a consistent view of the evidence. \r\n\r\nThe only unforgiveable bit in his later conservatism is that he ignored the other half of the fundamental forces, the strong and weak forces, and for decades. Two forces was hard enough to unify. I suppose another point against his long, long Advanced Studies is that he could have done even more if he had helped <i>push</i> QM along; as late as 1946, Wheeler tried to convince him to join in. As it is we have evidence against the unified field: \"<i>Einstein</i> failed\".\r\n\r\n<center>**************************************************</center>\r\n\r\nEinstein is like Bertrand Russell, only <i>much</i> more so: even more brilliant, even more rebellious, even more politically active, even more aloof, even more relentless, even more neglectful of his family. (Russell, on hearing relativity for the first time: \"<i>To think I have spent my life on absolute muck</i>.\") \r\n\r\nAlong with Ibn Rushd, Leonardo, Pascal, Leibniz, Darwin, Peirce, Russell, Turing, Chomsky, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._C._MacKay\">Mackay</a>*, Einstein is one of our rare <i>complete</i> intellectuals: huge achievements in science, beautiful writing, good jokes, original philosophy, moral seriousness. To have warmth too, as Einstein does abundantly, doesn't have much of a precedent. However much Einstein is <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=einstein+quotes&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipzLzD8NTUAhXESRoKHbMsC4MQ_AUIBigB&biw=1091&bih=561\">misattributed</a> vaguely pleasant, vaguely droll, vaguely radical statements, the fact is he actually <i>was</i> brilliant, pleasant, funny, radical. Believe the hype.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"padding:30px\">\r\n* The usual word is 'polymath', sure, but although we are mad keen on polymaths, their generalism is seen as a laudable extra, rather than the <i>vital</i> service I now think they alone can give: you want people who have proven they can discover truths to tackle your ancient ill-defined questions (beauty, justice, existence). \r\n\r\n<p>And you can't do good unless you <i>know</i> a great deal about the targets of your morals; you want the vast imaginative search over philosophical possibilities to be aided by what we actually know. (As the noted writer against scientism, Ludwig Wittgenstein <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=Last+Writings+on+the+Philosophy+of+Psychology#q=%22scientific+progress+useful%22+Last+Writings+on+the+Philosophy+of+Psychology\">put it</a>: \r\n<blockquote>\r\n   Is scientific progress useful for philosophy? Certainly. The realities that are discovered lighten the philosopher’s task: imagining possibilities.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Maxwell, Boltzmann, Schrödinger, and Feynman basically fit the above: they are as good at writing and philosophy as they are at physics, and very funny to boot. But they didn't push society forward much (...) Goethe tried admirably, but didn't achieve much science. Descartes should definitely be on there but eh. Hilary Putnam discovered important logical results and has all the other virtues, but I guess science is a stretch?. von Neumann covered perhaps the most intellectual ground of all of these people, but I'm not sure he had a moral or political life to speak of. Herbert Simon is deep and broad and fun. And Bohr is brilliant and moral but can't write.</p>\r\n\r\n(There's others I'd include, but won't because I know I'm a fanboy** / it is too soon to say: Scott Aaronson, David Pearce, Nick Bostrom.)\r\n\r\n<div style=\"padding:30px\">\r\n    ** A new Moore's paradox: \"I know I'm a fanboy, but my thinker is still better than your thinker.\"\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<center>********************************************</center>\r\n\r\nWhat was so moral about him? Well, he was ahead of his time (still is): \r\n<ul>\r\n- <li>Denounced WWI as the senseless crap it was.</li>\r\n- <li>Never went to the Soviet empire (despite repeated invites).</li>\r\n- <li>Denounced the Nazis from '31, despite/because of public threats to his life.</li>\r\n- <li>Flipped from pacifism at the right moment.</li>\r\n- <li>Many early actions for <a href=\"http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/04/albert-einstein-civil-rights-activist/\">US civil rights</a>, including work against McCarthyism.</li>\r\n- <li>Sold his original manuscripts for War Bonds</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEven his Zionism was enlightened (pro-migration, anti-state, <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_Palestine_Party;_Visit_of_Menachen_Begin_and_Aims_of_Political_Movement_Discussed\">anti-Begin</a>):\r\n<blockquote>“<i>Should we be unable to find a way to honest cooperation and honest pacts with the Arabs,</i>” he wrote [Chaim] Weizmann in 1929, “<i>then we have learned absolutely nothing during our 2,000 years of suffering.</i>”\r\n\r\nHe proposed, both to Weizmann and in an open letter to an Arab leader, that a “privy council” of four Jews and four Arabs, all independent-minded, be set up to resolve any disputes. “<i>The two great Semitic peoples,</i>” he said, “<i>have a great common future.</i>” If the Jews did not assure that both sides lived in harmony, he warned friends in the Zionist movement, the struggle would haunt them in decades to come. Once again, he was labeled naïve.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<center>**********************************************</center>\r\n\r\n\r\nOne particularly charming bit in this book covers Einstein's long friendship with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_of_Bavaria,_Queen_of_Belgium\">Queen Mother of Belgium</a>. When Szilard warns him that nuclear fission has been achieved and could give the Nazis dominion over all, Einstein's first thought is to ask Elisabeth to sort it out, by grabbing all the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_overseas_colonies\">Central African</a> uranium and sending it far from the Nazis. (As it happens, the <i>Uranverein</i> got their uranium from Czechoslovakia.)\r\n\r\n<center>******************************************</center>\r\n\r\nIsaacson read all the letters, formed a view on all the academic controversies (Maric's contribution, baby Lieserl, what sort of deist or Zionist or pacifist he was), and covers most of the papers, recasting the classic thought experiments very lucidly. This was a huge pleasure. Read with Wikipedia open, though: C20th physics and its physicists are way too deep and broad for one book.\r\n",

    "review": "So lucid. 'Killing an Elephant' is, surprisingly, the most powerful animal rights essay I've read in years.\n\nI think he'd struggle to get his essay on Dali published these days, maybe not even in the Spectator: we aren't able to think of art in these moral terms any more:\n\n<blockquote><i>\n        [Dali's autobiography] is a book that stinks. If it were possible for a book to give a physical stink off its pages, this one would — a thought that might please Dali, who before wooing his future wife for the first time rubbed himself all over with an ointment made of goat's dung boiled up in fish glue. But against this has to be set the fact that Dali is a draughtsman of very exceptional gifts. He is also, to judge by the minuteness and the sureness of his drawings, a very hard worker. He is an exhibitionist and a careerist, but he is not a fraud. He has fifty times more talent than most of the people who would denounce his morals and jeer at his paintings. And these two sets of facts, taken together, raise a question which for lack of any basis of agreement seldom gets a real discussion.\n        \nThe point is that you have here a direct, unmistakable assault on sanity and decency; and even — since some of Dali's pictures would tend to poison the imagination like a pornographic postcard — on life itself. What Dali has done and what he has imagined is debatable, but in his outlook, his character, the bedrock decency of a human being does not exist. He is as anti-social as a flea. Clearly, such people are undesirable, and a society in which they can flourish has something wrong with it.\n\n        Now, if you showed this book, with its illustrations, to Lord Elton, to Mr. Alfred Noyes, to The Times leader writers who exult over the ‘eclipse of the highbrow’ — in fact, to any ‘sensible’ art-hating English person — it is easy to imagine what kind of response you would get. They would flatly refuse to see any merit in Dali whatever. Such people are not only unable to admit that what is morally degraded can be жsthetically right, but their real demand of every artist is that he shall pat them on the back and tell them that thought is unnecessary. And they can be especially dangerous at a time like the present, when the Ministry of Information and the British Council put power into their hands. For their impulse is not only to crush every new talent as it appears, but to castrate the past as well. Witness the renewed highbrow-baiting that is now going on in this country and America, with its outcry not only against Joyce, Proust and Lawrence, but even against T. S. Eliot.\n\n        But if you talk to the kind of person who can see Dali's merits, the response that you get is not as a rule very much better. If you say that Dali, though a brilliant draughtsman, is a dirty little scoundrel, you are looked upon as a savage. If you say that you don't like rotting corpses, and that people who do like rotting corpses are mentally diseased, it is assumed that you lack the жsthetic sense. Since ‘Mannequin rotting in a taxicab’ is a good composition. And between these two fallacies there is no middle position, but we seldom hear much about it. On the one side Kulturbolschevismus: on the other (though the phrase itself is out of fashion) ‘Art for Art's sake.’ Obscenity is a very difficult question to discuss honestly. People are too frightened either of seeming to be shocked or of seeming not to be shocked, to be able to define the relationship between art and morals.\n\n        suppose that you have nothing in you except your egoism and a dexterity that goes no higher than the elbow; suppose that your real gift is for a detailed, academic, representational style of drawing, your real métier to be an illustrator of scientific textbooks. How then do you become Napoleon? There is always one escape: into wickedness. Always do the thing that will shock and wound people. At five, throw a little boy off a bridge, strike an old doctor across the face with a whip and break his spectacles — or, at any rate, dream about doing such things. Twenty years later, gouge the eyes out of dead donkeys with a pair of scissors. Along those lines you can always feel yourself original. And after all, it pays! ... If you threw dead donkeys at people, they threw money back. \n    </blockquote></i>",

    "review": "How did the Roman empire last so long with leaders like this?\n\nSeneca is complex, if by complex you mean \"among the most contradictory people in history\". He was a vocal ascetic and one of the richest men in the world. He was a beautiful exponent of liberty and prudence, and a shill for an insane rapist for a decade - but it would have worse to abandon Rome to Nero and his rapey mates. Thrasea Paetus is the respective true stoic, the noble abstainer.\n\n\nClassic historian move: when dealing with possibilities that don't appeal to him, Romm just hems and haws and says that they're implausible; I'm not even mad. He also reports very dubious \"evidence\" via Dio and Tacitus, like the content of private conversations between Agrippina and Nero with no one else present. \n\nSense of doom on Seneca's family throughout, including his blameless nephew.  Why didn't they run? They were so rich, and the government was so much smaller and poorly-informed.",

But at least there’s underlying math, plus experimental evidence from cognitive psychology on how humans actually think. Maybe that will be enough to cross the stratospherically high threshold required for a discipline that lets you actually get it right, instead of just constraining you to interesting new mistakes.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>everyone needs to learn at least one technical subject. Physics; computer science; evolutionary biology; or Bayesian probability theory, but something.

An ongoing concern. \r\n\r\nYudkowsky’s writing suffers from this thing where we incorporate the ideas, but everyone begrudges the insight they glean from him and forget they thought otherwise. This is perhaps because his site carried a heavy pall of nerdiness (fan-fiction and <a href=\"http://carcinisation.com/2014/07/21/bestiary-entry-rokos-basilisk/\">Streisanding</a>), a status deficit which prevents people from according the ideas their actual merit. His dismissive attitude to high-status people and ideas also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXARrMadTKk\">drives a lot</a> of people crazy, sometimes making them unable to care if the ideas are right. So we minimise his contribution to the life of the new mind, some of the brightest prospects in the dark world. This is unfair but the new mind is the main thing, and broader than him already.\r\n\r\nThe section intros by Rob Bensinger, written a decade later, are helpful, but this book may need refreshing every decade, because of the replication crisis. This is no insult.<br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>*Some of Yudkowsky's new ideas (not the mere popularisations):\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The abstract <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/research/\">research chain</a> into FAI: i.e. logical uncertainty, tiling, corrigibility, value learning.

    "review": "Big, moving dynasty novel about a future class war. Elitism vs racism, individualism vs collectivism, negative freedom vs positive freedom, UBI and/or dignity. Kress' stated goal is to bring together Rand's ideal and Le Guin's (ambiguous) ideal and see how they spark off each other, their repulsion dance.\r\n\r\nThe first two books seem simple: a good basic dramatisation of the excellence vs equality problem. But stick with it, dialectic comes. Kress is much better at inhabiting other views than Rand, but not quite as good as Le Guin (who surprised me with how ambivalent, careful and detached her books can be, when her essays are so often blunt and denunciatory). Unlike them, Kress allows her ubermenschen to be irrational, as when the Sleepers fall into stupid binary demonisation of the majority outgroup. <spoiler>The Sanctuary bunch start as Objectivists, but are twisted by Jennifer's wealth and terrorism into the worst totalitarian collectivism - one without even pity for misfortune.</spoiler>\r\n\r\nShe climbs inside libertarianism, productivism, Objectivism, elitism - half of the protagonists are deeply, unreflectively into these ideologies for half the book. Leisha finds one fatal flaw with them - society is not a linear series of contracts but a chaotic informal web of micro-contracts and unthinking mutual structuration, with a thin layer of formal voluntary contracts on top.\r\n<blockquote><i>She remembered the day she had realized that [Objectivist] economics were not large enough. Their stress on individual excellence left out too many phenomena, too many people: those who had no excellence and never would. The beggars, who nonetheless had definite if obscure roles to play in the way the world ran. They were like parasites on a mammal that torment it to a scratching frenzy that draws blood, but whose eggs serve as food for other insects that feed yet others who fatten the birds that are prey for the rodents the tormented mammal eats. A bloody ecology of trade, replacing the linear Yagaiist contracts occurring in a vacuum. The ecology was large enough to take Sleepers and Sleepless, producers and beggars, the excellent and the mediocre and the seemingly worthless. And what kept the ecology functioning was the law.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nMiranda and the supers find another, which is that fortune can mock anyone regardless of momentary strength or weakness.\r\n<blockquote><i>Tony, Leisha said silently, there are no permanent beggars in Spain. Or anywhere else. The beggar you give a dollar to today might change the world tomorrow. Or become father to the man who will. Or grandfather, or great-grandfather. There is no stable ecology of trade, as I thought once, when I was very young. There is no stable anything, much less stagnant anything, given enough time. And no nonproductive anything, either. Beggars are only gene lines temporarily between communities.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe hyper-precocious kids are about as off-putting as those in <i>Ender's Game</i>. I wish she had only given the Sleepless more time than the unmodified - not superintelligence and immortality to boot. This would still be enough to create the tension the plot needs, they'd just grow with a lower exponent, maybe taking 150 rather than 40 years.\r\n\r\nEveryone in this book, plus maybe Kress herself, are in serious need of the first lesson of first year economics, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage\">comparative advantage</a>. This says, roughly, that it actually isn't a fatal problem if someone is better than you at every different economic task: they still have limited time, so they can still gain from trading with you (you each produce the thing you're best at making then swap some). This understates the problem with <spoiler>launching your entire city population into space, which is that you've just made transactions costs a thousand times more expensive (Y-energy or no). It would be so hard to make Sanctuary profitable, and yet it's implied to be about the GDP of the entire Decadent 20% Productive USA.</spoiler>\r\n\r\nKress portrays a couple of neglected ideologies. One, which determines just as much of world events as liberalism or socialism, has only the ugly name 'productivism' (or maybe also the misleading name 'workaholism'). Leisha is a classic example. On worrying that her elderly stepmother might be just farting around the house: <blockquote><i>Leisha had felt a palpable relief, like a small pop in her chest, when she saw the terminal and medical journals in Susan’s office.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nOn her relationship trouble: <blockquote><i>“We’re fine, Susan. We work together really well. That’s what really matters, after all.”\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nYou can laugh at someone missing the point of life so much, but you should consider how much of what you value depends on people like this. And, when summarised into the long-term growth rate, how much of the vast potential of the future does. (Ada Palmer covers this exact dynamic, as the romantic \"vocateurs\", people of vocation.) And another ideology neglected in fiction: Leisha is a rare instance of \"<a href=\"https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/\">bleeding-heart libertarianism</a>\" (another ugly name).\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n* Kress:<blockquote><i>Genetic engineering is becoming a reality, one that many people are not ready to acknowledge, let alone allow. But you cannot put the genie back in the bottle. We know how to manipulate the human genome and so, inevitably, we will. The two sequels to </i>Beggars in Spain, Beggars and Choosers and Beggars Ride<i>, explore that issue in as much detail as I could invent. Even so, I didn’t come close to covering the excitement, the changes, the shock, and the controversy that genetic engineering will bring in the coming decades. I just wish that I could stick around for a hundred years or so to see it—and to write about it.\r\n</blockquote></i> Nah mate not a hundred years; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00001-y\">try thirty</a>.\r\n\r\n* There are eventually 4 classes: Livers (the idle cosseted underclass), Donkeys (the unmodified workers, the elite Sleepers), Norm Sleepless and the Super Sleepless. <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society\">Ordered pair of ordered pairs</a>.\r\n\r\n* One key to the conflicts is that people have grown used to certain ancient inequalities of degree, but new or qualitative ones should awake all of our envy and rage <blockquote><i>Beautiful or brainy children might encounter natural envy, but usually not virulent hatred. They were not viewed as a different race, one endlessly conspiring at power, endlessly controlling behind the scenes, endlessly feared and scorned. The Sleepless,\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* Most of the big interventions in the book fail. Yagai's gift to the US enables its slide into total indolence and short-termist hedonism. Hawke's nasty uprising for dignified labour morphs into shallow hedonistic <i>Idiocracy</i>, voting for more party money instead of doing things.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Sanctuary is grandly sick, a monarchy masquerading as half a democracy. (It is not quite as sick and complete as the totalitarianism in Vinge's <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>.) <spoiler>The mad monarch, Jennifer is a blank evil cipher for almost the whole book, eventually cracking during the final confrontation. <blockquote><i>This… child, this girl who had never been spat upon because she was Sleepless… never locked in a room by a mother who was putrid with jealousy of a beauty her daughter would never lose, even as the mother’s beauty was inexorably fading… never locked in a cell away from her children… never betrayed by a husband who hated his own sleeplessness… this spoiled and pampered child who had been given everything was attempting to thwart her, Jennifer Sharifi, who had brought Sanctuary into its very being by the force of her own will.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>The children looked at their shoes. They were afraid of her, Jennifer saw. That was not bad; fear was only the ancient word for respect.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nShe's a paranoid idiot, or rather mindkilled by fear and the dread ruthlessness of a survivor. Witness her adhoc patching of the edge cases of personhood on Sanctuary, her silly fixation on mere sleep and mere relative productivity, which is her downfall. And: What good outcome <i>could</i> there have been from her bioterrorist secession? She's an effective villain despite her inertness because she's so good at manipulating smart well-meaning people into vice. The horror of sophistry.\r\n<blockquote><i>She has a right to her life, whatever it is now!”\r\nJennifer said, “The real question is, do we have the right to sacrifice someone else’s life to the care of hers?”</blockquote></i>\r\n</spoiler> \r\n\r\n\r\n* Libertarianism could be a lovely thing, for some other species. It builds a philosophy of life from a completely different direction than mine: top-down, from grand general ideas to morals and behaviour. (Has anyone teased them for having a top-down philosophy which demands the abolition of top-down forces?) The bottom-up approach, missing from this book, is to instead move from experiences, which motivate morals and nonmorals just by you understanding what it is like to experience them. Any subject of experience deserves good; the legal and political implications are distantly contingent on this, and vary massively from time to time as a result. Productivity is good when it leads to good lives: the enlightened definition of 'productive' is whatever does this. If pushpin or cartoons give you pleasure, they're productive. It just happens that there is generally currently millions of times more productive things to do. (The Livers are aesthetically repugnant to me, but eh their lives are better than most.) This isn't as vacuous as it sounds: consider the remarkable goodness of (most of) Jeremy Bentham's beliefs, in a time of universal bigotry. We got better, but we're still not optimising for good vibes.\r\n\r\n* \"Community\" is mostly malign here: the zero-sum nativism of We-Sleep, the incoherent defensive supremacism of Sanctuary. The idea does have a black heart: \"<i>us, not them</i>\", but there are better, nicer examples. (I suppose the Supers are the steelman.) The one grace of the instances here is separatism: they don't initially demand mutilation or submission, just space for their difference. We-Sleep is also a pretty weak exemplar for socialism.\r\n<blockquote><i>“Wake up, Jordan. No social movement has ever progressed without emphasizing division, and doing that means stirring up hate. The American revolution, abolitionism, unionization, civil rights—”\r\n“That wasn’t—”\r\n“At least we didn’t invent this particular division—the Sleepless did. Feminism, gay rights, Dole franchisement—”</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n\r\n* The depiction of the supers' thought process is good and novel - they build and collaborate on \"strings\", complicated visual <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_framework\">argumentation models</a>, replacing natural language.\r\n\r\n* What is Kress' view? It's not that good a question, given that she's trying to do dialectic between ideologies, and does it pretty well. But if we let Leisha's mature view stand in, there are some authorial-sounding notes \r\n<blockquote><i>And throughout it all, the United States: rich, prosperous, myopic, magnificent in aggregate and petty in specifics, unwilling — always, always — to accord mass respect to the mind. To good fortune, to luck, to rugged individualism, to faith in God, to patriotism, to beauty, to spunk or pluck or grit or git, but never to complex intelligence and complex thought. It wasn’t sleeplessness that had caused all the rioting; it was thought and its twin consequences, change and challenge.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nLeisha settles on the idea that it is impossible to reconcile solidarity and high-variance freedom, that the attempt to reconcile them drove Jennifer and the US mad. <blockquote><i>When individuals are free to become anything at all, some will become geniuses and some will become resentful beggars. Some will benefit themselves and their communities, and others will benefit no one and just loot whatever they can. Equality disappears. You can’t have both equality and the freedom to pursue individual excellence.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe book's answer is to not take either horn, to just juggle the contradiction forever. I don't see the dilemma really; you just separate moral worth from ability, then automate the economy: boom, equality and freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMaybe five stars on re-read, though the prose might be a bit flat for that (aside from a couple of moving passages, all quoted above) and maybe the dialectic is too heavy-handed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<i>How does it do as Serious science fiction?</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Social development</i>: Strong. The various caste systems that spring up are believable - for instance the Liver/Donkey one, where the donkeys downplay their own work and set up society as a circus, to short-circuit the questions of employment, dignity, status, revolution. Her nativists are very plausible, though they speak less about \"natural life\" than I expect ours to (the Sleepers seem happy with any genetic modification besides sleeplessness). The elitism of the Sleepless is just a stronger form of the sort already held by certain merely slightly more productive conservatives. Much of the economics is questionable though, particularly the C21st self-sufficient space city of 80,000(?).\r\n\r\n<i>Software development</i>: Good, though high-level even by fiction's standards. The plot hangs on software (including patent databases), though these are mostly reduced to relative hacking ability. Only Vinge is better.\r\n\r\n<i>Actual Science</i>: Some very sketchy genetics at the heart of the plot but not much. It's not pure magic - she puts realistically heavy limits on the genetic engineering of adults - but the rest is just assumed.",

    "review": "Gopnik is one of the best writers alive, in the limited sense that his prose is unerring and musical, that he can make any subject interesting for twenty minutes. But this book, about being young, poor, and dizzily romantic in 80s New York, is too thin, 90% style. I don't resent reading about him and his wife hanging around department stores, nor even the long passage praising his wife, but I also don't take away anything beyond the mouthfeel of his words.\n\nIn some sense their impractical romanticism - spending their last savings on one fancy suit, appreciating graffiti, lingering around Bloomingdale's not buying anything - was straightforwardly aspirational and material. Not bohemian, or, temporarily, on the way up, merely waiting to become an aesthete and, glory of glories, a tastemaker. This is the great tension of arty people, particularly if (as the Gopniks do not) you have pretensions to moral superiority: really you are rejecting one consumerism for another. Book people get away with this most, because the sensuality and pleasure of great writing is hidden between the covers. One solution is to get into high-status trash (you can't be accused of narrow sensualism for liking Tracey Emin or Billy Childish); far more common is to contort yourself so that liking and buying art <i>is</i> a moral action, if not a cleaner and more beautifully non-instrumental kind of moral action than merely doing something for someone.\n<blockquote><i>\nIt’s human nature to turn a mouth taste into a moral taste—to make a question of how something feels in your mouth into a question of what it says about your world. That’s the basis of every dietary law. When we imagine God, we don’t imagine him indifferent to appetite. No, we imagine him enraged and enraptured by what we’re eating—he tastes bacon and declares it bad and tastes matzo and can hear a whole heroic history when he breaks it. Every mouth taste instantly becomes a moral taste. And so when we need to fight—and no marriage can survive without some useful friction—we fight about food...\n\nThe restaurants of New York enraptured me—we didn’t go to any, but I loved the idea of them. I would lie in bed, after we unrolled and enwrapped the “triple fold” sofa every night, and read what was then the premier guide to New York dining out, Seymour Britchky’s <i>The Restaurants of New York</i>... It’s a vanished tone now, in the age of mass amateur reviews on Open Spoon or Table Talk or whatever the current forum is called. (“I took my honey here for birthday dinner, and—wow!—what a blowout. Five stars, for sure.”)\n\nAt the time, though, his criticism... seemed thrilling in the power of its sneering, the certitude of its exclusions. The power critic of this kind depends on the lightning turns of his contempt and his favour: no one should ever be sure where he would land, or on whom.\n</blockquote></i>\n\nNote the smooth way in which a cool irreverent idea - \"<i>It’s human nature to turn a mouth taste into a moral taste</i>\" - becomes a certain precept \"<i>Every mouth taste instantly becomes a moral taste</i>\" just by lightness and repetition. This is the downside of being this good at prose: you can make things sound simpler than they are.\n\nThe humour is ever-present but vanishingly slight. When he loses his only pair of suit trousers, he devotes five pages to a comic lament for them. But it's the echo of comedy.\n<blockquote><i>\nI've never recovered them. Because the truth is that what we learn in New York is that a piece of plywood will never protect you from the wild, and that and that suit trousers, once lost, are lost forever. The city makes you the opposite of the emperor with the new clothes. He walked around unclothed, and everyone noticed but him. In New York, you walk around naked from the waist down for decades, and nobody knows but you.\n</blockquote></i>\n\nThere are still three or four wonderful points, the best of the <i>New Yorker</i>'s shallow profundity\n<blockquote><i>\nThe idea of the cash machine, which now seems either self-evident or dated, seemed exciting then. Cautiously withdrawing thirty-five dollars at a time from our tiny fund, and doing it first at the Chase machine on Third Avenue but soon at cash machines all over town... we came into a different daily relation to money than our parents had done. My grandparents had belonged to a check-cashing generation, proud to be engaged in it. To have an institution as large as an American bank in effect endorse their signature on a little bit of paper as equivalent to money meant to be taken seriously as a citizen. My parents, in turn, were credit card cultists – they loved having them, signing them, showing them, using them. For those who came of age in the boom times after the Second World War, the whole notion of credit, of sharing in a limitless improving future – of being trusted to buy now and pay later, since later would be so much richer than now – had some of the same significance that the notion of being trusted with checks had for my grandparents.\n\nWe, in turn, generationally, had regressed, I realized back into a cash economy – we used checks just to pay the utilities. The machines were one more instrument of that infantilization; we went to the machines for something that felt, at least, like our allowance.\n</blockquote></i>\n\n",

    "review": "The last twenty years see James taking a turn from light entertainment to the history of totalitarianism. He then brings it into everything, <i>everything</i> else, dragging Hitler and Stalin around like the stations of the cross. \r\n\r\nHis <a href=\"http://www.clivejames.com/evenaswespeak/hitler\">long excoriation of Daniel Goldhagen</a> is angry, entertaining, and an education in itself. (The question the two men are at odds over is, “How could civilised, literate, assimilative Germany Do Such Things?” Goldhagen says: 'because they – all Germans – were eliminationists just itching for an excuse'. James’ answer instead puts due weight on the simplest explanation: 'they did it because a single word of dissent meant death, for any of them'.) \r\n\r\nJames is a bit obsessed by his chosen field – Hitler references turn up in his sunny, giddy Sydney Olympics pieces! Then there’s an ornately maudlin account of his acquaintance with Diana Spenser. (I spent a little while trying to pigeonhole his politics recently – this non-republican, anti-Marxist, pro-American-culture hobnobber – and decided it is wrong to call him right-wing. “<i>Democracy is really valuable only for what it prevents…</i>”) \r\n\r\nFunny, profound in places, but his late themes had solidified already and are covered better in <i>A Point of View</i> and <i>Cultural Amnesia</i>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li>    <a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Galef type</a>: \r\n<b>Data 3</b> - highlights patterns in the world\r\n<b>Values 1</b> - an explicit argument about values .\r\n\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",

If we are always caught between risk and resignation, between confidence and catastrophe, how can we decide what to do next?</i>\"<p style=\"line-height: 5px\">&#8212; Adam Phillips</p>\r\n\r\n<i>My problem is what my mother kept telling me: I'm too messianic in my views.</i><p style=\"line-height: 5px\">\r\n&#8212; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/28/businessandfinance.philosophy\">Taleb</a></p></div></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe most ambitious and messy book in his idiosyncratic four-volume work of evolutionary epistemology, the '<i>Incerto</i>'. (It is <i><a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2014/04/20/fooled-randomness/\">Fooled By Randomness</a></i>, <i><a href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2007/04/09/nassim_talebs_t/\">Black Swan</a></i>, <i><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/dec/21/bed-of-procrustes-digested-read\">Bed of Procrustes</a></i>, and yonder.) The former three books are largely critical, hacking away at theory-blindness, model error, and the many kinds of people he sees as possessing unearned status (economists, journalists, consultants, business-book writers): this is the upswing, a chaotic attempt to give general positive advice in a world that dooms general positive advice.\r\n\r\nEvery other page has something worth hearing, for its iconoclasm, or a Latin gobbet, or catty anecdote, if not something globally and evidently true. I think he is right about 30% of the time, which is among the highest credences I have for anyone. I only think I am 35% right, for instance.* But a core point of his system is that his approach should work even given our huge and partially intractable ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe core point, repeated a hundred times for various domains: \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>In real life, many systems deteriorate without an irregular supply of \r\nstressors (non-fatal negative events), and actually benefit from them by constructively overreacting. By robbing such 'antifragile' systems of stressors, modern approaches to managing \r\nthem do damage in the guise of helping out.**</i></blockquote>\r\nThis observation leads to his grand theory of everything: every system is either <i>fragile</i> (damaged by volatility), <i>robust</i> (resistant to damage from volatility), or <i>antifragile</i>. This isn't a trivial distinction, because each has formal properties that allow us to change arrangements to, firstly, prevent explosions, and then to gain from chance volatility. \r\n\r\nBiology is definitely one of these antifragile systems***; his case that, absent gross financialisation, the global economy would be one is convincing too; and the idea's at least plausible when applied to the cultivation of virtue or existential strength in a single person. The danger with this - an indissoluble danger because there can be no general strategy to avoid it - is that in welcoming <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress\">constructive stress</a> we'll miss the point at which the welcomed dose turns destructive (where fasting starts to atrophy, where training becomes masochism, where critique becomes pogrom, where sink-or-swim encouragement turns abuse). \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n* This claim is remarkable for both its extreme vagueness and apparent arrogance. Here is a post to handle the former fact. And the latter:\r\n\r\nIt might strike you as beyond arrogant to assume that you <i>just so happen</i> to be the most reliable inference device in the world, but that doesn't (have to) follow from my claim above, which results from the trivial thought &#8220;I believe my own beliefs most&#8221;, instead.\r\n\r\n(Consider the converse: if I came to view anyone as more reliable than me, the rational thing to do would be to incorporate their truer views (and, better, their methods) until I again thought of myself as at least their equal. So, either one believes the superficially arrogant position &#8220;I believe my beliefs most&#8221; &#8211; or else one must believe that one is incapable of adapting enough to superior methods when faced with them, or else one must believe that one cannot know which methods are best. So the above assumption is more about having a high opinion of rational <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/3nn/scientific_selfhelp_the_state_of_our_knowledge/\">adjustment</a> than impossible egotism, I think. \r\n\r\nGood news! We can now calibrate ourselves, at least for the most sensational and available predictions using <a href=\"http://predictionbook.com/\">this cool thing</a>.^\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally!: The fully-unpacked, properly defensible assumption might be something more like: &#8220;I am the agent that I know to be most transparently reliable or unreliable; I assume I&#8217;m adjusting properly to better methods; as such I have at least equal confidence in my own belief set, compared to the best known alternative agent's.&#8221;)\r\n\r\n<blockquote>^ You might wonder if this argument suggests that I should have 100% confidence in my beliefs. No; even if I was the best inferrer, I would suffer uncertainty because of the opacity of my errors: that is, I know I'm often not right but don't know exactly whereabouts I'm not right. Also from the unsystematic internal PredictionBook every non-psychopath has (\"<i>wisdom is knowing you'll be an idiot in the future</i>\"). And another source of uncertainty is down to the unknowable (like what stocks will crash next week).\r\n\r\nI do worry that, whatever my particular self-credence estimate is, the whole approach is subtly wrong somewhere &#8211; since \"40%\" gives the impression that I think of myself as a worse guide to the world than dumb chance^^ &#8211; but I think it works. Particularly if much of the missing 60% is made of safe scepticism rather than errors.\r\n\r\n^^ For binary event spaces &#8211; but, really, how many of those are there in real life?\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n** He credits the formal basis of all this to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality\">Jensen's inequality</a>, in a chapter which might be the clearest expression of the idea there is.\r\n\r\n*** (In particular species-level evolution, but also organism-level health.) \r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n*************************************************************&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\nSome pigeonholes you might think to put all this in:\r\n\r\n<ul>* <li><i>Conservative?</i> Yes; but a good-hearted Burkean (<i>&#8220;Antifragility implies that the old is superior to the new&#8230; What survives must be good at serving some purpose that time can see but our eyes and logical faculties can&#8217;t capture&#8230;&#8221;</i>). Most people are conservative over <i>some</i> things (e.g. the natural world; we just happen to call that conservationism instead). Also approves of any high technology that removes anything he views as a disease of civilisation, like <a href=\"http://regressing.deadspin.com/the-scientific-case-against-vibrams-fivefinger-running-1575132888\">these things</a> were supposed to be. So, in general, conservative only in the sense that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk\">existential risk</a> people are.*</li>\r\n\r\n* <li><i>Economic conservatism</i>. Only sort of; he's a trader, and would have speculation free to flow <i>provided that deposit banks were nationalised first</i>, and prioritises deficit reduction in a way we associate with conservatives but which e.g. <a href=\"http://www.voxeu.org/article/fiscal-consolidation-sweden-role-model\">Sweden pulled off</a> without any lasting social justice sting. More formally he is against centralisation on both moral and technical grounds; that is <i>likely</i> a principle with some conservative effects, justified, in theory, by its keeping us alive. (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-critical_system\">Life-critical</a> politics.)</li>\r\n<li><i>Laissez faire?</i> No: he recommends radical change to e.g. science funding, but no decrease. Big fan of Switzerland&#8217;s government, read into that what you will. He sees &#8220;optionality&#8221;, an originally financial concept, as the solution to fragility risks and the key to success in every domain there is. This isn&#8217;t at all as economistic as it sounds; the sacred and the humane somehow fit perfectly into his core rationalist agenda, persistence through change.</li>\r\n\r\n* <li><i>Social conservatism?</i> No sign; no discussion of discrimination. Some people think such abstention is oppressive, but they are probably wrong.</li>\r\n* <li><i>Social Darwinist?</i> Nah.</li>\r\n* <li><i>Bioconservative?</i> Absolutely; he describes himself as the &#8216;diametric&#8217; opposite of <a href=\"http://www.inquisitr.com/1000017/google-exec-ray-kurzweil-takes-150-vitamin-supplements-every-day/\">Ray Kurzweil</a>, and he&#8217;s in full uproar over the global risk posed by synthetic biology (and recently fleshed out this horror <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8nhAlfIk3QIbGFzOXF5UUN3N2c/edit?pli=1\">in highly rigorous terms</a>).</li>\r\n* <li><i>Anti-intellectual?</i> Not at all! Only anti-academia, and they still do not represent the whole of quality intellectual life. Hates irresponsible &#8216;canned methods of inference&#8217; too (statistical significance, etc).</li>\r\n* <li><i>Lacrimist?</i> (That is, does he glorify suffering?) Not quite. He certainly views comfort as vitiating. His opposition to transhumanism is too quick and doesn't take the moral challenge of a world of pained beings seriously enough, for me.</li>\r\n* <li><i>Macho?</i> Hm. Well, nature <i>has</i> made certain challenging actions optimal. Amusing proto-paleo attitude, too: \r\n* <blockquote><i>I, for my part, resist eating fruits not found in the ancient Eastern Mediterranean (I use &#8220;I&#8221; here in order to show that I am not narrowly generalizing to the rest of humanity). I avoid any fruit that does not have an ancient Greek or Hebrew name, such as mangoes, papayas, even oranges. Oranges seem to be the postmedieval equivalent of candy; they did not exist in the ancient Mediterranean.</i></blockquote></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n* His work fits the x-risk paradigm very well, but he developed his edifice in complete isolation from them, and has an uncompromising scepticism about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\">expected value</a> that might not make cross-overs all that fruitful.\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n*************************************************************&nbsp;</div>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/02/antifragile-nassim-nicholas-taleb-review\">How original is the core point, really</a>?\r\n\r\nWell, who cares? His claim is that he had to invent the word 'antifragile', not the idea. He says, idiosyncratically, that Seneca and Nietzsche had the nub of the idea, and Jensen the formal essence; Darwin certainly did too. \"<a href=\"http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754646419\">Resilience engineering</a>\" and in computing, '<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming\">defensive programming</a>' (b. 1998) and '<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_computing\">self-healing systems</a>' (b. 2001) are at least on the same track, though not getting beyond a lively sort of robustness. But I doubt that most systems can become antifragile - e.g. it's hard to imagine an antifragile jet engine (one that harvests <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_strike\">bird strikes</a> for fuel, or soot cleaning)? So maybe it's only the grand generalisation to all design that's new.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n*************************************************************&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\nGripes: His footnotes are collected by theme rather than linked to his claims directly, which makes it so difficult to follow up his sources that his credibility suffers. He namedrops, which is not the same as showing his working. I would really like to see his backing for his cool claims (about e.g. an irregular sleep pattern as a good thing, or things like &#8216;I suspect that thermal comfort ages people&#8217;), but it&#8217;s hidden away and <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/\">often one-study</a>. (Again: <i>apparently</i> one-study, since his working is not easily on show.)\r\n\r\nHe has a surprisingly high opinion of Steve Jobs &#8211; who I view as a grand example of an <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/empty-suit.asp\">empty suit</a>: there are 9 references to Jobs&#8217; hokey shark-wisdom, (where Gigerenzer and Mandelbrot get 8, Jensen gets 7, Marx 7). Does Jobs really count as a &#8216;practitioner&#8217; with &#8216;skin in the game&#8217;? Eh.\r\n\r\nHis homebrew jargon starts to drag &#8211; some sentences are wholly composed of <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/483/\">his neologisms</a> plus a barrel of articles and prepositions. (I used the glossary early and often.) Repetitive: tells what he&#8217;ll tell you, tells you he&#8217;s told you. Some passages really suffer from his wholesale hostility to copy-editing; there are some flatly bad sentences here. And he namedrops a lot, more than fair attribution of ideas &#8211; there are several passages that are just lists of people he likes (e.g. p.257-8). \r\n\r\nI don't see that it's worthwhile to criticise his arrogant style; it's what animates his points, and he never uses it on weak targets.\r\n\r\nLastly, he sometimes makes of a system&#8217;s persistence the highest good. (Where its persistence is to be contrasted with mere stability.) This is in tension with his wonderful emphasis on artistic and quasi-sacred values elsewhere in the book.\r\n\r\nBut it talks about everything, is historically wide-eyed, relentlessly rational, and often funny. And the method-worldview-style it suggests might stop life crushing us utterly.",

If, as the scientists <a href=\"fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf\">strongly agree we should</a>, we take this seriously, then poverty alleviation might not be good at all! <i>But then</i>, consider that wild animals also suffer, millions of times more of them than even factory farmed animals, and that human industrialisation <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/humanitys-net-impact-on-wild-animal-suffering/\">plausibly decreases</a> this by removing habitat (...) )<br><br>\r\n\r\nMeta-contrarianism is vital is because philosophy, politics and economics are littered with crucial consideration landmines like these, single premises that can fully transform our conception of good action. \r\n\r\nOur problem is not socialism or theism or atheism or conservativism: the problem is irrational, reflexive views with no connection to the balance of evidence: i.e. ideologies and not philosophies. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAnyway: I was pretty good-hearted, but neither clear nor honest. An ideologue. McCloskey, a Christian libertarian(!) and much else besides, got to <i>even me</i> via our shared contempt for neoclassical macroeconomics and null-hypothesis significance testing, two things she critiqued twenty years before the Great Recession and the replication crisis.\r\n\r\nThen she shocked me with the meta-contrary title of this, the first volume in her epic economic history of moral development: a reclamation of a slur on the creators of this good modern world we all increasingly enjoy. \r\n\r\nI don't know how many iterations of contrarianism (\"dialectic\") I'm on; it's not important, as long as I hold my views lightly enough to do one more when the evidence demands it.\r\n\r\nBesides long meditations on the pagan and Christian virtues, she holds a serious discussion on <i>Groundhog Day</i>, Thomas Mann, and much other art, and is the best telling of the maligned, vital <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution#Standards_of_living\">Great Transformation</a> story. Triumphant and funny and trembling with erudition.\r\n\r\n\r\n* At the time I thought being an atheist was <i>really</i> contrarian, but in Britain it really isn't. (Outside an RME classroom.) <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-people-atheist-no-religion-uk-christianity-islam-sikism-judaism-jewish-muslims-a7928896.html\">The formal stats</a> are only now showing a majority for <i>stated</i> nonbelief, but church attendance has been a minority practice since the early C20th.\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li>\r\n <i><a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Galef type</a></i>:\r\n <b>Data 3</b> - highlight patterns in the world, &\r\n <b>Theory 2</b> - models of what makes something succeed or fail , &\r\n <b>Values 1</b> -  an explicit argument about values,  &\r\n <b>Style 2</b> - learn a style of thinking by studying the author’s approach to the world.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",

    "review": "I love James because, though he is a literary intellectual through and through, he makes room for the other half of the human mind. He <i>is</i> still an arts supremacist - this personal portrait of the century contains no scientists, and many actors and novelists and politicians, but he is at least aware of the narrowness of this.\n\n<i>Cultural Amnesia</i> is an invitation to the humanities; defence of philosophy and art against politics; an attack on the hypocrisy of the left (Kollontai, Sartre, Brecht, Saramago), on the heartlessness of the right (Junger, Brasillach, Pound, Heidegger); a dark, teeming biography of C20th humanism and its enemies; a reading list for all of us bewildered by the bullshit critical fortresses of serious writing about art and history. James is deeply opinionated, often funny and occasionally heartbreaking.\n\nOf “the relationship between Hitler’s campaign on the eastern front and Richard Burton’s pageboy haircut”. It’s full of faded and non-Anglophone stars (Egon Friedell, Arthur Schnitzler, Marcel Reich-Ranicki, Paz, Urena), villains (Brassilach, Celine, Pound, Sartre, Brecht), pop-defining celebrities (Beatrix Potter, Dick Cavett, Michael Mann) and sad outrage. \n\nIt’s also or really an autobiography, a list of the people and one-liners that struck James as he travelled the century. WW2 and the Soviet Empire dominate as the most deadly instances of the theme “how politics invaded art and came close to killing it”. \n\nOther themes: irrational violence, the nonconformist left, collaborators and fellow-travellers, Jewish achievements, the failure of totalitarian simplicity, ‘the American century’, rise and fall of jazz. He falls for clash-of-civilisation talk a bit, but he’s never conservative without a reason. I think what I love about him is that he stands up for boring truths – ‘<i>it takes another power to keep a power in check’, “the law’s imperfections are tokens of its necessity</i>” etc. \n\nFor every villain we are given a counter exemplar: Marc Bloch, Sophie Scholl, Jorge Borges...  \n\nThis is my second read-through in five years; I expect to read it again in another five. \n",

It hurts to read for some reason – he’s never miserable, and rarely handles even abstract tragedy explicitly, but I get tight behind my eyes. ",

For instance: some two-thirds of the world is deficient in vitamin D; few people get enough magnesium through their food; and it’s uncontroversial that vegans should supplement B12. But we’re not really in conflict, because he’d change his mind if he looked at the evidence, and we each accept that (publically-funded) science will out the truth. \n\nProse <b>2/5,</b> ideas <b>4/5.</b> \n\n(I read this under an edition called <i>Killing Us Softly</i>.)",

To be fair the second half’s travel pieces spend exactly that: from being right inamidst hallucinatory police brutality in Haiti, to the Africa pieces which buck stereotypes and complacency. He has vast sensitivity or sensibility, but he pairs it with a kind of generalisation (e.g. “<i>begging is a consequence of opportunity, not poverty</i>”) and off-piste counter-PC phrasemaking, as if to shock us out of respecting him.\n\nHe uses his friend Jeremy Clarkson brilliantly – as stooge, dim counterpoint to Gill’s own professed post-masculine, pro-gay, pro-grey, pro-oppressed enlightenment. But then Gill reports all these uber-macho exploits and self-conscious leering at women. What compels him to be so <i>indirect</i> about being progressive?

He’s well-versed in the philosophy (he cites Rorty!), is a master of fear (research), and I feel smarter coming out of it. ",

Beautiful 60s farce, mocking the zany side while accepting the force of the hippy challenge to all sorts of things, lastingly sexism. The jokes rely heavily on the difference in vitality and affluence between 60s Britain and California – one grey and without central heating, the other soaked in optimism, sex and cute subversions. <b>\n 4/5.</b><br>\n </li>\n <li>\n <b><i>Small World</i></b> (1984). Even better, more romantic and full of risky narrative moves – regular cinematic cuts, 40 characters in two dozen Richard-Curtis conjunctions, a character commenting on his narrative role, a cod-Japanese passage without articles... Generous and barbed and fun. <b>4*/5.</b><br><br>\n </li>\n <li>\n <b><i>Nice Work</i></b> (1988). I suppose what I like most about Lodge is his marriage of (and subversion of) highfalutin Theory with daft romcom conventions. This last one’s grimmer – based more on the mutual misunderstanding and vices of literary theory and industry. Thatcher’s jaws lurk in the background. Also race. Robyn, his feminist protagonist is good and 3D, principled and struggling with the contradictions of the radical academic (their privileged position in a system they abhor, ‘revolutionary’ abstractions, the attack on logocentric realism leading to detachment from lived life where things happen). Robyn’s attitude to love inspired <a href=\"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7w0eqUBp3c\">this great satire</a>. <br><b>\n 4/5</b><br><br>\n </li>\n</ul>",

On the other hand, he’s careful to list PC’s achievements, and official figures underlie some of his arguments. I wasn't skilled enough to judge when I read this.\n\nLike everyone, he tries to claim the rational high ground over his enemies, but the connection between identity politics and postmodern irrationality is nowhere near the tight causation he claims. He seems to be genuinely hurt by the reaction to his argument.\n\nReality is fucked up; if we can’t even <i>test</i> any hypothesis which offends anyone, then we are doomed to delusion and early death.

    "review": "Exciting and well-written but unreliable and unfocussed. The main thesis is that debt isn't straightforward accounting: all systems of debt require a hidden moral assumption, which is that it's bad to be indebted, that debt overrules other moral claims like equity or even survival:\r\n<blockquote><i>paying one’s debts is not the essence of morality, that all these things are human arrangements and that if democracy is to mean anything, it is the ability to all agree to arrange things in a different way.</blockquote></i>\r\nTo establish this he goes into an array of human economies: slaving, gift economies, Kula rings... but the brute fact of diverse institutions doesn't really connect with his moral thesis. <i>Then</i> this all goes towards his grand equating of the market and the state (so that people will resist both of them). \r\n\r\nHe argues that formal debt (of accountants and lawyers) causes poverty and violence relative to traditional informal debt (of cousins, dowries, and sheep). But this is wildly inconsistent with the last two hundred years of social development; poverty is a fraction of what it was, and violence (including state violence, including incarceration as violence) is also down.\r\n\r\nHe gets worked up about \"the myth of barter\", the largely silly idea that there was generally a transition from pure barter economies to money economies at some point in cultural history. Even if we grant this, his estimation of the significance of barter being rare is excessive. It doesn't have any clear moral bearing.\r\n\r\nHis debt Jubilee idea, coming as it did post-Recession, is superficially good, especially since giant financiers had just received trillions in bailouts. But if we made debt forgiveness a common concern, we'd just be redistributing money to those best at obtaining credit via excessive self-esteem, credentials or scamming. And post-Jubilee credit system would immediately dry up, or sting us with vast interest rates. They couldn't exist otherwise, and then homeowning and car purchase would again be only within reach for the rich.\r\n\r\nThere are dozens or more or less serious errors in it. (Still less unreliable than most anarchism and most cultural anthropology.) If you still want to read it, you really should take note of the huge errata others have helpfully contributed to Graeber, not that he'd thank them:\r\n\r\n- <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2012/02/22/the-world-economy-is-not-a-tribute-system/\">Henry Farrell</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.annleckie.com/2013/02/24/debt/\">Ann Leckie</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2014/11/book-review-debt-first-5000-years.html\">Noah Smith</a>\r\n- <a href=\"https://codeandculture.wordpress.com/2011/12/29/how-the-poor-debtors/\">Gabriel Rossman</a>\r\n- <a href=\"http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2014/11/monday-smackdown-in-the-absence-of-high-quality-delong-smackdowns-back-to-david-graeber.html\">Brad deLong</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is 4/5 for style and ambition, provided you don't take any particular claim too seriously.

The warmth of his teaching voice comes through the page:\n<blockquote><i>\nAs you read the book, feel free to skim or skip any parts you find troublesome; it’s the big picture that matters, and you’ll probably get more out of those parts if you revisit them after the puzzle is assembled.\n</i></blockquote>\nbut he needs a better editor, more even than Nassim Taleb does. This is often just a stream-of-consciousness analogy-dump, and with precise topics that just doesn't fly. (Both Penguin productions.) \n\nThere's more wrong with it than prose, unfortunately: he gives equal time to unpromising approaches (genetic programming, analogical reasoning) and so has to skim over the single most important approach (deep learning), with no real sense of the giant differences in success. Couple this with his terrible argument against AI risk (\"<i>unlike humans, computers don’t have a will of their own. They’re products of engineering, not evolution... the evaluation function is determined by us. A more powerful computer will just optimize it better... The same reasoning applies to all AI systems because they all—explicitly or implicitly—have the same three components. They can vary what they do, even come up with surprising plans, but only in service of the goals we set them.</i>\") and it becomes actively unhelpful.\n\n(Pedantic aside: he commits linguistic violence every time he uses \"algorithm\" instead of the unsexy true referent, \"<i>program</i>\". He obviously knows the distinction much better than I do, but skips this to talk down / excitingly to the audience.)\n\nRead <a href=\"https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf\">his great dense paper</a> instead.\n\nDNF 50%",

    "review": "<i>KD</i> is fun and uncliched but quite didactic. Its irreverence is not mostly directed at Kafka, despite the aggressive-seeming title. \n\n<i>IM</i> relies heavily on lighting, juxtaposition, and Daniel Day-Lewis' tics. Either play is much more likely to endear Kafka to you than his own books, or any of the absurd battery of critical texts on him. \n\nThis is my favourite thing on Kafka:\n\n<blockquote><i>There are many perils in writing about Kafka. His work has been garrisoned by armies of critics with some fifteen thousand books about him at the last count. As there is a Fortress Freud so is there a Fortress Kafka, Kafka his own castle. For admission a certain high seriousness must be deemed essential and I am not sure I have it. One is nervous about presuming even to write his name, wanting to beg pardon for doing so, if only because Kafka was so reluctant to write his name himself. Like the Hebrew name of God, it is a name that should not be spoken, particularly by an Englishman. In his dreams Kafka once met an Englishman. He was in a good grey flannel suit, the flannel also covering his face... The Channel is a slipper bath of irony through which we pass these serious Continentals in order not to be infected by their gloom. This propensity I am sure I have not escaped or tried to: but then there is something that is English about Kafka, and it is not only his self-deprecation. A vegetarian and fond of the sun, he seems a familiar crank; if he’d been living in England at the turn of the century, and not in Prague, one can imagine him going out hiking and spending evenings with like-minded friends in Letchworth...\n\nIn that department [DIY] certainly Kafka did not excel. He was not someone you would ask to help put up a shelf, for instance, though one component of his charm was an exaggerated appreciation of people who could, and of commonplace accomplishments generally. Far from being clumsy himself (he had something of the dancer about him), he would marvel (or profess to marvel) at the ease with which other people managed to negotiate the world. This kind of professed incompetence (‘Silly me!’) often leads to offers of help, and carried to extremes it encourages the formation of unofficial protection societies. Thus Kafka was much cosseted by the ladies in his office and in the same way the pupils of another candidate for secular sainthood, the French philosopher Simone Weil, saw to it that their adored teacher did not suffer the consequences of a practical un-wisdom even more hopeless than Kafka’s.\n\nOne cannot say that Kafka’s marvelling at mundane accomplishments was not genuine, was a ploy. The snag is that when the person doing the marvelling goes on to do great things this can leave those with the commonplace accomplishments feeling a little flat. Say such a person goes on to win the Nobel Prize: it is scant consolation to know that one can change a three-pin plug.\n\nGorky said that in Chekhov’s presence everyone felt a desire to be simpler, more truthful and more oneself. Kafka too had this effect. ‘On his entrance into a room,’ wrote a contemporary, ‘it seemed as though some unseen attendant had whispered to the lecturer: “Be careful about everything you say from now on. Franz Kafka has just arrived.” ’ To have this effect on people is not an unmixed blessing. When we are on our best behaviour we are not always at our best.\n\nThis is not to say that Kafka did not make jokes in life and in art. The Trial, for instance, is a funnier book than it has got credit for and Kafka’s jokes about himself are the better for the desperate circumstances in which they were often made. He never did win the Nobel Prize but contemplated the possibility once in fun and in pain, and in a fairly restricted category (though one he could have shared with several contemporaries, Proust, Katherine Mansfield and D.H. Lawrence among them). When he was dying of TB of the larynx he was fetching up a good deal of phlegm. ‘I think,’ he said (and the joke is more poignant for being so physically painful to make), ‘I think I deserve the Nobel Prize for sputum.’ Nothing if not sick, it is a joke that could have been made yesterday.\n\nDead sixty-odd years, Kafka is still modern and there is much in the present-day world to interest him. These days Kafka would be intrigued by the battery farm and specifically, with an interest both morbid and lively, in the device that de-beaks the still-living chickens; in waste-disposal trucks that chew the rubbish before swallowing it; and those dubious restaurants that install for your dining pleasure a tank of doomed trout. As the maître d’ assists the discerning diner in the ceremony of choice, be aware of the waiter who wields the net: both mourner and executioner, he is Kafka. He notes old people in Zimmer frames stood in their portable dock on perambulatory trial for their lives. He is interested in the feelings of the squash ball and the champagne bottle that launches the ship. In a football match his sympathy is not with either of the teams but with the ball or, in a match ending nil-nil, with the hunger of the goalmouth... he would be concerned with the current debate on the disposal of nuclear waste. To be placed in a lead canister which is then encased in concrete and sunk fathoms deep to the floor of the ocean was the degree of circulation he thought appropriate for most of his writing. Or not, of course...\n\nHad Kafka the father emigrated to America as so many of his contemporaries did, things might have turned out differently for Kafka the son. He was always stage-struck. Happily lugubrious, he might have turned out a stand-up Jewish comic. Kafka at Las Vegas.\n\nWhy didn’t Kafka stutter? The bullying father, the nervous son – life in the Kafka household seems a blueprint for a speech impediment. In a sense, of course, he did stutter. Jerky, extruded with great force and the product of tremendous effort, everything Kafka wrote is a kind of stutter. Stutterers devise elaborate routines to avoid or to ambush and take by surprise troublesome consonants, of which K is one of the most difficult. It’s a good job Kafka didn’t stutter. With two Ks he might have got started on his name and never seen the end of it. As it is, he docks it, curtails it, leaves its end behind much as lizards do when something gets hold of their tail.\n\n...Hermann Kafka has had such a consistently bad press that it’s hard not to feel a sneaking sympathy for him as for all the Parents of Art. They never get it right. They bring up a child badly and he turns out a writer, posterity never forgives them – though without that unfortunate upbringing the writer might never have written a word. They bring up a child well and he never does write a word. Do it right and posterity never hears about the parents: do it wrong and posterity never hears about anything else.\n</i></blockquote>\n\nYou do not necessarily need to read <i>Kafka's Dick</i> after reading that.",

    "review": "Rousing history of one of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll\">worst</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics\">things</a> that has ever happened: the 1918 outbreak of H1N1 flu. It focusses particularly on the great scientists who tried to fight it, none of whom I'd ever heard of. Also a meditation on epistemology, the modern mind, & the redemptive meaning of science for beasts like us.\r\n\r\nBarry senses that the headline result - one-third of the entire world infected, with <b><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875246\">25-100</a></b> million dead - doesn't get enough of a rise from us. The numbers are numbing. So he couches it in modern shocking terms:\r\n<blockquote><i>  It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century.</i></blockquote>\r\nOr ten thousand 9/11s. It's worth belabouring this, because we have a <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133682\">weird habit</a> of paying far more attention to human threats than natural ones, even when natural ones are far worse. (Witness our terrorism prevention budgets compared to our infectious disease control budgets, when the latter is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4024220/\">a thousand times</a> <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/202871/number-of-fatalities-by-terrorist-attacks-worldwide/\">more lethal</a>.)\r\n\r\nSo: The 1918 flu was worse than the entire First World War: 40+ million died of flu compared with 17 million dead from war; 500 million lives damaged by flu vs 41 million lives by war. 3% of everyone alive died of flu, including about 8% of young adults(!).\r\n\r\nExcept it's hard to separate the War and the pandemic. The virus was spread everywhere by unprecedented numbers of troops, and by the massive supply convoys it induced, and by the War's other <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140123-spanish-flu-1918-china-origins-pandemic-science-health/\">human displacements</a>. We don't know how many of the pneumonia deaths only occurred because of the logistical degradation, poverty and pestilence of wartime. There are terrible nonlinearities involved in overcrowding and global movement of troops. But add millions at least to the overall death toll caused by WWI.\r\n\r\nThe book is in the epic mode, all the way through. (That's not a straightforward compliment.) I liked it, but I understand if it's a bit American for you:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nMan might be defined as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts to control nature. In this relationship with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor, and a daring one at that, altering the flow of rivers, building upon geological faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once aroused and occasionally displaying a flair for violence.\r\n\r\nBy 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientific, but too busy fighting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it did not do so prodding languidly. For the first time, modern humanity, a humanity practicing the modern scientific method, would confront nature in its fullest rage.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nThere's a long prelude describing how terrible medicine was up to the 20th Century. Medicine was \"the withered arm of science\". Therapeutic nihilism (that is, \"we can't really do anything\") was the only rational view, replacing millenia of Galenic woo.\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nStengel reviewed dozens of ideas advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s message was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked... Nothing they were doing worked.</i></blockquote>\r\nProblem is, this rational scepticism created a powerful vacuum: humans need to believe something can heal, and the gap was filled with worse. Some confabulated gremlins from this time haunt us still: homeopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, Christian Science, and (though Barry doesn't include them) the organic farming movement and psychoanalysis.\r\n\r\nFew people come off well. Even among the scientists, we get a horrible example of perverse priors and premature updating: an enormous proportion of all scientific resources were devoted to fighting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae\">the wrong pathogen</a>, due to a bad guess by an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Friedrich_Johannes_Pfeiffer\">extremely eminent researcher</a>.\r\n\r\nBecause so much of the state was occupied in war, in places there was wholesale social collapse:\r\n<blockquote><i>In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to avoid the other person’s breathing. \r\n\r\nThe impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. 850 Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospital had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical masks and gowns, eight doctors and fifty-four nurses—43 percent of the staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hospital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession.\r\n\r\nWhen a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them. In every home where someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone was ill in every home...\r\n\r\nStarr went to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qualified nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either fear or exhaustion, did not come again.\r\n\r\nNearly 1/4 of all the patients in his hospital died each day. Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would find that between one-quarter and one-fifth of the patients in the hospital had died, replaced by new ones... Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terrified that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at first, within them moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a will that was taking over their bodies — and could be killing them...\r\nThe city was frozen with fear, frozen into stillness. Starr lived 12 miles from the hospital. The streets were silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of the city had almost stopped.”\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nEveryone can read the collapse of official power in Philadelphia as supporting their politics. Anarchists can point to the benevolent spontaneous order that arose after the corrupt local government failed to act; libertarians can point out that this spontaneous order was all funded by the richest Philadelphians; statists can point out that, without actually-authoritative co-ordination, the effort eventually failed, because people defected against each other, in fear.\r\n<blockquote><i>The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, filling every area of these establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues overflowing into corridors; in the city morgue overflowing into the street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, in corners of the floor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them.\r\n\r\nThe police wore their ghostly surgical masks, and people fled them, but the masks had no effect on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with many more to follow...<br> More coffins came by rail, guarded by men with guns.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"<i>There is, therefore, but one response possible from us: Force! force to the utmost, force without stint or limit, the righteous and triumphant force which shall make right the law of the world and cast every selfish dominion down in the dust. \"</i></blockquote>- Woodrow Wilson addressing one of his money-lending mobs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilson tends to be viewed pretty positively, just because he won. (\"<i>at last the world knows America as the savior of the world</i>!\") But he perverted an entire state and nation to do so, ignored the terrible suffering of his own damn population for years, and refused a conditional peace with Austria in August and <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/germany-telegraphs-president-wilson-seeking-armistice\">with the Kaiser's new parliament</a> in September. (This meant 30-70 extra days of war, which, if this period was as lethal as the rest of the war, means up to <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?dcr=0&q=18000000+%2F+1559+*+70&oq=18000000+%2F+1559+*+70&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1761.1839.0.1945.2.2.0.0.0.0.87.87.1.1.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..2.0.0.UNPLBXOgOHQ\">800,000</a> completely unnecessary deaths, not to mention the continuing waste of resources during the worst epidemic ever). Wilson did great evil, was not much different from the Kaiser, the election aside.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i> the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rapidly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incompetent young ones or those over forty-five years of age, the vast majority of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nBarry's middle chapters are a frightening portrait of how rabidly un-American the US was in 1918. The laws were bad enough - for instance the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Act_of_1918\">ban on criticising the government</a>. But then there's the unofficial \"patriotic duties\", punishable by beatings. State-sponsored atavism.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>By the summer of 1918, however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s attention and intent on the war.\r\n\r\nHe had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of soldiers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions—for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy.\r\n\r\nHe had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, a bond-selling apparatus... He had even succeeded in stifling speech, in the summer of 1918 arresting and imprisoning — some for prison terms longer than ten years —not just radical labor leaders and editors of German-language newspapers but powerful men, even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_L._Berger\">a congressman</a>.\r\n\r\nHe had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any other in the nation’s history. And the final extension of federal power had come only in the spring of 1918, after the first wave of influenza had begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. Only on May 23, 1918, had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his “work or fight” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential industry would be drafted...\r\n\r\nCrowder bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been spending nearly fifty years to perfect...\"\r\n\r\nIn mid-August, as the lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already inquired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would follow. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the first week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wilson formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later — days of battle and deaths — the Austrian note remained unanswered.\r\n\r\nEarlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. He was not now fighting to the death; he was fighting only to kill...\r\n\r\nIf Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The relief effort for influenza victims would find no assistance in the Food Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administration. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources.\r\n\r\n...the military would give no help to civilians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at Devens and called Gorgas’s office, his warning had been relayed to the army chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely necessary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be made... Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or dying, did the army make any adjustments.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nBecause the disease was everywhere, ravaging the entire species (and beyond), the book can't cover everything. Very little is said about non-Americans, i.e about 98% of the death and chaos. This is partly because there just isn't a lot of evidence about them, despite their influenza immunity and medical care being even worse. (This is why the top estimates reach 100m deaths, three times the median estimate.) Here is a passage about just a tiny number of them, in the north:\r\n<blockquote><i>In Alaska, whites protected themselves. Sentries guarded all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for five days. Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross official warned that without “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.”...\r\n\r\nThe navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a relief expedition... They found terrible things. One doctor visited ten tiny villages and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths… Survivors generally children… probably 25% frozen to death before help arrived.”\r\n\r\nThe virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so suddenly it left no one well enough to care for any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have wanted to no longer be alone... Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came, it struck so hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs.  The dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, then wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed... In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n---\r\nBarry commits at least one big error: he's horrified by the medical schools of the time having \"no standards for admission\":\r\n<blockquote><i>  In research and education especially, American medicine lagged far behind [European medicine]... At least one hundred US medical schools would accept any man willing to pay tuition... and only a single medical school required its student to have a college degree... the Johns Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid [its] faculty salaries, and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but fluency in French and German and a background of science courses. \r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nBut his enthusiasm for Johns Hopkins introducing the college degree requirement is misplaced. Contemporary US doctors (who all have 3 years of pre-med, or even more college, before they start medical training) are probably no better clinicians than undergraduate doctors in other countries, and are far further in debt. This requirement is probably one reason the American system is so fucked.\r\n\r\nI suppose Barry is just confusing the open admissions situation with the schools' appallingly low graduation standards, which is certainly one reason eC20th medicine sucked. (Many doctors had never looked down a microscope, never used a stethoscope on a patient, never seen a dissection.)\r\n---\r\n\r\nPS: Mostly unimportant corrections by a virologist <a href=\"http://www.virology.ws/2009/08/14/the-problems-with-barrys-the-great-influenza/\">here</a>.

    "review": "    Read this because I am an unironic fan of the author's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdsT0oJIPQM\">hip-hop opera</a> about the luridly dystopian consequences of saying 'No' to the Scottish referendum. But it peaks with its epigram, Tom Leonard's \"<a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DvG30pFX4AAEV2d.jpg\">Liason Coordinator</a>\".\n\nMore of an autobiography than I was expecting, lots about his own insecurities and appalling suffering, the quasi-political rage inspired by them, and his slow maturing into social work and art. Unfortunately the prose is really, really stiff. One of his observations is that poverty makes you unable to articulate poverty. So should I sympathise? I've a similarly uncultured background (though not a tenth as violent) and I still managed to get an ear for High English. (He isn't deep enough to analyse the politics of language, but he namechecks people who do, like Tom Leonard.)\n\nAnd but you <i>can</i> write in Scots now, if you're great, if you're brave, as shown by Welsh (Booker Prize longlist '93), Kelman (Booker win '94) and Leonard (anthologised in the <i>Penguin Book of English Verse</i>, IMO the highest honour in poetry).\n<blockquote><i>my sense of grievance with anyone I perceived as well-off. In my community, some people fought about football, others over politics and religion, but my simmering resentment, if not concentrated completely on my mother, lay with those in society who appeared to be doing much better than the rest of us, those who were gliding through life unimpeded by the constraints of poverty and the material disadvantage and self-doubt that comes with it.\n\nThis feeling of justifiable anger at the state of things, whether it be my community of even my own life, always led to some form of blame being ascribed to another group in society and, for me, middle class people fitted the bill perfectly. This bee in my bonnett has been a constant and finds expression as a sense of irritation at certain people I assume are posh; I can be irritated by an opinion, an accent, an accessory or an item of clothing...\n</blockquote></i>\n\n    Many big sociological / psychology claims - some truisms, some false - but almost no citations for either. (e.g. He has this harebrained idea that Florida is a rich high-status place, when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_poverty_rate\">5 seconds on wiki</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Man\">passing familiarity</a> with American memes gives the lie to that.) \"according to Wikipedia\" is as far as the scholarship goes.\n\nOne intriguing detail about lC20th poverty: \"<i>you keep the big blue crate of European Union stew you've been donated well out of view</i>\" - <a href=\"https://www.eurofoodbank.org/images/cont/position-paper-fead---review_file.pdf\">food aid</a> to Scotland in the 90s! Our \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_cheese\">government cheese</a>\".\n\nThere's a surprising section where he tries to tie Seneca and the other good old lads to modern common sense, to do some genealogy of morals, but he can't carry it. He also tries to square the circle of the giant malevolent nature/nuture catfight, but understandably can't lift that either. (He's more on the personal responsibility side than you'd expect for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollok_Country_Park#Protests\">Pollok Free Stater</a>.)",

    "review": "A book about an unwritten book about a writer I don't like much. And it's amazing! Not a study of Lawrence, a study of trying to write when you lack an iron will. So also a study of all work, so a study of the hard generation of value, and so, despite appearances, a study of what matters.\n\nThe prose is circuitous, cantatory, shaggy-dog, but never dull:\n<blockquote><i> Oxford! Now if there is one place on earth where you cannot, where it is physically impossible to write a book about Lawrence it is here, in Oxford. You could write a book about plenty of writers in Oxford: Hardy, or Joyce even — people are probably doing just that, even now, dozens of them — but not Lawrence. If there is one person you cannot write a book about here, in Oxford, it is Lawrence. So I have made doubly sure that there is no chance of my finishing my study of Lawrence: he is the one person you cannot write about here, in Oxford; and Oxford is the one place where you cannot write about Lawrence.\n\n When I say you can’t possibly write a book about Lawrence in Oxford that is not to be taken too literally. At this moment, within a few miles of my flat, dozens of people are probably writing books about Lawrence. That tapping I can hear through my open window is probably someone writing a book or a thesis or preparing a lecture, or, at the very least, doing an essay on D. H. Lawrence. It can be done. It can be done — but it can’t be done, it shouldn’t be done. You can’t write a half-decent book about Lawrence in Oxford, can’t write any kind of book about Lawrence without betraying him totally. By doing so you immediately disqualify yourself, render yourself ineligible. It is like spitting on his grave.</i></blockquote>\n\nFor a while I amused myself by seeing how many consecutive sentences used the same phrase, in a running stitch motif. He is playing a character, but like Rob Brydon does: only slightly heightened.\n\nOne long stream of scenes, unthemed, unbracketed. He is the critic I would have hoped to be: sceptical of the novel, sceptical of the spiritual pretensions of artists, sceptical of children, sceptical of travel and sceptical of home, sceptical of self. He is free to admit his boredom and his joy, unlike the academic critics he often erupts against. Here is the key passage (not that you can trust him to cleave to it twenty years or minutes on):\n<blockquote><i>Hearing that I was ‘working on Lawrence’, an acquaintance lent me a book he thought I might find interesting: A </i>Longman Critical Reader<i> on Lawrence, edited by Peter Widdowson. I glanced at the contents page: old Eagleton was there, of course, together with some other state-of-the-fart theorists: Lydia Blanchard on ‘Lawrence, Foucault and the Language of Sexuality’ (in the section on ‘Gender, Sexuality, Feminism’), Daniel J. Schneider on ‘Alternatives to Logocentrism in D. H. Lawrence’ (in the section featuring ‘Post-Structuralist Turns’). I could feel myself getting angry and then I flicked through the introductory essay on ‘Radical Indeterminacy: a post-modern Lawrence’ and became angrier still. How could it have happened? How could these people with no feeling for literature have ended up teaching it, writing about it? I should have stopped there, should have avoided looking at any more, but I didn’t because telling myself to stop always has the effect of urging me on. Instead, I kept looking at this group of wankers huddled in a circle, backs turned to the world so that no one would see them pulling each other off. Oh, it was too much, it was too stupid. I threw the book across the room and then I tried to tear it up but it was too resilient. By now I was blazing mad...\n\n I burned it in self-defence. It was the book or me - writing like that kills everything it touches. That is the hallmark of academic criticism: it kills everything it touches. Walk around a university campus and there is an almost palpable smell of death about the place because hundreds of academics are busy killing everything they touch. I recently met an academic who said that he taught German literature. I was aghast: to think, this man who had been in universities all his life was teaching Rilke. </i>Rilke<i>! Oh, it was too much to bear. You don’t teach Rilke, I wanted to say, you kill Rilke! You turn him to dust and then you go off to conferences where dozens of other academic-morticians gather with the express intention of killing Rilke and turning him to dust. Then, as part of the cover-up, the conference papers are published, the dust is embalmed and before you know it literature is a vast graveyard of dust, a dustyard of graves. I was beside myself with indignation. I wanted to maim and harm this polite, well-meaning academic who, for all I knew, was a brilliant teacher who had turned on generations of students to the </i>Duino Elegies<i>. Still, I thought to myself the following morning when I had calmed down, the general point stands: how can you know anything about literature if all you’ve done is read books? \n\n Now, criticism is an integral part of the literary tradition and academics can sometimes write excellent works of criticism but these are exceptions - the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of books by academics, especially books like that </i>Longman Reader<i> are a crime against literature. </i></blockquote>\n\nThe final passage hits you over the head with what you have certainly already worked out, but it is still very powerful. Dyer is inspiring, pure nevertheless:\n<blockquote><i>One way or another we all have to write our studies of D. H. Lawrence. Even if they will never be published, even if we will never complete them, even if all we are left with after years and years of effort is an unfinished, unfinishable record of how we failed to live up to our own earlier ambitions, still we all have to try to make some progress with our books about D. H. Lawrence. The world over, from Taos to Taormina, from the places we have visited to countries we will never set foot in, the best we can do is to try to make some progress with our studies of D. H. Lawrence.</i></blockquote>\n",

    "review": "<blockquote><i>I don’t know whether there are any moral saints. But if there are, I am glad that neither I nor those about whom I care most are among them... The moral virtues, present... to an extreme degree, are apt to crowd out the non-moral virtues, as well as many of the interests and personal characteristics that we generally think contribute to a healthy,\r\nwell-rounded, richly developed character... there seems to be a limit to how much morality we can stand.</i><a href=\"http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/susanwolfessay1982.pdf\">– Susan Wolf</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>...the moral narcissist’s extreme humility masked a dreadful pride. Ordinary people could accept that they had faults; the moral narcissist could not. To </i>[André]<i> Green this moral straining was sinister, for the moral narcissist would do anything to preserve his purity, even when doing so carried a terrible price... new qualifiers appeared: there was \"pseudo-altruism\", a defensive cloak for sadomasochism; and there was \"psychotic altruism\", bizarre care-taking behaviour based in delusion... the analyst surmised that the masking of their own hostility and greed from themselves might be one of altruism's functions for people of this type.</i>\r\n– Larissa MacFarquhar</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>...we cannot and should not become impartial, </i>[Bernard Williams]<i> argued, because doing so would mean abandoning what gives human life meaning. Without selfish partiality—to people you are deeply attached to, your wife and your children, your friends, to work that you love and that is particularly yours, to beauty, to place — we are nothing. We are creatures of intimacy and kinship and loyalty, not blind servants of the world.</i>\r\n– Larissa MacFarquhar</blockquote>\r\n\r\nTwelve profiles of recent radical altruists, and the backlash they receive from the rest of us. (^) Besides, MacFarquhar has some deep reflections on the good life and human nature to work through. So: There are people who shape their lives around the need of the world – in particular around strangers who are <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/diseases/en/\">constantly</a>, in some sense, drowning. This category of person does more than just work a caring job and be dead nice to those around them: instead, their entire lives are dominated by the attempt to do the <i>most</i> good.\r\nThe profiled altruists are:\r\n<ul>\r\n- <li><a href=\"http://www.peacehost.net/Dorothy/\">A fairly fearless nurse</a> who organised the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_for_Life\">Fast for Life</a> and trained generations of Nicaraguan nurses, continuing for thirty years despite specific threats to her life by Contras.</li>\r\n- <li>A pseudonymous animal rights activist who has rescued or won improved conditions for millions of chickens.</li>\r\n- <li>Two early effective altruists, <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/whats-it-like-to-give-half.html\">Julia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/earning-to-give-transcript\">Jeff</a>, who live frugally and donate more than half of their salaries to the most effective NGOs in the world. They plausibly save 100 lives a year, far more than a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/08/how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save/\">doctor</a> or <a href=\"https://www.fbu.org.uk/download/file/fid/2915\">firefighter</a> (even before considering replaceability).</li>\r\n- <li><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/07/27/the-kindest-cut\">A real Christian</a>, who opened her church to the homeless (over the hostility of her flock) and donated a kidney anonymously.</li><a name=\"data\"></a>\r\n- <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Amte\">A charismatic, outcaste social worker and jungle statesman</a>, who created <a href=\"http://anandwan.in/anandwan/\">a self-sustaining leper ashram</a>, 5000-strong, out of nothing. Also his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikas_Amte\">equally</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Amte\">hardcore</a> descendents.</li>\r\n- <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/itte2nemo10\">A Buddhist monk</a> who created the largest suicide counselling site in Japan, stressing himself into heart disease.</li>\r\n- <li><a href=\"http://www.badeaufamily.com/ouradoptionstory.htm\">The omni-parents of Vermont</a>, who adopted 24 of the least cute and easy children on the lists.</li>\r\n- <li>A taciturn altruistic kidney donor.</li>\r\n- <li>A burned-out idealist.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n(<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VMjFJpgyxQZ6jGj0SN_QMMBPj0eSSnFuXpQ49FuYG9Y/edit?usp=sharing\">I've compiled data on their nature here</a>.*)\r\n\r\nMacFarquhar appears suspicious about these people, whose lives are taken over by their morals. She calls them \"do-gooders\" while admitting the term is dismissive.** Even the most humble and quiet do-gooder is, she thinks, making an extremely arrogant claim: that the moral intuitions of the whole species - i.e. family favouritism, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supererogation\">supererogation</a>, the right to ignore the suffering of strangers - are totally wrong. She leaves no-one unsuspected.\r\n<blockquote><i>an extreme morality as Singer's or Godwin's can seem not just oppressively demanding but actually evil, because it violates your duty to yourself. To require a person to think of himself as a tool for the general good could be seen as equivalent of kidnapping a person off the street and harvesting his organs to save three or four lives... even to ask this of yourself seems wrong, even perverted. Impartial, universal love seems the antithesis of what we value about deep human attachment.</i></blockquote>\r\nBut these lives are victory laps: the victory of broad reason over narrow animality. MacFarquhar is more nuanced, less willing to dismiss particularism, nepotism and speciesism – which are together known as common sense. (Though I have only a mild case of the radicals: for instance, I am mostly immune to misery about the state of the world, and I help my loved ones without much guilt. I'm <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:YclKt_ybNHMJ:https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk\">giving 10% now</a> and 50% eventually, but I am such a bookish scruff that the absence of luxuries does not really cramp my life at all.)\r\n\r\nOne part of Williams' humanist case against radical altruism has dissolved in the last decade: the idea that single-minded ethical focus must erode your connection to your community. Well, the effective altruists are growing in number and maturity; they <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/get-involved/\">offer a deep, global community</a> of at least partially serious people to support and be supported by: and all with the stamp of moral consistency.\r\n\r\nMacFarquhar doesn't much like utilitarianism, but she is too moved and impressed with her subjects to take the standard, safe, quietist line (which her <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/18407/helping-a-drowning-stranger\">reviewers</a> have tended to). Throughout, she presents contradictory philosophical propositions, and makes it difficult to know which she believes; she constantly uses indirect speech and deictic discussion, blurring her voice with the debate at hand. This is, I think, an impressive rhetorical strategy – an \"<a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/10/philosophy-between-the-lines.html\">esoteric</a>\" one. The book is addressed to common sense readers, but also to our uncertainty and faint guilt; it's dedicated to her parents, but explicitly constructed to bring us closer to the altruists:\r\n<a name=\"longcon\"></a>\r\n<blockquote><i>I took out all the physical descriptions because if you’re looking at someone’s physical appearance, you’re on the outside. Similarly quotations, which seem as though they should be the most intimate form, because they come directly from the person’s mouth. Again, in fact, the only way you hear someone speaking is if you’re outside them. So if you translate quotation into interior thought, which simply means taking away the quotation marks and saying ‘he thought’ rather than ‘he said’ – that’s a more intimate way of encountering someone.</i>***</blockquote>\r\nSo <i>Strangers Drowning</i> covertly brings us closer to radical altruism. Her task is not to establish their ethical premises, nor to win over new obsessives: instead, she simply shows us their sincerity and incredible effects on the world – and, better, shows the lack of evidence and interpretive charity behind their opponents' aspersions. (This goes for the Freudians, the Objectivists, and the anti \"codependency\" crowd.) It humanises the threatening side of ultimate goodness. She mostly avoids editorialising about the radicals. But one of her clear conclusions is that these people are not deficient, instead having something most people lack:\r\n<blockquote><i>What do-gooders lack is not happiness but innocence. They lack that happy blindness that allows most people, most of the time, to shut their minds to what is unbearable. Do-gooders have forced themselves to know, and keep on knowing, that everything they do affects other people, and that sometimes (though not always) their joy is purchased with other people's joy. And, remembering that, they open themselves to a sense of unlimited, crushing responsibility...\r\n\r\nThe </i>need<i> of the world was like death, </i>[Julia]<i> thought — everyone knew about it, but the thought was so annihilating that they had to push it out of consciousness or it would crush them. She understood, and yet did not understand, why other people didn't give more than they did. How did they allow themselves such permission? How could they not help?</i></blockquote>\r\nwhile also noting that, in general\r\n<blockquote><i>If there is a struggle between morality and life, life will win... Not always, not in every case, but life will win in the end. Sometimes a person will die for a cause; sometimes a person will give up for duty's sake the things that are to him most precious. But most of the time, the urge to live, to give to your family, to seek beauty, to act spontaneously... or to do any number of things other than helping people, is too strong to be overridden... It may be true that not everyone should be a do-gooder. But it is also true that these strange, hopeful, tough, idealistic, demanding, life-threatening, and relentless people, by their extravagant example, help keep those life-sustaining qualities alive.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAn amazing book, anyway: charged, critical, structurally ingenious, and filled with humanity – or, with this other, better thing.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LZ2UPDZqwSA/V__tmcnCXEI/AAAAAAAACvE/-2kGPLHaqbkV3j6ZDK_XbqP6G5SD5toNQCLcB/s1600/selung.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LZ2UPDZqwSA/V__tmcnCXEI/AAAAAAAACvE/-2kGPLHaqbkV3j6ZDK_XbqP6G5SD5toNQCLcB/s640/selung.png\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\"></a>\r\n<small>\"Sedia hujan sebelum payung\" (c) <a href=\"http://zakyarifin.tumblr.com/post/134379295094/sedia-hujan-sebelum-payung-ohrainydays\r\n\">Zaky Arifin</a> (2015)</small></div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<sup>†</sup> Note the absent quotation marks around MacFarquhar's report of the psychoanalysts' and Williams' positions. \r\n\r\nThe chapter on the blitheness and cruelty of the psychoanalysts enraged me - all the more because MacFarquhar leaves their unscientific bullshit unchallenged, instead letting it mock and degrade itself. (One hopes.) <i>So much</i> glibness and spite:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:120px;font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'\">ANNA FREUD:</td>\r\n<td><i>Altruists are bossy, because the urge that is usually behind the fulfillment of one's own wishes is now placed behind the fulfillment of the wishes of another person.

After all, the bossiness of do-gooders is proverbial...</i></td>\r\n</tr></tbody></table></blockquote>\r\n(My, what rigorous science.) So, here's yet <i>another</i> way I am fortunate to live when I do: these people have by now been mostly sidelined in polite discourse. The harm they are able to do is much reduced, and I need not spend my whole life convincing people that they are just making things up. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Philosophy - e.g. Peter Singer, Will MacAskill, Toby Ord, Mark Lee, Geoff Anders, Stephanie Wykstra - <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Su7GCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT6&dq=strangers+drowning&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=philosoph&f=false\">looms large here</a>, in this little corner of the race; larger than organised religion. Since all of the philosophers are from Analytic departments, this gives the lie to <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/when-philosophy-lost-its-way/?_r=1\">the generalised standard criticism</a> of academic philosophy (: that they are fatally detached from the concerns of society, dehumanised, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\n** \"Do-gooder\" is still much better than Susan Wolf's term, \"moral saint\", because, as MacFarquhar notes, to call someone a saint is to nullify the challenge of their difficult actions: saints are not just 'people who do really good things'; they are (thought to be) a different sort of being. Any movement (like EA) which seeks to make radical altruism mainstream has to resist this demarcation and get people to see such a life as, first, good; then, possible for them; and then reasonable - the sort of thing that people would do if they thought about it more. \r\n\r\n*** MacFarquhar's account of Stephanie is misleading: she makes it seem like she has opted for ordinary amoral innocence, where <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swykstr\">the real Stephanie</a> has taken on <a href=\"http://www.senseaboutscienceusa.org/hanging-onto-hope-what-its-like-to-participate-in-a-clinical-trial/\">an incredibly high-impact job</a>, activism for oversight of pharmaceutical clinical trial data. \r\n\r\n\r\n[<a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Data #2, Values #2</a>]\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content float-container\" id=\"post-body-6807304552804061365\">\r\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6HAPdCFJ_Wk/V__sCOZNUEI/AAAAAAAACu4/kZvkG28lVuIFXr0Hhfqe0RpRMbr1li_6ACLcB/s1600/optikaa.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6HAPdCFJ_Wk/V__sCOZNUEI/AAAAAAAACu4/kZvkG28lVuIFXr0Hhfqe0RpRMbr1li_6ACLcB/s640/optikaa.png\" height=\"385\" border=\"0\" width=\"380\"></a>\r\n<small>\"Optikaa\" (c) <a href=\"http://zakyarifin.tumblr.com/post/127737292589/upcoming-collaboration-with-bagusikalisasi\">Zaky Arifin</a> (2015)</small>",

    "review": "Ponderous and mean, gnomic and agnostic, as usual. Lots of good details about oafishness and gendered crappiness between and within genders, as usual. Her friend applying makeup is\r\n<blockquote><i>a seamed and folded imitation of a magazine picture that is itself an imitation of a woman who is also an imitation, the original nowhere, hairless lobed angel in the same heaven where God is a circle, captive princess in someone's head. She is locked in, she isn't allowed to eat or shit or cry or give birth, nothing goes in, nothing comes out. She takes her clothes off or puts them on, paper doll wardrobe, she copulates under strobe lights with the man's torso while his brain watches from its glassed-in control cubicle at the other end of the room, her face twists into poses of exultation and total abandonment, that is all. </blockquote></i>\r\nThe anti-Americanism of the (Canadian) protagonists - so venomous it actually deserves the full title racism - is funny. It hides behind deep-ecology and Romantic critique: <blockquote><i>It doesn’t matter what country they’re from, my head said, they’re still Americans, they’re what’s in store for us, what we are turning into. They spread themselves like a virus...  Second-hand American was spreading over him in patches, like mange or lichen. He was infested, garbled, and I couldn’t help him...\r\n\r\nMy country, sold or drowned, a reservoir; the people were sold along with the land and the animals...\r\n\r\nI realized it wasn't the men I hated, it was the Americans, the human beings, men and women both. They'd had their chance but they had turned against the gods, and it was time for me to choose sides. I wanted there to be a machine that could make them vanish, a button I could press that would evaporate them without disturbing anything else, that way there would be more room for the animals, they would be rescued\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nDavid (a rapey leftist idiot) is anti-Yank from the start, but the narrator eventually sinks into a similar kind of hallucinatory environmentalist racism, as part of her rejection of 'the city' and the modern world.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear why her friends are her friends, since they are trivial and cruel, as she is (initially) not. There's maybe one sympathetic character in the whole book, a taciturn Quebecois handyman who doesn't symbolise much of anything, as far as I can see (not the city, sure, but neither her mystical primitive).\r\n\r\nThe narrator is full of non sequiturs like \"<i>If you tell your children God doesn’t exist they will be forced to believe you are the god</i>\", little anti-rational digs which never go challenged. Just because both revolution (David) and the status quo (\"Americans\"), men and women, are awful, doesn't mean that nature is any better.\r\n\r\nShe starts off with strong run-on stream of consciousness - <blockquote><i>I slide my tongue around the ice cream, trying to concentrate on it, they put seaweed in it now, but I'm starting to shake, why is the road different, he shouldn’t have allowed them to do it, I want to turn around and go back to the city and never find out what happened to him. I’ll start crying, that would be horrible, none of them would know what to do and neither would I. I bite down into the cone and I can’t feel anything for a minute but the knife-hard pain up the side of my face. Anaesthesia, that’s one technique: if it hurts invent a different pain. I’m all right.</blockquote></i> - but apparently forgets this sentence structure about halfway through.\r\n\r\nOddly, it's sort of mirror of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Dream_(novel)\">An American Dream</a></i>: the same atavism, same disgust with modernity, but with violence suffered rather than gleefully inflicted.\r\n\r\n<i>Surfacing</i> gets called 'important'. I suppose because of the affectless, doubting-feminist agency of a divorcee angle; I hope it isn't because people think the protagonist had an admirable spiritual journey when really she's driven insane by mistreatment and boredom.",

The physicists speak to us here in full sentences, with little of the fragmentariness and repetition of real speech. And it takes someone as highly trained as Bernstein to get us over the technical barrier.) Even so, this is as plain and self-interpreting as history gets. For six months they play madlibs, argue, and run around the garden, while the English and we listen in.\r\n\r\nHahn is a sweetheart and von Laue a droopy hero. The Party functionary Diebner is comic, even though he has most responsibility for the Nazi weapons project. Harteck is the most technically astute by far: he guesses a huge amount correctly, all in the teeth of loud ignorance by his more prestigious peers. von Weizsacker is the slimiest. Heisenberg is just <i>weird</i>: he has a very faint echo of the strange clear-sight-and-moral-vacuum of Eichmann. Enormous intelligence and no sense.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VQ3rBmTP0Jk/WUUembjf4WI/AAAAAAAAC8c/8stKhuSGkHgL2uJ4gzfZl5y4PSDwuMB_wCLcBGAs/s1600/farmhall1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"642\" data-original-width=\"561\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VQ3rBmTP0Jk/WUUembjf4WI/AAAAAAAAC8c/8stKhuSGkHgL2uJ4gzfZl5y4PSDwuMB_wCLcBGAs/s400/farmhall1.png\" width=\"500\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\nThe morality of their wartime actions does not come up very much (except when raised by sweetheart Hahn or von Laue). They are mostly glad of the destruction of the Nazis, and Wirtz is horrified by the scale and singularity of SS murder. But the rest are more self-regarding than pro or anti Nazi. (Again, it is wonderful to read these and actually know they meant it.)\r\n\r\n(What about the morality of our reading the reports? I don't have a clear opinion, but doing so after their deaths seems mostly fair.)\r\n\r\nThey very often speak about money, Heisenberg in particular. (Not just research funding or aid for their families in Occupied Germany, but dolla dolla bills.) On hearing that Hahn had won a Nobel:\r\n<blockquote><i> \"it says that you are supposed to receive the Nobel Prize for 1944.\" The excitement that struck the ten detainees at this moment is hard to describe in a few words. Hahn did not believe it at first. In the beginning he turned away all the offers of congratulations. But gradually we broke through, with Heisenberg in the lead, who congratulated him heartily on the 6200 pounds.\r\n</blockquote></i> \r\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cn_v4WT9cg4/WUUexaFbGdI/AAAAAAAAC8k/Encilxn-h3E3sQcRazdGfs8kNsdp_6mNQCLcBGAs/s1600/farmhall3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"267\" data-original-width=\"538\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cn_v4WT9cg4/WUUexaFbGdI/AAAAAAAAC8k/Encilxn-h3E3sQcRazdGfs8kNsdp_6mNQCLcBGAs/s400/farmhall3.png\" width=\"500\" /></a></div>\r\nAs you can see, Bernstein's editorial voice is a bit strong. But his other qualities are huge and unique: he knew some of the protagonists personally, and worked on nuclear weaponry himself. He <i>is</i> out to get Heisenberg, and overreads a few times. But this is because people (Powers, Frayn to a degree) persist in rose-tinting him: there's this idea that Heisenberg feigned incompetence at reactor-making as anti-Nazi activism. The transcripts make clear that he'd have made a bomb if he could, not because he is a Nazi or a German but because he was amorally curious, and hungry for primacy. Heisenberg does object to Nazism. But not very strongly. \r\n\r\nBernstein's conclusion is that the project was pretty much a shambles. They had a two-year head start on the Allies, but failed for several reasons: they had < 1% of the funding of the Manhattan Project, an unbelievably bad administration and communication of data and ideas, and key resources like deuterium kept getting bombed. But Bernstein feels able to go for the jugular: \r\n<blockquote><i> reading this lecture, I am once again struck by the intellectual thinness of this group. Here are ten German nuclear scientists — nine if one does not count von Laue — who are supposed to be the cream of the crop, the intellectual elite, of German nuclear physics, men who had been working on these questions for several years. And look at the discussion it produced.\r\n\r\n To see what I have in mind, let us entertain the following fantasy. Suppose the tables had been turned and ten of the best Allied scientists had been interned in Göttingen when a hypothetical German atomic bomb went off. Whom shall we include? Fermi, Bethe, Feynman, Serber, Wigner, von Neumann, Oppenheimer, Peierls, Ulam, Teller, Bohr, Frisch, Weisskopf... What would the technical conversation have been like? No doubt there would have been disagreements and some fumbling. But like this? The question answers itself.</i></blockquote>\r\nYet <i>even with these handicaps</i>, it looks like Harteck could have built a basic pile in 1940, if the project was headed by someone less arrogant than Heisenberg. And that pile would have brought all the funding, and maybe sorted out their many collective muddles and lack of engineering care.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rm6rozsP8oI/WU5mD4y91qI/AAAAAAAAC9U/Y7KjU-bOkdUgt39lfTwzdUIs6CYhF4FTwCLcBGAs/s1600/a%2Bbit%2Bmuch.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"160\" data-original-width=\"732\" height=\"140\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rm6rozsP8oI/WU5mD4y91qI/AAAAAAAAC9U/Y7KjU-bOkdUgt39lfTwzdUIs6CYhF4FTwCLcBGAs/s640/a%2Bbit%2Bmuch.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n5/5 for Bernstein's commentary and the hair-raising fact of their existence.",

But it's as much moral as geographic or historical. China had only just opened up to foreigners, again; the Cultural Revolution, just 15 years past, looms large. A lost generation. In fact the book is obsessed with the difficult question, \"How could they do that to themselves?\", a focus which makes it excellent, informal long-form journalism as much as gentleman's what-ho travel narrative.\r\n<blockquote><i>The man went on: 'We found a porter who had been reading novels with a love interest. I don't mean porn. Just a personal story. This was decadent. We beat him unconscious, and burnt the books. Then he died.'\r\nI looked at him in astonishment, mesmerised, for some reason, by his immaculately pressed trousers. Once the armour of social constraint had been stripped from him, the person inside had been exposed as a baby: conscienceless. Was that China, I wondered, or just him? In any case, where was that feeling of pity which Mencius said was common to all men? </i></blockquote>\r\nThe question isn't as simply answered as <a href=\"http://www.clivejames.com/evenaswespeak/hitler\">it is for Hitler's Germany</a> (answer: \"Because the merest dissent by any German meant death\") nor even as it is for Stalinist Russia (since the unbelievable violence of the Holodomor and gulags was meted out by a <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/NKVD\">comparatively small number of people</a>). Millions of educated Red Guards brutalised millions of untrendy people without much central control at all (indeed, they often revolted against and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Guards_%28China%29#Role_in_the_Cultural_Revolution\">scared the shit out</a> of the PLA and the apparatchiks).\r\n\r\nThubron's important points include: that the Party cadres are nothing more than the latest garb of the long, long line of elite mandarins. So the poor <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Baixing\">Laobaixing</a> got all the downside of an absolutist bureaucracy <i>plus</i> all the incompetence and terror caused by people who think that violent unending revolution is desirable. Another large theme is the appalling state of women: The patriarchy there was without even the paltry sweetener of chivalry - married off at 14 if not murdered as infants; old women sitting in the aisles of busses while young men lounge, etc, etc. \r\n\r\nMany of the people he meets (mostly lower-middle-class) were (<a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hukou_system\">are</a>?) unbelievably obsessed with class, even after forty years of 'communist' rule; the brief, cursory glorification of the nongmin bounced back as soon as the big sticks went away. He calculates the cost of things - TVs, train tickets, hotel whiskies - in that most decent of measures, fractions of an average worker's monthly wage. \r\n\r\nThere is, already in 1987, an ambitious, irreverent, apolitical youth which any graduate of a Western university will now recognise readily.** The modern Modern China - Deng's China - is visible here, just. Thubron watches the future radiating out from the city:\r\n<blockquote><i>Under the enormous vault of the station hall there resounds the tramp of a newly mobilised peasantry. I have seen them before all over the city: families arrived to buy or trade, sleeping under bridges or in shop porches with cap over their eyes. Now they step on to the escalators as gingerly as Western eight-year-olds, laden with rope-trussed boxes, newly bought televisions, chickens in hampers, radios, bags spilling out fruit and biscuits - bearing El Dorado back to the village. They overflow the waiting-rooms and camp against every wall behind their baggage palisades, snoring open-mouthed through the din with the detachment of Brueghel swineherds, their children in their arms.</i></blockquote>\r\nHis wit, compassionate anger, gravitas, and grasp of the detail of how messily old collides with new: all recall my favourite critic, Jonathan Meades. (Though Meades is a bit too refined to be easily imagined sleeping fifth-class amidst spit and melon rind, or buying a barn owl in a meat market just to set it free.)\r\n\r\nHe reports much local bullshit, sarcastically (e.g. Northerners' notion that 'moral integrity' decreases as you go south). This makes it sometimes difficult to know which reportage he endorses: thus, a couple of outlandish claims are possibly deadpan jokes (e.g. only '100' cars on mainland China in 1987?? Human flesh on sale in Canton?\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the book received a dab of cursory post-colonial critique.* This is unsurprising because he is interested in <i>testing</i> stereotypes out - in particular, finding out if innate cruelty enabled the Cultural Revolution; it is thus not unfair to imagine the book as a Eurocentric hatchet job. But this dismissive cynicism is only possible <i>before</i> you've heard his frank encounters with a hundred vivid, intelligent, and mournful locals, seen his solid grasp of the history of the dynasties and of 'pedantic and kindly' Confucianism. (Which is the best description of it I've ever seen.) \r\n\r\nThose interviews <i>are</i> novelistic - impossibly sincere, compressed, tragic, poetic - and far beyond anything I could elicit as a foreigner, in my summer there. But you believe him even so. Anyway he doesn't pretend to have answered his burning question:\r\n<blockquote><i>'This sort of thing isn't peculiar to my country,' the priest said: he might have been thought-reading. 'Look at Germany, Russia. Of course, those countries are not old civilisations like ours, but still...'\r\n\r\nOf course. I was wading into an ocean. He was listening patiently, but I could not assemble any coherent thoughts. I wanted to explain that it was not the presence of cruelty which surprised me, but some imbalance between obedience and mercy, the collapse of domestic compassion in the face of official demand, the refinements of tortures practiced against teachers and friends, the denunciation of parents - but I stumbled into inarticulacy. I was juggling only with my own values, not with theirs. I knew nothing.</i> \r\n</blockquote>\r\nI oughtn't skimp on the book's adventure-story side just because it happens to be a beautiful and humane psychological portrait; the prose is persistently gorgeous, the sights are dryly and comprehensively evoked, and Thubron presents himself as a very fine comic character to boot. My favourite China book.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\r\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YL_XZ59eGzI/VoRXREWNXTI/AAAAAAAACeU/9hyqdf8jZjs/s1600/liguanxiu2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"540\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YL_XZ59eGzI/VoRXREWNXTI/AAAAAAAACeU/9hyqdf8jZjs/s640/liguanxiu2.jpg\" width=\"740\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n* Anti-Eurocentrism used to minimise totalitarian genocide can be found in <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Dhc8zMwewsAC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22Momentarily+my+head+filled+with+savage%22&source=bl&ots=_XFlg8jFSa&sig=c3ImLO0L9hVAXBMWuJpEoeahr4A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi_t8XopoTKAhXIWxoKHbmbBegQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=questioning%20his%20sources&f=false\">the critical discussion of Thubron here</a>, the snob passage around the dismaying line: \"<i>In Thurbron's mind</i>, the Cultural Revolution reached the epitome of atrocities in terms of intensity and scope...\" (emphasis mine).

Generally overwrought, and you can get them in a minute or two each time, unlike the bizarre original koans, which demand convoluted confabulation.\n\nBut '<i>Codeless Code</i>' is an instance of an important genre: the <i>romanticisation of the highly abstract and novel</i>. We need such things; otherwise those of us without internal wellsprings of meaning will find it boring, and will thus never excel; otherwise a culture will never grow, and nothing human lasts without growing a culture. There is enough art, except regarding new matters, new concepts, new possibilities, where there is nowhere near enough. \n\n\"Ah!\", you say, \"But Yudkowsky <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/p1/initiation_ceremony/\">did just this</a>, and got roundly mocked and called a <a href=\"https://ironicalcoincidings.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/the-cult-of-bayes/\">cult leader</a> and divers other bad things.\" Yes: that is the main tax we pay to be on the internet. I think of Yudkowsky as George Eliot thinks of Carlyle (though she hated him btw):\n<blockquote><blockquote><i>\n...the highest aim in education is analogous to the highest aim in mathematics, namely, to obtain not results but powers, not particular solutions, but the means by which endless solutions may be wrought. He is the most effective educator who aims less at perfecting specific acquirements than at producing that mental condition which renders acquirements easy, and leads to their useful application...\n\nOn the same ground it may be said that the most effective writer is... he who rouses in others the activities that must issue in discovery, who awakes men from their indifference to the right and the wrong, who nerves their energies to seek for the truth and live up to it at whatever cost... he clears away the film from your eyes that you may search for data to some purpose. He does not, perhaps, convince you, but he strikes you, undeceives you, animates you. You are not directly fed by his books, but you are braced as by a walk up to an alpine summit, and yet subdued to calm and reverence as by the sublime things to be seen from that summit.  Such a writer is Thomas Carlyle. \n\nIt is an idle question to ask whether his books will be read a century hence: if they were all burnt as the grandest of Suttees on his funeral pile, it would be only like cutting down an oak after its acorns have sown a forest. For there is hardly a superior or active mind of this generation that has not been modified by Carlyle’s writings; there has hardly been an English book written for the last ten or twelve years that would not have been different if Carlyle had not lived... The extent of his influence may be best seen in the fact that ideas which were startling novelties when he first wrote them are now become common-places. And we think few men will be found to say that this influence on the whole has not been for good... </blockquote></blockquote></i>\n(Who didn't start the fire...)\n\n[<a href=\"http://thecodelesscode.com/case/27\">Free here</a>]\n[<a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Thinking #3, Theory #2</a>]\n",

So, superficially, the book is just about an especially  <a name=\"people\"></a>fruity context of discovery. But this period holds two of the most important lessons in history: 1) science grew out of work by people who diverge wildly from the modern idea and practice of science, whose variously false frameworks led to the Royal Society and e.g. the Newtonian triumph. (And from there to contemporary, professional, university science.) So wrong people can still make progress if their errors are uncorrelated with the prevailing errors. And, 2) a small number of the most powerful people in Britain - the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon\">Lord Chancellor</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Scarborough\">king's</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey#Excursions_abroad.2C_election_as_physician_to_Charles_I_and_the_English_Civil_War\">physicians</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkins\">the chaplain</a> of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_Louis,_Elector_Palatine\">young Elector Palatine</a> and bishop of Chester, London's great <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren#Architectural_career\">architect</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moray\">Privy Councillors</a> <a href=\"#bigfrankb\">*</a> - successfully pushed a massive philosophical change, and thereby contributed to most of our greatest achievements: smallpox eradication, Sputnik and Voyager, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution\">Green Revolution</a>, and the unmanageably broad boons of computing are partly theirs. \r\n\r\nThe received view of all this is one-dimensional: you have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_Concerning_the_Two_Chief_World_Systems\">superstitious, pompous cretins</a> at one end and rational, experimental moderns at the other.\r\n\r\nBut really you need five axes before you get a basic understanding of the great, great revolution that began in the C16th - before you can see how science differs from every other community: \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Supernaturalism vs Naturalism</b>. Did they explain things solely in terms of natural causes? (Absentee Gods only.)</li>\r\n<li><b>Apriori vs Aposteriori</b>. Did they view actual observation as decisive and indispensable? <a href=\"#empiricism\">**</a></li>\r\n<li><b>Qualitative vs Quantitative.</b> Did they make measurements? Did they model the data? Did they use standard units?</li>\r\n<li><b>Holism vs Reductionism.</b> Did they analyse things into their constituent features? Did they explain phenomena in terms of ?</li>\r\n<li><b>Infallibilism vs Fallibilism.</b> Did they allow for the possibility of error? Did they view uncertain knowledge as still worthwhile? <a href=\"#fallibilism\">***</a></li>\r\n****\r\n</ul>^\r\n\r\nSo I'm modelling science as naturalist, fallibilist, quantitative empiricism with pretensions to openness. I've categorised the early scientists mentioned in <i>Curiosity</i> according to this: you can see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Bw1pqa-ZcGza9P3jV7wht8o9-xEJw0A0GpdN733MqE/edit?usp=sharing\">the data with additional justifications here</a>. (Ball doesn't state this model, but it floats around in his debunkings and \"well actually\"s.)\r\n\r\nAll of the pieces of science are very ancient - we had mathematics and data collection <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322\">well before the Ten Commandments</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus\">naturalism</a> before Buddha and Confucius, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism#Greek_atomism\">reductionism</a> before the Peloponnesian War at least <a href=\"http://tunesforbears.com/a-history-of-randomization/\">one controlled trial</a> centuries before Christ, <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/carneades/#3\">fallibilism</a> likewise. Everything was ready BCE; we can see indirect evidence of this in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile\">astonishing</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_screw\">works</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesibius#Inventions\">of</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byzantium#Devices\">Ancient Greek</a> engineers, mostly unmatched for 1000 years until y'know. \r\n\r\nSo the question is not \"was Bacon the most original blah blah?\": he wasn't, particularly when you remember Alhazen's Baconian method, developed in the C11th. But we need an explanation for how we messed it up so badly. The received view, which is all I have at the moment, is that the fall of Rome, Christian anti-intellectualism and, later, the enshrining of Aristotelian mistakes was enough to destroy and suppress the ideas. I want deeper explanations though. (For instance, what did we do to the economy?)\r\n\r\nA fun regression on this data would be to see how my scienciness measure correlates with the importance of the person's work. It would not be that highly proportional, in this time period. \r\n\r\n\r\n***************************************************************\r\n\r\nBack to the book eh! Book structure is lots of little chapters on fairly disjointed topics: early modern ideas of space travel, universal language, pumps, etc. Chapter on \"cabinets of curiosity\" is great though: suddenly their dull zany blare makes sense and I want to build one:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>this was more than a case of 'look what I've got'. The power with which </i>Wunderkammern<i> were imbued was... in that they created their own complete microcosm: a representation of the world in miniature... By possessing this microcosm the collector-prince was not just symbolising but also in a sense </i>exercising<i> his mastery of the world. The cabinet acted as a kind of mental laboratory within which the relationships between things could be contemplated via a process that shared elements of both experimentation and Gnostic revelation.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nBall doesn't like us calling the Scientific Revolution a revolution, and I agree: the revolution didn't consist in the theories of Bacon or Newton: it consists in the diffusion of the worldview into all subjects and all inquiry. It transformed society and gave us marvels, but it hasn't finished happening. The general will, or default state, is still strongly unscientific. (The largest and most grievous holdout, larger even than the enduring hold of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fideism\">fideist</a> religion, is our tribal politics and our largely nonempirical government policy.)\r\n\r\nBall expends a lot of time on a history of wonder vs curiosity vs dispassionate robot inquiry. People hated all of these things for various reasons, up until the Renaissance when curiosity became acceptable on what are now <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_skies_research\">classic economic grounds</a>, or in line with the Italian cult of the virtuoso - someone who's so bloody brilliant that you have to just let him get on with it.\r\n\r\nI always like Ball's drawling prose and catty editorialising. (For instance, Margaret Cavendish - the darling of arts academics who latch on to the only woman in sight in this period - gets a round dissing by Ball, as an anti-experiment idiot, a vitalist, and a misogynist.) Stimulating as always.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Bacon has some claim to being the most influential philosopher ever, in terms of counterfactual effect on history. (Rather than number of bloody citations!) No-one with his social standing was resisting the Aristotelian consensus in 1620; his prototype scientific method is a century ahead of its time. (Yes, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham#Scientific_method\">ibn al-Haytham</a>'s was 7 centuries ahead of its time, but to limited avail.)<a href=\"#people\">⏎</a>\r\n<a name=\"empiricism\"></a> \r\n\r\n** This one is hard to refer to, because we now find it incredibly easy to understand why \"go and look\" works as a general route to knowledge; Medieval thought rejected this on the basis of things like the problem of induction. \r\n\r\nThe cliched way to refer to the split between those who want to <i>start</i> with the apriori and those who want to start with data is \"Rationalism\" vs \"Empiricism\". But these words <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/27/why-i-am-not-rene-descartes/\">confuse people</a>: the two of them are also used in a C17th debate about psychology, to do with the nature of mental content. \r\n\r\nMore: it can't be a dichotomy, since many of the greatest rationalists (Descartes, Leibniz) were experimentalists too, doing what we now call empirical work. Three meanings of rationalism, and three words for them:\r\n<ul><li>'Rationalism<sub>1</sub>': Belief in innate ideas. Call it 'Continental Rationalism'. Descartes and Leibniz but not Dawkins and Shermer.</li>\r\n<li>'Rationalism<sub>2</sub>': Belief in the supremacy of apriori knowledge over empirical knowledge. Call it 'apriorism'. Aristotle was apriorist, as was Descartes.</li>\r\n<li>'Rationalism<sub>3</sub>': Belief that everything should be subject to reason and evidence. Includes Descartes and Leibniz <i>and</i> Dawkins and Shermer. Contemporary rationalists are highly if not radically empiricist.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\nI use <a href=\"https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2011/07/leibniz-experimental-philosopher/\">Alberto Vanzo</a>'s criteria for deciding if someone was enough of an experimentalist:\r\n<blockquote><blockquote><i> let us consider four typical features of early modern experimental philosophers:\r\n\r\n    <ul><li></i>self-descriptions<i>: experimental philosophers typically called themselves such. At the very least, they professed their sympathy towards experimental philosophy.</li>\r\n   <li></i>friends and foes<i>: experimental philosophers saw themselves as part of a tradition whose “patriarch” was Bacon and whose sworn enemy was Cartesian natural philosophy.</li>\r\n    <li></i>method<i>: experimental philosophers put forward a two-stage model of natural philosophical inquiry: first, collect data by means of experiments and observations; second, build theories on the basis of them. In general, experimental philosophers emphasized the a posteriori origins of our knowledge of nature and they were wary of a priori reasonings.</li>\r\n    <li></i>rhetoric<i>: in the jargon of experimental philosophers, the terms “experiments” and “observations” are good, “hypotheses” and “speculations” are bad. They were often described as fictions, romances, or castles in the air.</i></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote></blockquote>\r\nThis is unusually inclusive: the famous Rationalist Leibniz counts as experimental under this rubric. But a stronger definition of aposteriorist - like \"refuses to use purely analytic reasoning\", or even \"spent most of their time running experiments and analysing data\" would exclude many contemporary scientists. Sticking with Vanzo for now.  <a href=\"#model\">⏎</a>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"fallibilism\"></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Hard to imagine a fallibilist apriorist: perhaps Lakatos. (Some say Leibniz was, in practice.) I actually have met a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism_(philosophy)\">methodist</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_skepticism\">infallibilist apriorist</a>, but I won't meet another.  <a href=\"#model\">⏎</a>\r\n<a name=\"openness\"></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n**** I had included \"openness\" in the model -\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Obscurantism vs Openness.</b> Did they write in the vernacular? Did they publish for a wide readership? Did they spurn Noble Lies? Did they encourage replications with and data sharing? Did they build scholarly networks?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n- but I admit this is just wishful/normative thinking: modern academic science fails at this. Whether with its low-status replications, unreadable prose, paywalls on most research (tax-funded or no), pathetically low levels of data sharing, or the <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2015-cofnas.pdf\">prevalence of noble lies</a>... But it's definitely a core <i>aspiration</i> now: the greedy impulse behind hermeticism is blatantly unscientific, if not actually shunned by actual scientists. First, lip service...  \r\n\r\nThings can be science without being published, obviously: consider the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#History\">invention of public key cryptography</a> by a GCHQ wonk, classified for 25 years - or even the secret <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading#Low-latency_strategies\">infrastructure</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading#Statistical_arbitrage\">algorithmics</a> of high-frequency trading.\r\n\r\n^ Obviously these five factors aren't the end of the matter either. But I reckon it catches a decent amount of the variance in the term \"scientist\". Others e.g.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Particularism vs Consilience. Did they believe that the scientific method could explain every phenomenon?</li>\r\n<li>Realism vs Instrumentalism. Most scientists are realists about best current theories</li>\r\n<li>Theism vs Nontheism</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI <i>had</i> included non-theism in the core of modern science - and so it is, in the form of strong naturalism. Scient<i>ists</i>, on the other hand, differ from this, globally. This is partially because humans are so compartmentalised and can hold severe contradictions indefinitely. But, clearly, atheism is not an essential part of the modern method. But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_closure\">causal closure</a> and (at most) a <i>private</i> faith are.",

These mere genres are electrified by Murdoch's ethics and filled up with her wit. Like Greene, she is the apotheosis of trash conventions. I feel I am a better person afterward, or at least a better fool. The following derives its power from 200 pages of buildup suddenly letting loose, but it might give you an idea:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>Jealousy is the most natural to us of the really wicked passions... It must be resisted with every honest cunning and with deliberate generous thoughts, however abstract and empty these may seem in comparison with that wicked strength. Think about the virtue that you need and call it generosity, magnanimity, charity. You are young, Jessica, and you are very delightful – may I just take your hand, so? – and the world is not spoilt for you yet. There is no merit, Jessica, in a faithfulness which is poison to you and captivity to him. You have nothing to gain here except by losing. You wish to act out your love, to give it body, but there is only one act left to you that is truly loving and that is to let him go, gently and without resentment.\r\nPut all your, energy into that and you will win from the world of the spirit a grace which you cannot now even dream of. For there is grace, Jessica, there are principalities and powers, there is unknown good which flies magnetically toward the good we know. And suppose that you had found what you were looking for, my dear child? Would you not have been led on from jealousy through deceit into cruelty? Human frailty forms a system, Jessica, and faults in the past have their endlessly spreading network of results. We are not good people, Jessica, and we shall always be involved in that great network, you and I. All we can do is constantly to notice when we begin to act badly, to check ourselves, to go back, to coax our weakness and inspire our strength, to call upon the names of virtues of which we know perhaps only the names. We are not good people, and the best we can hope for is to be gentle, to forgive each other and to forgive the past...</i></blockquote>\r\nAn essay on the benefits and limits of polyamory; on the trials of self-conscious virtue; an extended gag about virtue's unlikeability. I love the appalling drawling fops Octavian and Kate, I love the notably indistinct Fivey, and I clutch Ducane to myself like a home-knitted scarf against strong winter wind. So pure!",

    "review": "One of the best biographies I've ever read. (The subtitle says it is about Ramanujan, but it is equally about Hardy, that perfect British intellect: more crystalline than Russell, more lofty than Moore, more self-critical than Hare, more fun than anyone, loveable atop it all.) Ramanujan's story is of course maximally moving to anyone with a shred of curiosity or pity. The most moving part of all is an absence, one of the darker thoughts among all thoughts: \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>How many Ramanujans, his life begs us to ask, dwell in India today, unknown and unrecognized? And how many in America and Britain, locked away in racial or economic ghettos, scarcely aware of worlds outside their own?</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nHis research is patent throughout: he decodes South Indian religion and cuisine, British upper-class slang, and even something of the impressiveness of higher mathematics, while using mere natural language:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>Ramanujan's work grants direct pleasure to only a few - a few hundred mathematicians and physicists around the world, perhaps a few thousand. The rest of us must either sit on the sidelines, and, on the authority of the cognoscenti, cheer - or else rely on vague, metaphoric, and necessarily imprecise glimpses of his work.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>...mathematics is not best learned passively; you don’t sop it up like a romance novel. You’ve got to go out to it, aggressive, and alert, like a chess master pursuing checkmate.</i></blockquote>\r\nRamanujan himself left a tiny dense literature that we are still decoding:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>Ramanujan's notebooks formed a distinctly idiosyncratic record. In them even widely standardized terms sometimes acquired new meaning. Thus, an \"example\" — normally, as in everyday usage, an illustration of a general principle — was for Ramanujan often a wholly new theorem. A \"corollary\" — a theorem flowing naturally from another theorem and so requiring no separate proof — was for him sometimes a generalization, which did require its own proof. As for his mathematical notation, it sometimes bore scant resemblance to anyone else's.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nMany passages raise goosebumps: Kanigel unites the abstract and the bodily, the true and the human all-too-human.\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>You cannot say much about Ramanujan without resorting to the word </i>self<i>. He was self-willed, self-directed, self-made. Some might conceivably label him selfish for his preoccupation with doing the mathematics he loved without any great concern for the better of his family or his country...\r\n\r\nHardy discovered Ramanujan? Not at all: a glance at the facts of 1912 shows that Ramanujan discovered Hardy.</i></blockquote>\r\nA life-giving book.",

    "review": "Remarkable book, mining Marxism’s great SF potential at last. Deeply politically incorrect somehow. I skipped Macleod until now, assuming that I already had the Scottish radical SF angle from Banks. But this is completely different. It’s detailed and tragic and filled with left self-sabotage. Clearly written by someone who has spent one too many evenings in vitriolic, pedantic, and useless Organising meetings.\r\n<blockquote><i>Stone hauled a tattered tabloid from the inside of his jacket and spread it on the table.\r\n‘Red Star,’ Stone said. ‘It’s a bit extreme, but some of the things they say make sense. Thought you might be interested, Moh.’\r\nDoes it show? Kohn wondered wildly. Is there some mark of Cain branded on my forehead that identifies me to everybody else, no matter what I say or don’t say, no matter how much I want to put it all behind me? He picked the paper up reluctantly, took his shades off to read. There it was, the banner with the strange device: a hammer-and-sickle, facing the opposite way from the traditional Soviet one, with a ‘4’ over the hammer.\r\nHe didn’t read beyond the masthead.\r\n‘The only red stars I know about,’ he said, ‘are dead, off the main sequence, and consist mostly of faintly glowing gas.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhy Marxist fiction (and not Marxist politics)?: the grand conflicts, the frustrated utopian futurism, the sweat and blood, the technology-first view of history. And also a lot of literary potential in the dwarfed, self-defeating, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communist_parties_in_Nepal\">famously speciated</a> real-life cadres. Macleod includes aching details about British leftist culture - calling your parents by their first name, Levi jackets as some kind of statement, the pompous set phrases of resistance (\"<i>comrades, this is no accident</i>\"), the paranoid tint the whole world takes when history is your foe. I miss the sincerity and spurious clarity, the cussed, blessed obliviousness to which century it is.\r\n<blockquote><i>The lunchtime crowd was so noisy she no longer noticed it, nor the wall-covering black-and-white portraits of Lech Walesa and Nelson Mandela and Winston Churchill and Bobby Sands and Wei Jingshen and others to whose memory various factions had successively dedicated the place…\r\n\r\nOthers moved through the shadows of the trees around him and he recognized them, the old comrades, the dead on leave: John Ball in his rough robe, Winstanley building a hut in a clearing, Tom Paine slipping him a wink as he and Blake stepped over the sleeping Bunyan; Harvey and Jones, Eleanor Marx and Morris….</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20210114010028/https://c4ss.org/content/13053\">The foreword</a> is essential reading - KM reveals himself to be a rare bird, a leftist who understands the dreadful force of Mises’ calculation argument.\r\n<blockquote><i>Unfortunately, there’s no reason why the Economic Calculation Argument and the Materialist Conception of History couldn’t both be true. What if capitalism is unstable, and socialism is impossible? </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAs a result, the main conflict in this is not socialism vs capitalism (the ancap zone is the nicest place in the book) but progress vs primitivism and resistance vs (American and UN) empire\r\n<blockquote><i>There were times when Kohn loathed the Left, when some monstrous stupidity almost, but never quite, outweighed the viciousness and venality of the system they opposed. Ally with the barbarians against the patricians and praetorians… think again, proletarians!… His co-op had lived by defending what he still saw as the seeds of progress – the workers’ organizations and the scientists and, if necessary, the capitalists – against the enemies of that modern industry on which all their conflicting hopes relied…\r\n\r\n(She’d often wondered just what molecule or compound was responsible for hysteria and ineducability in the middle classes: it must have seeped into the food-chain sometime in the nineteen-sixties, and become ever more concentrated since.)\r\n\r\n‘Fuck them and their nazi economics.’ He punched his palm. ‘Protection. Conservation. Restriction. Deep ecology. Give me deep technology any day. They don’t scare me. I’m damned if I’ll crawl, my children’s children crawl on the earth in some kind a fuckin harmony with the environment.\r\n\r\n…a permanent party – in both senses, an occasion and an organization of the privileged</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe OTT cynicism about the UN here contrasts well with the soppy treatment of the last fictional UN I encountered (Ada Palmer’s wise ancient saviour order).\r\n\r\nThe antagonists are done well. They're actually fighting to prevent billions of people dying, and their plan is <spoiler>actually the exact same as the one executed by The Gun deus ex machina. They also have some sense of AI x-risk, unlike the happy go lucky protagonists.</spoiler>\r\n\r\nThe AI stuff is good, and the antagonists are suitably scared of it. <spoiler>The expert system architecture is quaint but he did his best. The death of the AI civilisation, billions of apparently sentient and highly enhanced minds is not treated very seriously, not half as seriously as losing Moh alone. But I suppose they are easier to redo than humans.</spoiler>\r\nYep:\r\n<blockquote><i> the whole [AI] rumour was so apocalyptic that she had difficulty crediting it could really happen in her own lifetime. She knew this was exactly how people would feel just before the real apocalypse, that nearly everyone who’d faced some intrusive threat to their everyday existence – war, revolution, genocide, purges, disaster – had faced it with the firm conviction that things like this just didn’t happen or didn’t happen here or didn’t happen to people like them. But she also knew there would be no end of false alarms, lying wonders, false prophets with a Lo! here and a Hi! there, before whatever the real thing was came along. Indeed, they were part of the reason why the real thing always came like a thief in the night or… like a secret policeman in the early hours of the morning.</i> </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere are limits to Macleod’s scepticism. Trotsky looms large here as a wise prophet (never mind his own peasant-murdering and purely opportunistic democratic pivot).\r\n<blockquote><i>‘I can see the bright green strip of grass beneath the wall, and a clear blue sky above the wall, and sunlight everywhere. Life is beautiful. Let the future generations cleanse it of all evil, oppression and violence, and enjoy it to the full.’\r\nThe gentle words, harshly spoken in a polyglot accent, made Kohn’s eyes sting.\r\n‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘We haven’t done very well.’\r\nThe Old Man laughed. ‘You are not the future! You – you are only the present.’</i></blockquote>\r\n<spoiler>And the revolution wins, brutal and repressive as it instantly becomes.</spoiler>\r\n\r\nAlso notable for a negative portrayal of Archipelago, voluntary ideological nations with exit rights. The only real critique is that they war on each other all the time (millions of deaths a year), and indoctrinate their subjects so that people don’t exercise their exit rights. Looking at real-life migration patterns in the face of violent borders, few authoritarian regimes have so far managed to indoctrinate so successfully.\r\n<blockquote><i> New Situationists, Alternative Luddites (they wore space-rigger gear and blew up wind-power plants), Christianarchists, cranks, creeps, commies, tories – all had had their say, in colour.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nMacleod is aware that the themes in this 1995 book aged badly in the next decades - revolution lost its hold even among radicals, American hegemony beclowned itself, and the greens took over the left.\r\n<blockquote><i>And closer to hand, nearer than infinity, she could see the other free wheels turn. Stars and stripes and hammers and sickles flaunted their fading colours to the real stars that held no promises, only hopes and endless, endless lands. </i></blockquote>\r\nMore mind candy than Grand Synthesis, but a strong first novel anyway.",

    "review": "The Disc grew modern, gaining a media (<i>The Truth</i>), sanitation (also <i>The Truth</i>), soft-power politics (<i>Jingo!</i>, <i>Thud!</i>), and institutionalised sport (<i>Unseen Academicals</i>), to add to its latter-day civilian police (<i>Men at Arms</i>), telecoms (<i>Fifth Elephant</i>, and steam power (<i>Raising Steam</i>). \r\n\r\nThe most literary thing about the Discworld books is this modernisation, from magic to steampunk. This happens comically rapidly – <i>Colour of Magic</i>, the first book, is standard non-chronistic High Fantasy, so, set circa circa 1200CE. <i>Snuff</i> takes place not twenty-five discursive years later – yet the central city is clearly Victorian. And that’s not including the burgeoning <a href=\"http://discworld.wikia.com/wiki/Clacks\">intercontinental fax network</a>. \r\n\r\nTechnology is given its due, but not to the neglect of the institutional side. Disc modernity began with the despot Vetinari’s marketisation of crime, moves through ethnic diversity reforms and open-door immigration, and marches on and on. <i>UA</i>, the sport one, is solid, poignant. He doesn’t often let his wizards get earnest and truly develop – by this stage, magic is comic relief, no longer the determining power or symbol of the Disc. \r\n\r\n<i>Snuff</i> is dark and politically worthy, but not his best. He’s been reusing jokes in recent books, and I refuse to speculate on the cause. \r\n",

    "review": "Not a sequel: the third act of the first book. A strange mix of very clever and kind of ridiculous. The camp Gothic tone intensifies, piling mystery on the mystical, but eventually resolves in an unexpectedly rosy and metaphysical cadence. But you have to get through 450 pages of sand, impalings, twists, people writing poetry furiously as a walking knife guts them, etc. I'm not sure if it was worth it, but it certainly was Grand.\r\n\r\nRidiculous and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws#Variants_of_the_third_law\">Clarke-magic</a>-based sci-fi like <i>Dune</i>, grim and spiked like <i>Blindsight</i> (though turned completely upside down at the end: Watts is a deadly serious treatment of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomenalism\">epiphenomenalism</a> and illusionism; Simmons' universe is extremely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism\">idealist</a>/<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism\">dualist</a>), maybe the most extreme I've seen outside of medieval Christians or the hippies.)\r\n\r\nQuestions which get answered, usually 500 pages in:\r\n* Why is the Shrike such an inefficient avenger?\r\n* Why is John Keats being foregrounded 900 years later as a paragon of humanity? By robots?\r\n* Why are deep ecologists so keen on space?\r\n* What's so bad about the Hegemony?\r\n* Why is there literally no detail about the Ousters?\r\n* Why does Severn keep napping a dozen times a day? (Maybe it's the TB.)\r\n* Why make a copy of Earth? Why preserve it empty?\r\n\r\n<spoiler>A reconstructed cyborg Keats is the embodiment of the Human Spirit, able to affect the world (and the plot) as a ghost.</spoiler>\r\n\r\nIts appetite for mysticism is surprising. The only super-AI shown in any real detail speaks in koans, and is not especially impressive.\r\n<spoiler>The people who triumph in the end are odd: it's the deep ecologists and kibbutzim and Catholics - the ancient, normalised death cults - who thrive when modernity is withdrawn. The Ousters (and Simmons) equivocate between the Core plotting to murder everyone alive and the Core making everyone too comfortable to innovate and explore space. Which are not really morally equivalent when you think about it.\r\n\r\nThis is especially odd since the rest of the ending extols our creativity and scepticism and courage, i.e. the Enlightenment.\r\n</spoiler>\r\n\r\nThe ending is both too neat - all the loose ends tied up, several revivals, the baddies gone without a fight, the missing element in the Grand Unified Theory is the Human Spirit - and surprisingly harsh <spoiler>all the millions dead, and the saviour who rightly killed them torn apart by the mob</spoiler>.\r\n\r\nToo long and slow to recommend to everyone, but rich and novel for people who can get past that.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHow does it do as Serious science fiction?\r\n\r\n<i>Social development</i>: Some, this time. The Ousters are eventually shown as rad anarchists with wings and stuff.\r\n\r\n<i>Software development</i>: No.\r\n\r\n<i>Actual Science</i>: Not really.\r\n",

    "review": "Diaries in the lee of becoming actually famous. I love him dearly and bolted all 700pp in a couple of days. General sense of him reaping decades of quiet acclaim: he bumps into well-wishers and heavy-hitters (Stoppard, Dench, MacKellen) every week or so. \n\nOne of the reasons I love him is that I had a very similar adolescence to his. He remains reserved, kind though grumpy:\n<blockquote><i>Being in love unhappily singled you out, I thought, it drafted you into an aristocracy. It was more than just a badge of being gay but rather an ordeal you were called upon to undergo if only to transcend it and reach a sublimity denied to other mortals.\n\n\nIn the evening to the New York Public Library where I am to be made a Library Lion... There are half a dozen of us being lionised and we are lined up and photographed and made much of before going upstairs to a magnificent supper, getting home thoroughly knackered around 11. How people lead a social life is beyond me.\n\n\nI clung far too long to the notion that shyness was a virtue and not, as I came too late to see, a bore.</i></blockquote>\nHe still feels outside of things, for all his reminiscences of dinner with Harold Wilson or Liz Taylor perching on his knee. On winning a Tony for Best Play aged 72:\n <blockquote><i>I am thrust blinking on to a stage facing a battery of lights while questions come out of the darkness, the best of which is: ‘Do you think this award will kick-start your career?'</i></blockquote>\nTalks so much about 50s Yorkshire. (People in general seem to think about their childhoods more than I do. (or just writers?)) I suppose he is taken to be a twee writer for this nostalgia, along with his cuddly speaking voice. But he simply isn't twee - he is the author of several of the finest nihilist soliloquoys in English literature. You may know the ignorance of people by their use of this stereotype.\n\nHe is touchingly agitated by British politics, in the exact way I used to be. His protests are unprogrammatic, based simply on the meanness or indignity or cowardice of the policy at hand, whether it's a Labour or Tory hand;\n<blockquote><i>\nI wanted a Labour government so that I could stop thinking about politics, knowing that the nation’s affairs were in the hands of a party which, even if it was often foolish, was at least well-intentioned. Now we have another decade of the self-interested and the self-seeking, ready to sell off what’s left of our liberal institutions and loot the rest to their own advantage. It’s not a government of the nation but a government of half the nation, a true legacy of Mrs Thatcher...\n\nI’ve always thought that this was a pretty fair description of that blend of backward-looking radicalism and conservative socialism which does duty for my political views. I am an old modernian... [Over the past 30 years] one has only had to stand still to become a radical.</i></blockquote>\nWith the fading of the old loud left, and the abject failure of the sneering theoretical sort, unpretentious justice of this sort might motivate people, even/especially opportunist Brexiters. So to the defence of public libraries, the unprecedented conviction of policemen who murder, the provision of good to all. \n\n[<a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Data #1, Values #3, Thinking #3</a>]",

Gross has given me tender feelings for a hundred dead people, and what is one to do with those, except what I'm doing right now?\r\n\r\nGreat essays share something. These essayists wouldn't all agree on anything, I'm sure. But there's something about their voices: personal, rational, intimate, concise, forceful. The essay is in the process of being superceded by the article and the blogpost, but we shouldn't judge those two forms by the dross we are all seeing from day to day; surely most essays were also petty and inelegant. \r\n\r\nJust one example: I bear quite a lot of ill-will toward Churchill; but <a href=\"http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Miscellaneous/Other/Churchill/Dream/p01.html\">his entry here</a> is just incredibly beautiful; a hallucinatory conversation with his dead father, with junior struggling to bridge the violent gap the last two generations made in culture and history. I would not have believed him so self-aware: \r\n\r\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Khq-rDwIxkI/WWAAris-yZI/AAAAAAAADAs/XDlHAOCAUZ80ARt6WeSg2MrmchAMF0xDgCLcBGAs/s1600/1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Khq-rDwIxkI/WWAAris-yZI/AAAAAAAADAs/XDlHAOCAUZ80ARt6WeSg2MrmchAMF0xDgCLcBGAs/s400/1.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"260\" data-original-width=\"510\" data-original-height=\"331\" /></a></div>\r\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vm_pAEGIog8/WWAA3xSQU6I/AAAAAAAADAw/1mAaD6HI3EYy2w-SU39dtk6iR-aXI76DQCLcBGAs/s1600/1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vm_pAEGIog8/WWAA3xSQU6I/AAAAAAAADAw/1mAaD6HI3EYy2w-SU39dtk6iR-aXI76DQCLcBGAs/s400/1.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"72\" data-original-width=\"484\" data-original-height=\"87\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\nI also find myself nodding in agreement with the likes of Cardinal Newman and Makepeace Thackaray.

    "review": "Such an insultingly dumb plot - \"the Nazis act as they do because they are all on crystal meth\" - except it's nonfiction and quite plausible. The 70-hour assaults of Blitzkrieg in particular could not have happened without heavy stimulants. And Hitler becomes much more understandable when you learn of his ten year binge on injected pharmaceuticals. \n\nJuicy bits:\n<blockquote>[Around 1923] <i>forty per cent of Berlin doctors were said to be addicted to morphine</i>\n\nTelling propaganda: ‘[Hitler] <i>mortifies his body in a way that would shock people like us! He doesn’t drink, he practically only eats vegetables, and he doesn’t touch women.’ Hitler allegedly didn’t even allow himself coffee and legend had it that after the First World War he threw his last pack of cigarettes into the Danube near Linz; from then onwards, supposedly, no poisons would enter his body.\n\n</i>Telling propaganda: <i>‘For decades our people have been told by Marxists and Jews: “Your body belongs to you.” That was taken to mean that at social occasions between men, or between men and women, any quantities of alcohol could be enjoyed, even at the cost of the body’s health. Irreconcilable with this Jewish Marxist view is the Teutonic German idea that we are the bearers of the eternal legacy of our ancestors, and that accordingly our body belongs to the clan and the people.’\n\nChocolates spiked with methamphetamine were even put on the market. A good 14 milligrams of methamphetamine was included in each individual choc – almost five times the amount in a [prescription] pill.</i></blockquote>\nOhler argues that drugs have been overlooked as the (unsustainable) engine of the Nazi economic recovery, and of the alien intensity of the ideology, because people took Goebbels at his word about the Nazi drive for natural organic wellness and purity and so ignored this 'medicine' that millions of Germans were supplied by the state and IG. I don't know whether Ohler is making a revisionist stretch or not, but certainly Pervitin had a role.\n",

    "review": "The third PhD I have ever read, the first to which I've contributed, and certainly the best-written. ”The \"Adam Smith Problem\" is just that Smith's two big books seem to dramatically contradict each other: <a href=\"http://econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html\"><i>WoN</i></a> is methodologically and normatively individualist and abstracts out the economy from the rest of human life, but <a href=\"http://econlib.org/library/Smith/smMS0.html\"><i>ToMS</i></a> is a holistic and altruistic picture, one which subsumes economic behaviour as a special case of all virtuous or vicious actions. Hodder's job, which, remarkably, went undone over 200 years of scholarly debate, is to consider the possible explanations (e.g. \"Smith divides society into disjoint private and public spheres\"; \"one of the two books is ironic\"; \"he changed his mind\"; \"he was a idjit\") through close exegesis and logical reconstruction, and somehow weigh them.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is satisfying enough: <i>What is the Adam Smith Problem?: A debate on a problem; the debate was the problem</i>. Basically, a series of bad readers (from the German Historicists to Paul Samuelson) misread certain key terms and passages, imputed an anachronistic atheism and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes#Agent\">efficient-causation</a> empiricism to him, and then propagated a straw-man (\"a <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/226156/pdf\">shadow history</a>\") throughout the secondary literature and the tertiary sewer we call the media. (They also missed the timing and the explicit initial audience of <i>WoN</i>: the book is avowedly a polemic to affect British trade policy, and a highly successful one at that.)\r\n\r\nHodder writes with absolutely minimal jargon; this is as easily grasped as C18th political economy can be. One of my notes was that an institutionalised marker might penalise it for omitting jargon to the degree it does; after all, what's the point if just anyone can waltz in to constructive thought without using the gaudy tools made in desperation by knowledge pieceworkers?:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>Sympathy plays a far more foundational role in </i>WN<i> than has previously been noted by any scholar which I have encountered. If we return to the butcher, brewer and baker, example, where we address ourselves not to their benevolence but to their self-interest, all commentators seem to have overlooked the question of how we are to go about addressing ourselves to another's self-interest. The obvious and simple answer to this is Sympathy. We put ourselves in their place, we realise that they expect to be paid for their labour as we would expect to be paid for our own, and as a result we understand that the appropriate behaviour expected of us is to pay for their service. In the primitive society, where the hunter begins to trade his bows for food and starts down the long road towards commercial society, it must be Sympathy which alerts his fellow hunters that he wants something in return for the bows he produces. “Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want” requires that I can escape my own self-interest and understand what you want, and have at least a basic level of Sympathy for you otherwise I would not know what to offer you.\r\n\r\nSympathy must therefore apply to trade at a very foundational level, and that intimate Sympathy which fosters benevolence can take hold even in business relationships. All it requires is repeated dealings with the same person, and a character which is “well-disposed”. It is not said to be central to society - but this is entirely consistent with </i>TMS<i>, where Smith describes benevolence as “the ornament that embellishes” society, that which makes it happier rather than merely efficient.</i></blockquote>\r\nI do wonder at the fact that someone with no historiographical background and only half an economics degree could make substantive corrections and suggestions at the very frontier of the field's knowledge of <i>a canonical figure</i>. In one way this is nice: reason is a universal solvent, and specific facts make up relatively little of total intellectual work! But in another way sad: the pompousness and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary-work\">boundary-work</a> of the non-formal academic fields is again shown to be needless, and narrowing.",

    "review": "Anecdotal evidence of the new culture, which is both orchestrated and predated upon by an amoral mafia state. \r\n\r\nPostmodern dictatorship unnerves me more than the clumsy fascism of the Ba'ath or Juche. It's one thing to steal almost everything from your people; one thing to demean, torture and murder millions; one thing to employ a large fraction of the entire country as rabid unaccountable secret police. Even if you do all of this, your people still know you're evil and long for your death. It says something about me that the perversion of meaning, the co-optation of language, and erasing the possibility of objectivity is more emotionally taxing than straightforward torture kleptocracy (\"<i>say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude...</i>\").\r\n\r\nThe most appalling figure in Pomerantsev's long list is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Surkov\">Vladislav Surkov</a>. He is at first hard to credit as real: think Russell Brand crossed with Don Draper crossed with Laurentii Beria. His exploits sound like totally mental conspiracy theories, but are actually(?) open secrets:\r\n<blockquote><i>... the office of the presidential administration, where Surkov would sit behind a desk with phones bearing the names of all the “independent” party leaders, calling and directing them at any moment, day or night. The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, rendering them absurd. One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions...</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe book is <i>all</i> anecdote. He does state some statistics, but without sourcing; the book has no footnotes. We need to do better than this, what with the Kremlin's online troll army. It is journalism, then, not social theory: a picture of a hundred or so people. Russia is so skewed that one can capture some important things about by focussing on the ultra-powerful: Berezovsky and Putin, Surkov and Deripaska. \r\n\r\nPomerantsev views the \"international development consultants\" trying to improve matters as bumbling, ineffective ambassadors of our best side. \r\n\r\nHe's very glib in attributing daddy issues, as if psychology were that straightforward, as if Freud were that credible. His prose has the distracting, unbalanced sentences of indifferently translated work (\"<i>developers steal so much money during construction that even the most VIP, luxury, elite of the skyscrapers cracks and sink ever so quickly</i>\"; \"<i>out to make a few quick quid</i>\"). The drama of it all is wearing: he was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyshockers\">Channel 4-style</a> hack documentarian before becoming a respected literary insider. It is much the same as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p04b183c/adam-curtis-hypernormalisation\">Adam Curtis'</a> hyperactive, over-theorised view.\r\n\r\nBut this is still good, outraging and intelligent (e.g. he takes for granted that we will understand the contrast between Kaliningrad as the home of Kant <i>and</i> grand larceny and sleaze). A small salvo of authenticity against the Kremlin's apparent wall of disinformation and corruption.\r\n\r\nI wish I knew a better book on the same topic but it's new and behind a language barrier.",

Anyway half of the idiocy is forced on him by the genre, epic verse, which always sounds damn silly to me (not that I mind silliness in my high art, but I do mind people being silly and not admitting it):\n<blockquote>\n<i>Tonight a scrambling decade ends, \nAnd strangers, enemies and friends\nStand once more puzzled underneath\nThe signpost on the barren heath\nWhere the rough mountain track divides... \n\nA weary Asia out of sight \nIs tugging gently at the night, \nUncovering a restless race; \nClocks shoo the childhood from its face, \nAnd accurate machines begin \nTo concentrate its adults in \nA narrow day to exercise \nTheir gifts in some cramped enterprise. \nHow few pretend to like it: O, \nThree quarters of these people know \nInstinctively what ought to be \nThe nature of society \nAnd how they'd live there if they could. \nIf it were easy to be good, \nAnd cheap, and plain as evil, how \nWe all would be its members now... \n\nHow grandly would our virtues bloom \nIn a more conscionable dust \nWhere Freedom dwells because it must, \nNecessity because it can, \nAnd men confederate in Man.\n\nBut wishes are not horses, this \nAnnus is not mirabilis; \nDay breaks upon the world we know \nOf war and wastefulness and woe... \n\nThe New Year brings an earth afraid, \nDemocracy a ready-made \nAnd noisy tradesman's slogan, and \nThe poor betrayed into the hand \n\nOf lackeys with ideas, and truth\nWhipped by their elders out of youth, \nThe peaceful fainting in their tracks \nWith martyrs' tombstones on their backs, \nAnd culture on all fours to greet A butch and criminal elite, \nWhile in the vale of silly sheep \nRheumatic old patricians weep... \n</i></blockquote>\nOne critic, screwing up all his strength, called Auden's bad style, which <i>NYL</i> is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/12/poetry.whauden\">supposed to be</a> an instance of, \"snide bright jargon\", which is a perfect compliment!

    "review": "Begins very well:\n<blockquote>\n<i>\n'The Establishment' is a term that is often loosely used to mean \"people with power whom I object to\".\n</i></blockquote>\nBut this awareness didn't immunise him to self-service: instead of writing a book about just \"the people with power\", or \"people who abuse their power\", he focusses on one sort: the many cronies and neoliberals that cling to the country's upper reaches. The Jonesian Establishment consists of: fiscally conservative think tanks (but not powerful fiscally liberal ones); Old Boy MPs (but not originally working-class ones, however much they use the same revolving doors); the news media (but not himself, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OwenJones84?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">500,000</a> followers); the police; all corporate bosses; anything to do with the City. \n\nThis is only a problem because of his choice of term, which implies that his description covers all the powerful in Britain. (A big omission, for instance, are the unions. Unite and Unison have extremely <a href=\"https://www.lgcplus.com/prime-minister-restores-tuc-meetings/1501606.article\">frequent</a> meetings with the most powerful politicians in the country - quite rightly - and have an incredibly strong role in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/unite-union-boss-len-mccluskey-threatens-to-launch-party-to-rival-labour-9231266.html\">selecting some of those people</a> - quite dubiously. They sometimes use this power against the public interest, e.g. GMB propping up Trident. But they are not Establishment to Jones.*) \n\nHe is thinking clearly, and that's half the work in finding the truth, which is half the work in changing the world. But, above the level of reporting individual events, he is just not empirically reliable: he notes that the <i>Sun</i> has 3m readers and just assumes that this means they are all-powerful in elections. Actually the (British, C21st) media has <a href=\"http://www.city.ac.uk/news/2015/april/newspapers-influence-election\">little effect</a> on election outcomes - <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.570.64&rep=rep1&type=pdf\">they produce only</a> <a href=\"http://users.ox.ac.uk/~chri3110/Details/Sun%20paper.pdf\">1-2% swings</a>.**\n\nA more general problem: Jones has a fundamentally <i>moral</i> conception of society's problems: \"the poor primarily suffer because of the greed or cowardice or ignorance of our rulers. Nationalisations and the £20 minimum wage would have no real downside.\" This is as opposed to the engineering conception, which sees the constraints, tradeoffs, and tries to design solutions with these in mind.\n\nStill, my sympathies are with people who get attacked on both sides of a war, as Jones often does - for being both naively idealistic about economics and democracy, <i>and</i> insufficiently radical and obedient to the party line. He bears some millstones, like his totally unanalysed use of the Left/Right divide (he prefaces every single bloody interview with bloody anyone with a binary tag, one way or the other).\n\nAnyway this is fine as very recent political history. (If you were paying attention to politics during the Noughties, then you maybe won't learn much new here, but it's a great primer for the foreign or young.) I was angry afterward, so clearly he is effective at his chosen task; god knows if political anger is what we need though. (I read a <i>lot</i> of non-data-driven nonfiction, god knows why. Maybe so my anger can be relevant at least, or in preparation for pseuds' dinner parties.) \n\n\n\n* (I also wish he'd stop capitalising the damn word all the time.)\n\n** A belief in the brain-washing power of the media - to change voting behaviour, to instil sexism, to desensitize us to violence - is one of the defining quirks of the modern hard left, despite there being decent counter-evidence against each effect. <i>Percipi est esse.</i>\n",

Here is him describing <i>one</i> 6 month block of his youth: <blockquote><i>\r\nI ended up penniless and was pushed around from place to place for weeks until finally I was picked up on a country road by the Franklin family. The mother had six children between seventeen and twenty-seven, her husband had died and there was a ninety-three-year-old grandmother. I owe them so much, this wonderful, crazy family who put me up in an attic... Of course I needed to earn some money, so I started to work on a project that was part of a series of films for NASA. That I made films for NASA always appears on those five-line biographies, and even if it is somehow true, it is completely irrelevant. I did have access to certain restricted areas and was able to talk to many of the scientists, but just before I was about to start work on the film they ran a security check...\r\n\r\nIt was evident I was about to be expelled from the country... so I took a rusty old Volkswagen and went to New York during a very bitter winter. I lived in the car for some time, even though its floor as rusted right through and I had a cast on my leg at the time because I had broken it quite badly after jumping out of a window... at night, when it gets cold, say at 3 or 4 a.m., the homeless of New York - who live almost like Neanderthal men - come and gather together on some empty, utterly desolate street and stand over fires they have kindled in the metal rubbish bins without speaking a word. Eventually I just cut the whole cast off with a pair of poultry shears and fled across the border into\r\nMexico.</i></blockquote>\r\nHis whole life is lived with this undemonstrative fervour.\r\n\r\nThe interviewer is completely uninspired: he just works his way stolidly through Herzog's back catalogue, with no insight into anything much (\"<i>Precautions Against Fanatics was your first colour film, a bizarre comedy set at a racetrack where various individuals feel it necessary to protect the animals from local 'fanatics'. Any comments?</i>\"); we are fortunate that Herzog is self-stimulating and full of himself. I'll just let him show you how good he is:\r\n<i><blockquote>\r\nI have never been one of those who cares about happiness. Happiness is a strange notion. I am just not made for it. It has never been a goal of mine; I do not think in those terms. It seems to be a goal\r\nin life for many people, but I have no goals in life. \r\n\r\nI am someone who takes everything very literally... I am like a Bavarian bullfrog just squatting there, brooding. I have never been capable of discussing art with people. I just cannot cope with irony. The French love to play with their words and to master French is to be a master of irony. Technically, I am able to speak the language - I know the words and verbs - but will do so only when I am really forced to.\r\n\r\nI was forbidden to use fireworks. I told the army major that it was essential for the film. 'You'll be arrested,' he said. 'Then arrest me,' I said, 'but know that I will not be unarmed tomorrow. And the first man who touches me will drop down dead with me.' The next day there were fifty policemen and soldiers standing watching me work, plus a few thousand people from the town who wanted to see the fireworks. Of course, I was not armed, but how were they to know? Nobody complained or said anything. So through all these incidents I learned very quickly that this was the very nature of filmmaking.</i></blockquote>\r\nEverything he makes is worth your time (even <i>Dinotasia</i> is so bad it's good).",

Plus a half for reusing Miller, a dead man, so well.\r\n\r\nThis passage was good (maybe need to be there though): what a genetic algorithm feels like from inside -<blockquote><i>\r\nIt builds the investigator, and the investigator looks, but does not know. It kills the investigator. It builds the investigator, and the investigator looks, but does not know. It kills the investigator. It builds the investigator, and the investigator looks but does not know, and it does not kill the investigator. It is not aware of a change, that a pattern has broken. The investigator is aware, and it wonders, and because it wonders it looks, and because it looks, the investigator exceeds its boundary conditions, and it kills the investigator.\r\nIt builds the investigator.\r\nSomething knows.\r\nThe investigator hesitates. A pattern has broken, and it isn’t aware that a pattern has broken, but a part of it is. A part of it grasps at the change and tries to tell the investigator. And the investigator stops. Its thoughts are careful as a man walking in a minefield. The investigator hesitates, knows a pattern has been broken. Breaks it a little more. The dead place becomes better defined. It reaches out, and it does not kill the investigator. The investigator exceeds its boundary conditions, and it does not kill the investigator. The investigator considers the dead space, the structure, the reaching out, the reaching out, the reaching out.\r\nThe investigator licks his lips, he doesn’t have a mouth. He adjusts his hat, he doesn’t have a hat. He wishes in a distant way that he had a beer, he has no body and no passion. He turns his attention to the dead space, to the world, to how you solve unsolvable problems. How you find things that aren’t there. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nAnd the <i>awww shiit</i> political implication rant at the end is very satisfying.\r\n\r\nWhat I like about this book is the small stakes - instead of the usual \"all the solar system FOREVERRR\" it's about the fate of 200 folk on a backwater.\r\n\r\nThe villain is interesting, implausible: a corporate bushidō deontologist, willing to die for his shareholders.

She makes up for the long-missing romanticism single-handed! The two-hundred year eclipse of the Bayesian method was much longer than that suffered by even the irrationally-maligned <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Continental_drift#/Rejection_of_Wegener.27s_theory.2C_1910s.E2.80.931950s\">continental drift</a> theory (50 years). And this neglect and opprobrium was suffered by a paradigm now accepted everywhere as powerful and useful in literally all kinds of research. \r\n\r\nShe wins us over, particularly with her chapter on the secretive, truculent, omnicompetent genius John Tukey, who used Bayesian methods for elections 40 years before <i><a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/\">Fivethirtyeight</a></i>, with comparable success. But her prose is borderline, with lots of clear but dim-bulb sentences. \r\n\r\nShe has one infuriating mannerism: she constantly refers to Bayes' rule, Bayesian logical foundations after Bayes, Bayesian inference, <i>and</i> personalist Bayesian epistemology by the single terrible metonym \"Bayes\": \r\n<blockquote><i>At its heart, Bayes runs counter to the deeply held conviction that science requires total objectivity and precision. Bayes is a measure of belief.\r\n\r\n...even many nonstatisticians regarded Swinburne's lack of care and measurement as a black mark against Bayes itself.\r\n\r\n...Bayes, on the other hand, seemed to produce results that corresponded more closely to sociologists' intuitions.\r\n\r\n...Wagner took along the youngest and greenest of his three-man staff, Henry Richardson, who had earned a PhD in probability theory all of seven months earlier. He would be Bayes' point man at Palomares.</i></blockquote>\r\nI suppose she did this to elide away jargon, but it both equivocates between very different entities, hides the complexity of the 'Bayesian' marquee, invites the idea that the frequentists were attacking a logically sound theorem, and produces a whole list of bizarre images, where we see the reclusive Reverend doing all these things: cracking Enigma and Tunny, finding H-Bombs lost at sea, calculating appropriate worker's comp amounts in the absence of reliable data, attributing <i>The Federalist Papers</i> to Hamilton, and blocking 99.9% of the spam email from reaching you (yes, you). \r\n\r\nIt is also even <i>more</i> unfair to Laplace than usual. (It was he who developed Bayesianism into the powerful applied framework it is, into more than a single gambler's theorem. Ok, so \"Laplace-Coxism\" is admittedly even less admissible as a term to which the wise and honest may repair.) \r\n\r\nGrammatical twitching aside this was a fun introduction to an important thing.\r\n\r\nShe focusses on the soft, social side (and on applications vaguely summarised). There was a huge amount of factional bitching between these serious and cloistered men:\r\n<blockquote><i>Attending his first Bayesian conference in 1976, Jim Berger was shocked to see half the room yelling at the other half. Everyone seemed to be good friends, but their priors were split between the personally subjective, like Savage's, and the objective, like Jeffrey's - with no definitive experiment to decide the issue.\r\nIn a frustrated circle of blame, Persi Diaconis was shocked and angry when John Pratt used frequentist methods to analyze his wife's movie theater attendance data, because it was too much for the era's computers to handle. But one of the low moments of Diaconis' life occurred in a Berkeley coffee shop, where he was correcting proofs of an article of his and where Lindley blamed him for using frequency methods. \"And you're our leading Bayesian\", Lindley complained. Lindley, in turn, upset Mosteller by passing up a chance to conduct a big project using Bayes instead of frequency...\r\nAsked how to encourage Bayesian theory, Lindley answered tartly, \"Attend funerals\".</i></blockquote>\r\nThis human focus means she gives no treatment of <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cox's_theorem\">Cox's theorem</a>, certainly the most remarkable result in formal epistemology (and probability theory?), and one of the main things which rationally warrants the partisanship and excitement she displays for Bayesian thought throughout. (\"<a href=\"http://biasandbelief.pbworks.com/w/page/6537213/References%20on%20the%20Cox%20Proof\">Justified fundamentalism</a>\", as one great commentator puts it!) It proves that any attempt to use numbers to model belief must be Bayesian or logically equivalent to it. With other results, it raises Bayesianism to the only viable quantitative theory of rationality and of right learning, a behemoth of which Aristotelian logic is a mere special case. No doubt I'm unusual in finding this the most exciting bit.\r\n\r\nShe's to be applauded for digging out novel examples of Bayesian analysis which were classified or which avoided using the word: early actuarial work, Tukey's US election model, the pre-Three-Mile-Island federal report of reactor safety, and the entire field of operational research. But she is so concerned with emphasising the (genuine) long oppression of the paradigm that she under-emphasises the good reasons to resist Bayesian methods before 1980: they were simply computationally intractable before MCMC. (Which makes the sheer effort put in to shortcuts and approximation methods by ingenious people quite tragic; they just aren't needed anymore, thirty years later.) To her credit, she does mention the parallel dogmatism of the 60s Bayesians and the presumptive overenthusiasm of some people in the last 10 years. \r\n\r\n(The great contemporary frequentist, Deborah Mayo, is able to subtitle her blog \"<a href=\"https://errorstatistics.com/about-2/\">Frequentists in Exile</a>\" without being absurd - even though Stats 101 and \"Methods for [Social Science]\" courses are still everywhere dominated by canned Fisherian tests and frames. She means exile from the philosophy of statistics and probability.)\r\n\r\nInsofar as you want to understand the large trends of the present and coming age, you need to know its economics; insofar as you must understand the new economics, you must understand AI; insofar as you must understand AI, you must understand machine learning and decision theory; insofar as you must understand machine learning, you must understand <a href=\"http://blog.shakirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bayes_Deep.pdf\">both frequentism and Bayesianism</a>. Insofar as you do not yet have the mathematics to understand Bayesianism, nor the excitement of the promise of a final, real synthesis of objective with subjective, you must read this gentle prose work. Once you are excited by its vague promises, you can find progressively more rigorous people and will have actually have reason to stomach the formalism.\r\n\r\n3/5, 4*/5 for those just beginning the march.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H2gE7COadso/V1LP1e71xYI/AAAAAAAACls/FoZwG_oIjEU_tR4rhYg6cuJ3jh-bCjYjgCLcB/s1600/b5c26f9b444a6805027e2f8cc18fd59d.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H2gE7COadso/V1LP1e71xYI/AAAAAAAACls/FoZwG_oIjEU_tR4rhYg6cuJ3jh-bCjYjgCLcB/s640/b5c26f9b444a6805027e2f8cc18fd59d.jpg\" /></a>(c) African Sonata (c.2000) by Vladimir Kush</div>",

That is, anthropology conducted by the opposite side of a total war, for predictive military purposes of the highest consequence. She was of course robbed of the moral superiority of field work by an ocean and a bunch of tanks and whatnot, so this is all based on expat interviews and extremely secondary sources. I'm still struggling to overcome my deep suspicion of cultural anthropology; thus I was actively drawn to Benedict by <a href=\"http://apjjf.org/-C.-Douglas-Lummis/2474/article.html\">this hatchet job</a>, by a modern relativist anthropologist. \r\n\r\nSadly the book's only ok, very nicely written but falsely general.

Even so, in the one truly essential passage, Benedict lays out (and later tries to ameliorate) a popular reified caricature of the Japanese: as morbid, conformist, and paradoxical:\r\n<blockquote><i>the Japanese have been described in the most fantastic series of ‘...but also's’ ever used for any nation of the world.  When a serious observer is writing about peoples other than the Japanese and says they are unprecedentedly polite, he is not likely to add, ‘But also insolent and overbearing.’ When he says people of some nation are incomparably rigid in their behaviour, he does not add, 'But they also adapt themselves readily to extreme innovations'. When he says a people are submissive, he does not explain too that they are not easily amenable to control from above... When he says they act mostly out of concern for others' opinions, he does not then go on to tell that they have a truly terrifying conscience...\r\n\r\nWhen he writes a book on a nation with a popular cult of aestheticism which gives high honor to actors and to artists and lavishes art upon the cultivation of chrysanthemums, that book does not ordinarily have to be supplemented by another which is devoted to the cult of the sword and the top prestige of the warrior... All these contradictions, however, are the warp and woof of books on Japan.  They are true.  Both the sword and the chrysanthemum are a part of the picture.  The Japanese are to the highest degree, both aggressive and unaggressive, both militaristic and aesthetic, both insolent and polite, rigid and adaptable, submissive and resentful of being pushed around, loyal and treacherous, brave and timid, conservative and hospitable to new ways.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nPeople say she made this worse, but you can't claim that she didn't know something was up with the Western concepts used. There's an intriguing suggestion that the book is actually a satire (Geertz: \"<i>The Chrysanthemum and the Sword is no more a prettied-up science-without-tears policy tract than [Gulliver's Travels] is a children's book.</i>\"). But she actually was attached to military intelligence at the time and actually interviewed Japanese-American internees, and I find I don't much care either way.\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>In one sentence</i>: The above long passage with a question mark on it.",

    "review": "\"<i>Being an Enquiry into the Interplay of Chance and Necessity in the Way That Human Culture, Customs, Institutions, Cooperation and Conflict Arise</i>\" (2004) by Philip Ball.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn elegant pop treatment of the once-burgeoning physics of mass human behaviour. (Which physics follows hundreds of years of stupid and/or inhumane theories claiming the name \"social physics\"). A love letter to statistical mechanics:\r\n<blockquote><i>Most people who have encountered thermodynamics blanch at its mention, because it is an awesomely tedious discipline both to learn theoretically and to investigate experimentally. This is a shame, because it is also one of the most astonishing theories in science. Think of it: here is a field of study initiated to help nineteenth-century engineers make better engines, and it turns out to produce some of the grandest and most fundamental statements about the way the entire universe works. Thermodynamics is the science of change, and without change there is nothing to be said...\r\n\r\nTools, methods and ideas developed to understand how the blind material fabric of the universe behaves are finding application in arenas for which they were never designed, and for which they might at first glance appear ridiculously inappropriate. Physics is finding its place in a science of society.</i></blockquote>\r\nIntroduces a hundred topics from thermodynamics, economics, econophysics, game theory, and fields which don't have a name yet, including intuitive explanations of fearsome concepts like: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>self-organized criticality</li><li>the 2D and 3D Ising model</li><li>diffusion-limited aggregation in bacteria and cities</li><li>Lévy-stability</li><li>the business cycle</li><li>random walks</li><li>superfluidity and supercooling phase transitions</li><li>bifurcation theory</li><li>traffic flow</li><li>Zipf's law</li><li>the Small world phenomenon</li><li>catastrophe theory</li>... \r\n</ul>\r\nUnlike shiny TED-style nonfiction, he refers directly to the original scientific papers and includes small interviews with the original researchers. No equations, but beautiful diagrams relating micro with macro, too: snowflakes to traffic and bacterial colonies to cities.\r\n\r\nThe book's reception, in the main by middlebrow, mathematically illiterate reviewers shocked me a bit: their banner conclusions were \"boo! people aren't particles!!\", a truism which Ball spends much of the book thinking about, and \"aaar horrible people have said they've found the laws of society before!!\", a truism the first fifth of the book is a history of. In their haste to protect ordinary human difference from averages, and the notion of free will from technical explanations, they flee to safe refuges like \"complexity\" and \"reflexivity\", i.e. out of science. Ball can speak for himself though:\r\n<blockquote><i>The notion that we could ever construct a scientific \"utopia theory\" </i>[e.g. classical Marxism] <i>is, then, doomed to absurdity. Certainly, a \"physics of society\" can provide nothing of the sort. One does not build an ideal world from scientifically based traffic planning, market analysis, criminology, network design, game theory, and the gamut of other ideas discussed in this book. Concepts and models drawn from physics are almost certainly going to find their way into other areas of social science, but they are not going to provide a comprehensive theory of society, nor are they going to make traditional sociology, economics, or political science redundant. The skill lies in deciding where a mechanistic, quantitative model is appropriate for describing human behavior, and where it is likely to produce nothing but a grotesque caricature. This is a skill that is still being acquired, and it is likely that there will be embarrassments along the way. \r\n\r\nBut properly and judiciously applied, physical science can furnish some valuable tools in areas such as social, economic, and civic planning, and in international negotiation and legislation. It may help us to avoid bad decisions; if we are lucky, it will give us some foresight. If there are emergent laws of traffic, of pedestrian motions, of network topologies, of urban growth, we need to know them in order to plan effectively. Once we acknowledge the universality displayed in the physical world, it should come as no surprise that the world of human social affairs is not necessarily a tabula rasa, open to all options.\r\n\r\nSociety is complex but that does not place it beyond our ken. As we have seen, complexity of form and organization can arise from simple underlying principles if they are followed simultaneously by a great many individuals.</i></blockquote>\r\nThere is a real question about how deep into human behaviour the statistical approach can go. Econophysics, as a term and as a living, funded academic subfield, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore#q=econophysics\">fizzled out shortly after this book was published</a>. Apparently the <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Self-organized_criticality\">SOC</a> results have come in for a lot of criticism, though mostly of their overreach than the method being humanistically inapplicable or whatevs.\r\n\r\nEven so, I wish I had read this 5 years ago: it would have saved me lots of contortions. it taught me a huge amount anyway. (e.g. the <i>huge</i> moral panic, following the invention of descriptive statistics, about <i>ever</i> using means to describe <i>any</i> human characteristics, since the remarkable stability of e.g. the C17th London crime rate across decades seemed to speak of divine or diabolical insurance.) One of my top 5 books on economics, one of my top 5 books on physics.\r\n\r\n<i>In one sentence</i>: Social physics had at last begun to make exciting progress on understanding mass human behaviour.",

He spread word of some of the most terrible injustices of his day; was arrested by several authoritarian regimes for it; he wrote three original, important books (on Teresa, Kissinger and Orwell); he had a lot of fun. That's a good life. Why, then, are we so uneasy? Because of his changing his mind so forcefully about revolution? About America? Because his direct, tactless opposition to conservative Islam sounds vaguely similar to that of contemporary racists? Because he <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/that-time-margaret-thatcher-spanked-christopher-hitchens/274779/\">found Thatcher sexy</a>?\n\nHe raised my estimation of the British 'International Socialists' (i.e. Trots) of the 1960s by a giant interval: though nearly powerless and outnumbered on all sides, they really did resist both the US and Soviet empires <i>and</i> the humourlessness and cultishness of their peers, <i>and</i> post-modern, <a href=\"http://afterallitcouldbeworse.blogspot.co.uk/p/the.html\">Foucaultian</a> passivity, and really did manage to help in undramatic ways (fundraising, letter-writing, war tourism). Bravura. \n\nHow did he get from there to chilling with Wolfowitz? Well, on some points Hitchens didn't change at all; the Left did:\n<blockquote>\n[In 1968] <i>people began to intone the words “The Personal Is Political”. The instant that I first heard this deadly expression, I knew as one does from the utterance of any sinister bullshit that it was very bad news. From now on, it would be enough to a member of a sex or gender, or epidermal subdivision, or erotic “preference”, to qualify as a revolutionary. In order to begin a speech or ask a question from the floor, all that would be necessary by way of preface would be the words, “Speaking as a…” Then could follow any self-loving description. I will have to say this for the old “hard” Left: we earned our claim to speak and intervene by right of experience and sacrifice and work. It would never have done for any of us to stand up and say that our sex or sexuality or pigmentation of disability were qualifications in themselves. There are many ways of dating the moment where the Left lost or – I would prefer to say – discarded its moral advantage, but this was the first time I was to see the sell-out so cheaply.</i>\n\n<i>the Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwah... was, if I can phrase it like this, a matter of everything I hated versus everything I loved. In the hate column: dictatorship, religion, stupidity, demagogy, censorship, bullying, and intimidation. In the love column: literature, irony, humor, the individual, and the defense of free expression... To re-state the premise of the argument again: the theocratic head of a foreign despotism offers money in his own name in order to suborn the murder of a civilian citizen of another country, for the offense of writing a work of fiction. No more root-and-branch challenge to the values of the Enlightenment (on the bicentennial of the fall of the Bastille) or to the First Amendment to the Constitution, could be imagined.</i>\n\n<i>I had become accustomed to the pseudo-Left new style, whereby if your opponent thought he had identified your lowest possible motive, he was quite certain that he had isolated the only real one. This vulgar method, which is now the norm and the standard in much non-Left journalism as well, is designed to have the effect of making any noisy moron into a master analyst.</i>\n\n\n<i>Today I want to puke when I hear the word 'radical' applied so slothfully and stupidly to Islamist murderers; the most plainly reactionary people in the world.</i></blockquote>\nBut never mind that. Lots of gossip, lots of travel writing, lots of quotation from the heart, lots of interesting digressions about the old New Left, nationalisms, Jewishness - have you ever heard of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskalah\">Haskalah</a>? - and two massive eulogies to his dear friends James Fenton and Martin Amis. Everything he said and did from the age of about 18 proceeded from a fully-developed worldview: sarcastic, elevated, British post-Marxist intellectuality.\n\nHe becomes the Hitchens you know - the drawling, boozy pal of neocons, more Dawkins than Dawkins is (\"<i>Everything about Christianity is contained in the pathetic image of 'the flock'.</i>\") - late on in life and even later in the book, so even if you refuse to forgive him his shocking, <i>but internally consistent</i> transformations, it doesn't warp the weft. Beautiful despite crudeness; very modern in several clashing senses.\n\n<i>In one sentence</i>: The establishment's awful, until you get well in it.\n",

    "review": "It is very hard to say anything new about Plato. Except, of course it isn't, because he spoke in the most general possible terms, and the world continues to do unprecedented things and so allow for new commentary and new applications of Plato. It will always be possible to say something new about Plato because, until the heat death draws near, it will be possible to say something new about the world, and criticism should relate the old but general with the new and unanalysed. \n\nThis was really deep fun: Goldstein debunks a great deal about him via close-reading (e.g.: that Plato's book, <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Republic_(Plato)\">Πολιτεία</a>, has no etymological or structural relation to modern republics). Some very moving chapters, too, particularly the neuroscientist dialogue: she renders this man we know almost nothing personal about as polite, curious and modest, willing to suspend judgment on e.g. <i>our</i> popular democracy. The titular chapter is best, involving the philosopher wrestling with one imperfect implementation of his epistemocracy, the data-mining Silicon Valley engineer:\n<blockquote><i>\"You're telling me that the purpose of all of this knowledge is merely to make money? Greed is driving the great search engine for knowledge? This bewilders me... How can those who possess all knowledge, which must include the knowledge of the life most worth living, be interested in using knowledge only for the insignificant aim of making money?\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Plato, I said, I think you have a somewhat exalted view of Google and the nerds who work here.\" \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nerds?\" he said. \"Another word I do not know.\"\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, again I was in a somewhat awkward position, since I didn't want to offend Plato, who struck me, despite his eye contact and excellent manners, as a nerd par excellence. So I fell back on something I'd once heard... that the word was originally \"knurd\", which is \"drunk\" spelled backwards, and was used for students who would rather study than party.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"And the people who work here at Google are all nerds?\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I would say each and every one.\" I smiled at him.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and looked around the café as if he had died and gone to philosophers' heaven.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"My chosen term for nerd\", he said, \"is philosopher-king\".\n</i></blockquote>Goldstein's move for each chapter is to draw out an inconsistency in Plato that later became a persistent philosophical dichotomy; the chapters are all classical dialogues, actually trialogues at least. Also she makes us note how little explanation of modern culture Plato would actually need to be able to deploy his existing arguments. Witty and persuasive. (You'd think I'd need no persuading of the eternal value of philosophy, and nor do I, but I'd no intention of studying Plato properly before this.)\n\n<i>In one sentence</i>: Plato wanders contemporary America, Chromebook tucked under his arm, looking to understand the few ways we are radically different.",

Richie has an eC20th directness about describing other peoples - think Martha Gellhorn or Kipling - their 'pure skin', their atrocity-enabling 'innocence', their circuitousness and tribalism. (It is now sometimes inappropriate, sometimes oppressive to emphasise differences so.) \n<blockquote><i>I cannot imagine Plato thriving here [Japan], with all his absolutes (“the truth,” “the beauty”)... Maybe that is why Japan is so backward (by comparison) in some areas: philosophy, diagnosis. And perhaps why it is so forward in others.\n\nFrom the celebrated farting-contest scroll and the early illustrated </i>He Gassen (The Fart Battle)<i>, up to such recent representations as the delightful farting games in Ozu Yazujiro's </i>Ohayo<i>, Japan's culture is filled with vivid examples... Farting is certainly included in the nature of man:\n<blockquote>\n\"And what is it you all\nAre laughing at, may I ask?\"\nThe retired master's fart.\n\nFour or five people\nInconvenienced\nBy the horse farting\nThe long ferry ride.\n</blockquote>\nJust here, I think, is the difference in attitude between Japan and the West. That a thing </i>is<i> is sufficient to warrant its notice, even celebration. The hypocrisy of the idealistic has not until recently infected Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp:In both cultures the fart is funny but only in Japan is its humanity acknowledged. This entails a full acceptance of the human state. There is even a rubric for such matters, the </i>ningen-kusai<i> (\"smelling of humanity\") and within it the hé (屁) takes an honorable place.\n</blockquote></i>\n<blockquote><i>\nWhat do I want to be when I grow up? An attractive role would be that of the </i>bunjin<i>. He is the Japanese scholar who wrote and painted in the Chinese style, a literatus, something of a poetaster - a pose popular in the 18th century. I, however, would be a later version, someone out of the end of the Meiji, who would pen elegant prose and work up flower arrangements from dried grasses and then encourage spiders to make webs and render it all natural. For him, art is a moral force and he cannot imagine life without it. He is also the kind of casual artist who, after a day's work is done, descends into his pleasure park and dallies.</i>\n</blockquote>\nSimilar to Hitchens in its consistent, adventurous aestheticism, though with much quieter prose; however, neither has that certain Alastair Reid transcendence.

    "review": "Exciting but not persuasive. It's an attempt to borrow the prestige and consensus of the Green movement to push through all the expensive social policies she wanted anyway. \r\n\r\nThat sounds cynical, but she says as much right at the start of the book: \r\n<blockquote><i>I was propelled into a deeper engagement with [environmentalism] partly because I realized it could be a catalyst for forms of social and economic justice in which I already believed... liberals are still averting their eyes, having yet to grasp that climate science has handed them the most powerful argument against unfettered capitalism since William Blake's 'dark Satanic Mills'</i></blockquote>\r\nHere's what I think the central argument is (she never comes out and says it):\r\n<blockquote>Climate change is an existential risk.\r\nCapitalism exacerbates climate change.\r\nTherefore change capitalism.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBut the subtitle's misleading; she constantly blurs the distinction between two theses: 1) 'solving the climate crisis will require regulation of the market', and 2) 'solving the climate crisis will require the abolition of capitalism' In most of this she doesn't endorse (2) at all - \"<i>there is plenty of room to make a profit in a zero-carbon economy</i>\" - and surprisingly she doesn't deny that <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/armine-sahakyan/the-grim-pollution-pictur_b_9266764.html?guccounter=1\">communism</a> <a href=\"https://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1990/09/ridgeway.html\">was worse</a> for the environment than the C20th Western system: \r\n<blockquote><i>...the truth is that, while contemporary, hyper-globalized capitalism has exacerbated the climate crisis, it did not create it. We started treating the atmosphere as our waste dump when we began using coal on a commercial scale in the late 1700s and engaged in similarly reckless ecological practices well before that. Moreover, humans have behaved in this shortsighted way not only under capitalist systems, but under systems that called themselves socialist as well...</i></blockquote>\r\nIf you read closely enough you see her actual target is not capitalism but '<i>extractivism</i>', the (ancient!) tendency of people to exploit natural resources relentlessly.\r\n\r\nThe cause of extractivism is fatuously said to be the philosophical divide between mind and body, whence also science and the industrial revolution. This causation is ascertained in one line, with a vague citation to unnamed feminist scholars having \"recognised\" (by which she means conclusively demonstrated) this at some point (pp.177).\r\n\r\nShe's really good at generating urgency and panic: she calls anything that doesn't cut all 10 petagrams of emissions <i>right away</i> a \"failure\". And since it's a failure, therefore confront and block and yell. (Needless to say, activism can't make all the cuts in time either.)\r\n\r\nShe has a chapter on each of the non-political solutions: so she is sequentially anti-nuclear, anti-GM, anti-geoengineering, anti-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading\">cap</a>, anti-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax\">tax</a>, anti-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/13/richard-branson-failed-climate-change-pledge\">Branson</a>, anti-'corporate reponsibility'. I suspect she's wrong about most of these. But she is most wrong on the matter of carbon pricing and <a href=\"www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/09/naomi_klein_is_wrong_corporations_are_doing_more_than_governments_to_halt.html\">Big Green</a>. We need to stop <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/oecd-fossil-fuel-subsidies-373-billion-2015\">subsidising fossil fuels</a> (you can blame lobbying for those if you like, but this is still a massive government failure). And pricing is the best and least dangerous policy option.\r\n\r\nIn their stead she promotes \"planning and banning\" (vast micromanagement of allowed resources and technologies), divestment (which we know has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/17/why-fossil-fuel-divestment-is-a-misguided-tactic\">no long-term</a> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-divestment-work\">effect</a> on public companies) and blockading machinery (which sorta works but at terrible human cost). She also wants North America to be more northern European, with\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    cheap public transit and clean light rail accessible to all: affordable, energy-efficient housing along those transit lines; cities planned for high-density living; bike lanes in which riders aren’t asked to risk their lives to get to work; land management that discourages sprawl and encourages local, low-energy forms of agriculture; urban design that clusters essential services like schools and health care along transit routes and in pedestrian-friendly areas; programs that require manufacturers to be responsible for the electronic waste their produce...</i></blockquote>\r\nThat's most evocative of the Netherlands. But their infrastructure was not born of mass politics, green or otherwise, but rather of high energy costs and low land per capita. <a href=\"http://induecourse.ca/naomi-klein-this-changes-everything/\">Joseph Heath explains</a> that this cost difference\r\n<blockquote><i>creates the demand for transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly cities, just like the electricity price creates the demand for efficient housing. This is what drives the style of planning that predominates in that country. You can do all the “planning” of urban development you want, but unless people actually want to live in the high-density houses you’re building, they will remain empty. The reason they are attractive to people in the Netherlands is that the alternatives are unattractive, largely because of the cost.\r\n\r\nGiven the impact that prices have on behaviour throughout the economy, it is clear that the ability to control prices is by far the most powerful policy lever that the state has in its possession. Thus the natural upshot of a wish-list like the one Klein presents is that the state should start to price the carbon externality generated through fossil-fuel consumption, through either a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax. And yet this is not what Klein recommends.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nAnyway the market is decarbonising. I would say that we have the benefit of the three years of progress since she wrote this, but the (capitalist) trend was clear back then too: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-energy-consumption-by-region\">17% renewables</a> <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-energy-consumption-by-region\">growth per year</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://rameznaam.com/2016/04/12/how-cheap-can-electric-vehicles-get/\">Electric cars are now cheaper to run than fossil ones</a> and the price curve is tending quickly and strongly down.<a href=\"http://rameznaam.com/2015/08/10/how-cheap-can-solar-get-very-cheap-indeed/\"> New-build solar power is now cheaper per megawatt than oil</a>, and the<a href=\"http://rameznaam.com/2015/10/14/how-cheap-can-energy-storage-get/\"> associated storage cells</a> for night are becoming cheaper even faster. These are both market developments (boosted by subsidies but more and more self-sustaining).\r\n\r\nShe has a long section on how having a child was the cause of her environmentalism - but she fails to reconcile this with the fact that having a child in the developed world is the <a href=\"http://blogs.sps.ed.ac.uk/jwi/2017/09/20/if-having-children-is-bad-for-the-environment-what-should-parents-do-about-it/\">single most</a> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378008001003\">significant environmental footprint</a> for an individual; it would take an extraordinary amount of work to just zero out this harm.\r\n\r\nAs economics this is shaky, and as politics unlikely, but she remains a good journalist. Where by journalist I mean 'person who works at the “These terrible unknown things are happening; here is what the people involved say. What might it mean?” level'. She also writes at the \"Here is the big picture and what to do about it\" level though, and honestly I recommend just walking right by those bits (pages 1 through 300).\r\n\r\nMinus a point because it falsely maligns effective and politically available environment policies, and so has done expected harm. \r\n\r\nRead <a href=\"http://www.inference.org.uk/sustainable/book/tex/sewtha.pdf\">Mackay</a> and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/renewables\">OWiD</a> instead.",

His <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-letters-ever-written/answer/Abhishek-Srivastava-317\">letter to his 10yo daughter</a> is maybe the clearest statement of sceptical empiricism ever, though it also displays the blithe wonkishness that alienates most people:\n<blockquote><i>Suppose I told you that your dog was dead. You’d be very upset, and you’d probably say, ‘Are you sure? How do you know? How did it happen?’ Now suppose I answered: ‘I don’t actually know that Pepe is dead. I have no evidence. I just have this funny feeling deep inside me that he is dead.’ You’d be pretty cross with me for scaring you, because you’d know that an inside ‘feeling’ on its own is not a good reason for believing that a whippet is dead. You need evidence. We all have inside feelings from time to time, and sometimes they turn out to be right and sometimes they don’t. Anyway, different people have opposite feelings, so how are we to decide whose feeling is right? The only way to be sure that a dog is dead is to see him dead, or hear that his heart has stopped; or be told by somebody who has seen or heard some real evidence that he is dead.\n\nPeople sometimes say that you must believe in your deep feelings inside, otherwise you’d never be confident of things like ‘My wife loves me’. But this is a bad argument. There can be plenty of evidence that somebody loves you. All through the day when you are with somebody who loves you, you see and hear lots of little tidbits of evidence, and they all add up. It isn’t purely inside feeling, like the feeling that priests call revelation. There are outside things to back up the inside feeling: looks in the eye, tender notes in the voice, little favors and kindnesses; this is all real evidence.</i></blockquote>\nAaag he used to be so wise and grand, giving out words to live by.

    "review": "An attempted defence of the current reigning artistic paradigm: low-skill, high-concept, contemptuous of past, audience, and self; identitarian. Call it <i>anaesthetic conceptualism</i>. It is also a nice illustrated catalogue of some recent objects that have managed to piss various people off. 150 years ago, we direly needed people to make art larger, to stand against the Academic approach of Nice Hard Mimesis Only. The problem is that since the 50s many artists replaced that shallow spectacle of mere mimetic skill with the even shallower spectacle of empty originality and flashy cynicism. This book has <i>such</i> a patronising presentation; it could have been named \"How to explain conceptualism to your five year-old\". (I guess that could have been an intentional irony, but to me it just told me what she thinks of anyone sceptical of the trend. But some kudos for being clear, since this makes the hollowness of her points blatant.)\r\n\r\nI have to applaud her; unlike the rest of her curator peers, she has at least <i>attempted</i> to justify a gigantically expensive, creativity-draining, status-hogging practice with close readings. I should also thank her for tacitly admitting that the only hermeneutics that can justify anaesthetic conceptualism is a small-minded and super-conservative intentionalism (i.e. 'what matters about the work is what the artist meant').* \"It doesn't really matter how the object looks; what really matters is how deep the creator was and how much history you can project on it.\" But this philosophy of art is convincing to no-one not already invested in the great tedious playground. I dislike most of this art, and this way of talking about it, because I want to love art.***\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is a useful catalogue of the kind of low-skill pieces that have only recently been possible and that you need to know about to move in certain presumably unbearable circles.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n* Though the so-called <a href=\"http://faculty.smu.edu/nschwart/seminar/fallacy.htm\">intentional fallacy</a> is not actually a fallacy** - it does not make sense to say that someone is <i>literally mistaken</i> to think that the creator's view of an artwork is the only relevant one, since aesthetic interpretation doesn't admit of literal error - instead it's just an incredibly limited and superstitious philosophy - along the same lines as deontology in ethics. It makes art a small and mostly ancient thing, while aesthetic experience could instead rise to each of the potential billions of minds that come to it, and it always takes place in the present, with entirely novel meanings generated, far beyond the ken of any creator.\r\n\r\n\r\n** I'm aware that 'fallacy' has found usage outside of its original meaning, 'a failure in logical reasoning'. But the new usage, committed for instance by Beardsley, is something shitey like 'a horrible belief I don't like boo'. I'm generally torn between a descriptive and a prescriptive philosophy of vocabulary, but in this case the bullying and sloppy-mindedness of the new usage makes me deny it outright. Some words are too important to give up. (Mostly epistemology tbf.)\r\n\r\n*** This is an unforgivably poncey thing to say, not least because I don't think I really mean it. If crap artists had not usurped a good portion of all the species' attention and reverence, I don't think I'd care what modern art was like. But as it is they are cheaters - even the great ones. They cheat themselves into immortality and perceived profundity via the handy expedient of prettiness and vagueness or ugliness and vagueness. In a way, they and we cheat malaria victims of <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/July_2015_United_Kingdom_budget#/Spending\">huge sums</a>, while the very people who claim to care about global injustices cheer us dumping more money into it, while saying things like 'life isn't worth living without art'. Well, <i>maybe</i> it wouldn't be, but life is not worth living if you're dead either, and <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Culture%20is%20not%20about%20Esthetics\">there is enough art already</a>.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",

    "review": "Bureaucracy is the dominant structure in adult life throughout the world. And everybody hates it, including the people nominally in power. How does <i>that</i> work? This book is his answer and is full of his usual sparkling sentences and big dubious historical claims:\r\n<blockquote><i>The organization of the Soviet Union was directly modeled on that of the German postal service.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nHe is sadly <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2434061627\">not to be trusted on technical matters</a> or in fact anything really contentious. But he's good on some other things.\r\n\r\nHe notes that corporate life is just as bureaucratic as the public sector, but that corporations are rarely called bureaucracies. This is important! He further notes that left-wing utopias tend to envision vastly stifling regulation and committees as their only lever against unfairness and abuse. \r\n\r\nThe book is slightly overegged - but compared to most anarchist social theory he is a model of rigour, epistemic care and systematic focus. In fact he is critical of his people's theorists and practitioners:\r\n<blockquote><i>Foucault’s ascendancy in turn was precisely within those fields of academic endeavor that both became the haven for former radicals, but that were themselves most completely divorced from any access to political power, or increasingly, even to real social movements—which gave Foucault’s emphasis on the “power/knowledge” nexus, the assertion that forms of knowledge are always also forms of social power, indeed, the most important forms of social power, a particular appeal. <br><br>No doubt any such historical argument is a bit caricaturish and unfair; but I think there is a profound truth here. It is not just that we are drawn to areas of density, where our skills at interpretation are best deployed. We also have an increasing tendency to identify what’s interesting and what’s important, to assume places of density are also places of power. The power of bureaucracy shows just how much this is often not the case. </i></blockquote>\r\nHe yields too much to standpoint theory when he is told that they had similar ideas earlier (which he hadn't read and which they didn't put so clearly). But he's fun and witty, heretical to his tribe, original as always. \r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>...if we’re going to actually come up with robots that will do our laundry or tidy up the kitchen, we’re going to have to make sure that whatever replaces capitalism is based on a far more egalitarian distribution of wealth and power — one that no longer contains either the super-rich or desperately poor people willing to do their housework. Only then will technology begin to be marshaled toward human needs. And this is the best reason to break free of the dead hand of the hedge fund managers and the CEOs—to free our fantasies from the screens in which such men have imprisoned them, to let our imaginations once again become a material force in human history.</i></blockquote>",

    "review": "The Old Testament has roughly 700 rules of varying severity and absurdity; Jacobs tried to follow all of them for a year. For a host of reasons, this can't be done, and so this is a reductio of biblical literalism. It is also a sympathetic anthropology of the literal Other Side, who are low-status, even in parts of America. \r\n\r\n*<li>The mad rules: never wear mixed fibres; no rubber tires; burning a red cow is the only way to be pure person; all the precise shabbat rules about what you can and can't do; basically anything involving women. Judaism actually has a specific word for the arbitrary, stupid divine laws: the <i><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/search/keyword_cdo/kid/14032/jewish/Browse-by-Subject.htm\">chukim</a></i>. The various brilliant, witty cafeteria theists he consults are open about them being silly tests - fun puzzles, even.</li>\r\n\r\n* <li>The blatantly evolutionary / patriarchal rules: no other gods before me, no shellfish, <a href=\"http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm\">modest women</a>. </li>\r\n\r\n* <li>He is keen to show the noble side to the real literalists: they practice tithing, pacifism, no hell, are activists for global debt jubilee. (A handful of lovely policies out of the mad and thoughtless other 700, mind you.) One group are even admirable on epistemic, philological grounds!: \"<i>You can't follow all of the Bible literally because we can't know what some of the words mean.</i>\" Sure they take this to be a reason to be even more extreme than ever stipulated, just to be safe, but I admire the rigour of it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nAn extremely open-minded man; he meets the Creation Museum people, and the Amish, and the snake handlers. I didn't like the constant stream of cheap gags or his wielding family details for padding. I def didn't like his earnest attempt to use cognitive dissonance to delude himself into theism:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>The notion of obeying laws that have no rational explanation is a jarring one. For most of my life, I've been working under the paradigm that my behavior should have a logical basis. But if you live biblically, this is not true. I have to adjust my brain to this.</i>\r\n...\r\n\r\n<i>When I first read the parable of the prodigal son, I was perplexed. I felt terrible for the older brother. The poor man put in all these years of loyal service, and his brother skips town, has a wild good time, then returns, and gets a huge feast? It seems outrageously unfair.\r\n\r\nBut that's if you're thinking quantitatively. If you're looking at life as a balance sheet.\r\nThere's a beauty to forgiveness, especially forgiveness that goes beyond rationality. Unconditional love is an illogical notion, but such a great and powerful one.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n(That simply strikes me as choosing to be mistaken and then hardening oneself to injustice.) \r\n\r\n\r\nHe is not quite sophisticated enough to pull off rigorous naturalist wonder fully (but again this is me cruelly comparing a journalist to Nietzsche, Pessoa, Gopnik). But the following affirmation of mythos here is more or less my view:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>I'm still agnostic. But in the words of Elton Richards, I'm now a reverant agnostic. Which isn't an oxymoron, I swear. I now believe that whether or not there's a God, there is such a thing as sacredness. Life is sacred. The Sabbath can be a sacred day. Prayer can be a sacred ritual. There is something transcendent, beyond the everyday. It's possible that humans created this sacredness ourselves, but that doesn't take away from its power or importance.</i> \r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nLiteralism is impossible, immoral and inconsistent with our new, better picture of the world; biblical liberalism is mercenary and inconsistent with itself. So don't bother?\r\n",

Morozov is, bluntly, afraid for us all <i>because</i> software is eating the world:\n\n<blockquote><i>Imperfection, ambiguity, opacity, disorder and the opportunity to err, to sin: all of these are constitutive of human freedom, and any concentrated attempt to root them out will root out that freedom as well... we risk finding ourselves with a politics devoid of everything that makes politics desirable, with humans who have lost their basic capacity for moral reasoning, with lackluster cultural institutions that don't take risks and, most terrifyingly, with a perfectly controlled social environment that would make dissent not just  impossible but possibly even unthinkable...</i></blockquote>\n\nBut I do not want the freedom to believe harmful falsehoods, nor the freedom to hide my errors behind ambiguity; nor the freedom to throw away resources which others need. And I don't want the freedom to waste my life. Technology is the only untried way of responding to our grave Darwinian inheritance of intolerance, selfishness, and irrationality.

He reads post-punk as far wider than the sombre anti-rock art-school thing people usually take it to be - so he includes Human League and ABC as post-punks with emphasis on the post:\n<blockquote>\n<i>To varying degrees, all these groups grasped the importance of image, its power to seduce and motivate. And they all coated their music in a patina of commercial gloss, some of them pursuing a strategy of entryism, while others simply revelled in sonic luxury for the sheer glam thrill of it; it's simply inaccurate to portray New Pop, as some histories of the period have, as a 'like punk never happened' scenario. Almost all of the groups had some connection to punk... \n\nNew Pop was about making the best of the inevitable - synths and drum machines, video, the return of glamour. Colour, dance, fun and style were sanctioned as both strategically necessary (the terms of entry into pop) and pleasurable (now acceptable, with the rejection of post-punk's guilt-racked puritanism).</i></blockquote>\n\nHis scope is total: everything's here (except for oi, hardcore, Ramonescore - i.e. the people who failed to make it past punk). Reynolds divides the genre/period in three broad camps:\n<ol>\n* <li>modernists (PiL, Cab Vol, No Wave, industrial, SST prog-punk), </li>\n* <li>post-pop (New Pop, electro, mutant disco, synth) </li>\n* <li>retro-eclectics (two-tone, Goth, neo-mods).</li>\n</ol>\n\nHe gives chapters to the Other Places of lC20th popular music: whether Akron (Devo, Pere Ubu), Leeds (Gang of Four, Mekons), Sheffield (Cabaret Voltaire, Human League), Edinburgh (Fire Engines, Josef K, Associates). There is a covert critique of punk (that is, the messianic punks) throughout the book:\n<blockquote>\n<i>Elsewhere, The Heartbreakers' stodge of refried Chuck Berry was barely more advanced than British pub rock; Dr Feelgood on an IV drip of smack rather than lager...\n\nWhile the committed activists spouted the textbook party line, a more diffuse left-wing academic culture existed based on a sort of ideological pick 'n' mix: a trendy-lefty autodidactism fuelled by second-hand paperbacks and beginner's guides to Gramsci, Lukacs, and Althusser , garnished with Situationism...\n\nBlending often-incompatible systems of thought, the resulting hodge-podge lacked rigour from the stern standpoint of academics and ideologues alike. But in rock music, a little rigour is rather bracing and galvanising. In the grand tradition of British art-rock, theory helped them achieve the sort of conceptual breakthroughs that more organically evolving groups never reach.</i></blockquote>\n\nInstead, his favourites are the gorgeous misfits-among-misfits, who managed to be neither modernist nor entryist nor shill: Talking Heads, Meat Puppets, Associates, Japan. Crucially, he is charitable to all the tributaries: chart-hungry post-pop, politically-rabid modernism and the interminable ugliness of Throbbing Gristle, Whitehouse and No Wave: this makes Rip It Up real history rather than hagiography, and so much more than I or anyone has managed.\n\nHe has more critical acumen than any of the mooks in the brainy bands; more love than the fey melodists. I have lived in the post-punk woods - too jaded and too hopeful to be a punk - for getting on a decade, and I thought myself a connoisseur: until now I was not. ",

Instead there is second-hand gossip dressed up as historical context and post-structuralist intertextuality (“Jaussian reception theory”: the discussion of reviews,  ad campaigns, corporate manoeuvring). Materialism (in critical theory) is the position that both artwork and authors are irrelevant to the study of the artwork.\r\n<blockquote><i>Let us, then, register modern auteurism in a reception practice whereby the authored film can compete for the reader’s attention in a coming together of inter- and extra-textual determinations through which the modern film spectator composes the aesthetic text for herself or himself...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nI’m not suggesting Todd is dishonest, or intentionally vague: instead, I think film studies has convinced him that shuffling these words around is intellectual work.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Note for your calibration of my opinion</i>: I was very much looking forward to this book (because I find Lynch watchable but confusing), and so I fell far. Also it’s been a while since I read any academic Arts work that didn’t strike me as hollow and fatally decoupled from the work at hand. Let alone its coupling to the world.

There <i>is</i> this section, which doesn't manage to be <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7443812-the-fact-is-that-civilisation-requires-slaves-the-greeks-were\">as thoughtful as Oscar Wilde in 1891</a>:\r\n<blockquote><i>here's the truth: luxury always comes at someone else's expense. One of the many advantages of civilization is that one doesn't generally have to see that, if one doesn't wish. You're free to enjoy its benefits without troubling your conscience.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThat seems to be true of her imperialists, the Radch. But why? They have extremely competent superhuman AIs, like the protagonist, but for some reason their economy is still scarce and material.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist One Esk is quite good; think Commander Data plus an oath of vengeance. The superior force serving a blithe master: I'm actually reminded of Jeeves (high praise). That said, the morality of her vengeance quest is dubious: she knows she's setting off a galactic civil war and doesn't even think her assassination will accomplish anything. Maybe the next book will do a <i>Dune Messiah</i> and turn the triumph of this book to ashes and despair.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nHow does it do as Serious science fiction?\r\n\r\n<i>    Social development</i>: Some. Lots of different genderings and a nice baroque Space Feudalism.\r\n\r\n<i>    Software development</i>: None.\r\n\r\n<i> Actual Science</i>: None?",

What a marvellous predicament! Not only is the end not in sight, the pace is not slackening.

(You sometimes see the like of this in honest philosophy books, included as ‘<a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/feyerabe.htm\">analytical index</a>’ or ‘prolegomenon’ or ‘exordium’.) Brooks is not merely exoteric, not just an IBM mook; suitably acerbic and suitably enthusiastic. \n\nThe open secret of programming is that it is actually a whole barrel of <a href=\"http://people.apache.org/~acmurthy/WhyIsProgrammingFun.html\">fun</a>, just one that baffles, bores or scares outsiders:\n<blockquote><i>The craft of programming gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men, providing five kinds of joys:\n• The joy of making things;\n• The joy of making things that are useful to other people;\n• The fascination of fashioning puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts;\n• The joy of always learning, of a nonrepeating task; \n• The delight of working in a medium so tractable — pure thought-stuff — which nevertheless exists, moves, and works in a way that word-objects do not.\n</blockquote></i>\n\n(NB: The Christian God rears up at unexpected intervals – and at one point Brooks recommends openly patriarchal programming teams - on the model of “God’s plan for marriage”. But this lone wacko note doesn't get in the way.)\n\n\n* (I set myself Shannon, Wang, Knuth.)\n",

(The exoteric writer says exactly what she means, minimises ambiguity and tries to do everything with explicit reasoning, for the largest audience they can, with imagery and irony only as decoration. The esoteric writer – distinct from, but often coextensive with the woo-woo mystical metaphysics fans also called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esotericism\">esoteric</a> – does the converse. \r\n\r\nMost ancient writers wrote esoterically, which is one reason that undergrads and other fools, like me, think that ancient writers are vague and low on content. Up to now, I have been confusing the rhetorical stance - see Heidegger, Deleuze, Derrida, Caputo - with the magickal crap. But so much of the Analytic / Continental divide can be explained in this single distinction! [The revival of the distinction is due to that lionized demon <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_and_the_Art_of_Writing\">Leo Strauss</a>.] Maths is an interesting border case, but its clarity and attempt to destroy ambiguity make it exoteric, I think.) \r\n\r\nThe exoteric intention strikes me as firstly just good manners and important for intellectual honesty (accountability, critical clarity). But one thing I dislike about studying computer science is that <i>all</i> the materials are utterly exoteric. I crave art and irreverence in formal contexts, and those are always at least somewhat esoteric. The ‘Agile’ software thing strikes me as good, a way of making the hag-ridden and monstrously expensive dev process work. But all the material around Agile, LEAN (and the wider business-marketing-HR-systems theory blah that represents most employed adults’ only engagement with passably academic work) is so exoteric that something in me rebels. \r\n",

The book was originally a <i>New Yorker</i> series, fitting their house style – gossip about the transcendental – but there’s more gossip than concepts. We get to relive all the angry <i>Times</i> responses to bitchy reviews, learn what Toynbee ordered for dinner at the Athenaeum in late ’62; also the hair colour of everyone involved (Murdoch ‘<i>straight and blonde, recalling the peasant aspect of Saint Joan</i>’). To their faces, Mehta is too much the deferential alumn, tentatively prodding the dons to be unkind about their peers. \r\n\r\nThe humans are worth it, if you already care: Austin and Namier are tragic hubristic husks; Hare, Ayer, and Toynbee’s charisma blare straight through Mehta’s quiet journalism. \r\n\r\nThe common point between the history and philosophy of the time is both fields' slow recovery from positivism/Wittgensteinian reductionism - the cautious return of theory, and of <i>human</i> posits. (In a sense Wittgenstein was still a reductionist when he was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations\">a holist</a>, since he obsessed over language even as he denied science's entry into various sides of life.) \r\n\r\nMehta has some spirit: after meeting Strawson (Snr.) he says “I took my leave of the scaled-down Kant.”; he finishes the book with this wonderful medievalism:\r\n<blockquote><i>Unless a philosopher finds for us an acceptable faith or synthesis – as Plato and Aristotle did together for their age, and St Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant for theirs – we remain becalmed on a painted ocean of controversy, and for better or worse, insofar as the past is a compass to the future, there will never be anyone to whistle thrice for us and say, once and for all, ‘The game is done! I’ve won! I’ve won!’</i></blockquote>",

Uses <i>ad hominem</i> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulverism\">Bulwerism</a> openly - despite that going against his own ideal of reason - because he views a great range of people as being too mad to engage with. \r\n\r\nHis other move is to use the positivist's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verificationism\">wood-chipper principle</a> a lot: 'your position is literally meaningless; you're too stupid to see this', occasionally correctly. Attacks idealists mostly, including whole chapters making fun of Goodman, Nozick, and Popper(!) - but does not spare Mill (\"here doing his usual service of making mistakes very <i>clearly</i>\") and Russell, who you'd think were his kind of men. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/wrongthoughts.html\">The last chapter</a> is scary and hilarious and suggests the man's basic pain, underneath his roaring pessimism.

    "review": "Poems from people not known as poets, yielding a equal mix of dedicatories, doggerel, and diamond. Their styles are mostly preserved, epitomised: the big grim novelists (Lessing, Coetzee, Fowles, Murdoch, Golding) write enormous grit-tooth verse; \n<blockquote> <i>Heads bowed down or thrown\n  Backward open-eyed\n Here and there are dark \n  With terrible deaf pictures.\n Sounds rise up and vanish \n  Into a pitted dome.\n It continues to rain.\n The acoustics being imperfect some people fidget.\n \n Something which is pure is come  \n To a high magnetic field.\n Cry out as it passes on  When shall we be healed?</i></blockquote>\n\nRaymond Briggs, a quiet, brutal elegy; David Lodge, some good meta jokes; animal bits from Jan Morris and Stella Gibbons; Wodehouse, two wonderful gossipy hyperboles. Adams manages to pick out the only Naomi Mitchison poems I don’t like. A lot of unbridled sentiment, e.g. Arnold Wesker depressing his children, Francis King's lies spiralling down, Enoch Powell lying awake listening to his wife's asthma; the writers aren't expecting the irony-making pressures of publication, or the obsessive polishing of any work that will be identified with <i>them</i>. So it's free indeed. Until Adams.\n",

    "review": "1967 CE:\r\n<blockquote><i>Gin I speak wi the tungs o men an angels, but hae nae luve i my hairt, I am no nane better nor dunnerin bress or a rínging cymbal. Gin I hae the gift o prophecíe an am acquent wi the saicret mind o God, an ken aathing ither at man may ken, an gin I hae siccan faith as can flit the hills frae their larachs - gin I hae aa that, but hae nae luve i my hairt, I am nocht.

But the grytest o the three is luve.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nIn the form that survived, Scots is a uniformly profane language – not in the sense of profanity, but as in worldly and comic and demotic. Some of that opinion is classist stereotype; it certainly wasn't true four hundred years ago (the devotional poems of <a href=\"http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/conlee-dunbar-complete-works-poems-devotional-and-moral\">Dunbar</a> and Henryson stand up to the sacred efforts in any language); but most is real, down to Knox's decision on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Bible\">a legally-mandatory bible in English</a>, but even more to the cultural capture of the nation’s Anglicised elites, but even more than that to the simple dictates of shared economic activity, over three hundred years: i.e. <i>we gave</i> English our sacred talk, then we gave English our intellectual talk, and then trade talk, and law talk, and all their formal accoutrements. Until only the informal and proletarian was left. Atweill, the kitsch prevails (“Hoots ma wee bonnie lassie! Ahiiii wid wauk fyv hhundrid myles”).  When Lorimer wrote this, the dialectisation of Scots, and the cutesy granny-aff-a-bus process wasn’t so advanced - but this is the register we moderns read it in, unless we are rural and lucky.\r\n\r\n(Nasty but probable thing I once heard a linguist lecture on: relatively few languages develop the scientific-philosophical register and benefit from its sharpening vocabularies. He reckoned that only nine ever have, <i>fully</i>: Chinese, Arabic, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Russian, German, French, English. Scots definitely had speakers sophisticated enough, in its High Medieval heyday, but the internationalist use of Latin precluded it.)\r\n\r\nLorimer saw a Bible translation as one of two conditions of revitalising braid Scots - the language, rather than the dialect Scots English. (The other big brick being <a href=\"http://www.dsl.ac.uk/\">the Dictionary</a>.) Well, we have both now, and they are not enough. The argument for bringing back languages is only superficially humane, since language is for communication <i>first</i>, and our condition is more and more a global one. (I find it difficult to fault <a href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/agreeable-ways-to-disable-your-children/\">Katja Grace’s analysis</a>: the standard arguments fail, the present matters more than the past: because it is where value happens.) \r\n\r\nLorimer translated it straight from the Koine Greek over a full decade, finishing the second draft just before his death. The art comes in his rendering the apostles with their own voice and distinctive idiolect. (Paul is, here as ever, a nasty little man: smug and litigious.) While I’m very glad this exists, the book itself can do little for me, whatever language it’s wearing. (Nothing takes me further from religious awe than the actual things we said God said. Hauflin’ indeed.) \r\n\r\nN/A.",

    "review": "[The following review is too credulous: I wrote it before it became clear that the book is at best a noble-lie exaggeration and <a href=\"https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/#appendix-what-do-you-do-when-a-part-of-the-graph-contradicts-your-argument-you-cut-it-out-of-course\">at worst statistical</a> fraud with unjustified practical claims. Downgrade your credence in all nonfiction that's outside your expertise, including reviews like this one.]\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nWalker: <blockquote><i>\tScientists have discovered a revolutionary treatment that makes you live longer. It enhances your memory and makes you more creative. It makes you look more attractive. It keeps you slim and lowers food cravings. It protects you from cancer and dementia. It wards off colds and the flu. It lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke, not to mention diabetes. You’ll even feel happier, less depressed, and less anxious. Are you interested?\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nImportant topic: he claims there's a free, riskless intervention to add years to your lifespan and fundamentally improve your mind. (The flip side of this claim is a horror story about a society that mentally disables its members.)\r\n\r\nOur school system, ladies and gents:\r\n<blockquote><i>\tMore than 80 percent of public high schools in the United States begin before 8:15 a.m. Almost 50 percent of those start before 7:20 a.m. School buses for a 7:20 a.m. start time usually begin picking up kids at around 5:45 a.m. As a result, some children and teenagers must wake up at 5:30 a.m., 5:15 a.m., or even earlier, and do so five days out of every seven, for years on end. This is lunacy...\r\n\r\n\tPreviously, we noted that the circadian rhythm of teenagers shifts forward dramatically by one to three hours. So really the question I should ask you, if you are an adult, is this: Could you concentrate and learn anything after having forcefully been woken up at 3:15 a.m., day after day after day? Would you be in a cheerful mood? Would you find it easy to get along with your coworkers and conduct yourself with grace, tolerance, respect, and a pleasant demeanor? Of course not. Why, then, do we ask this of the millions of teenagers and children in industrialized nations?\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nAnd elsewhere he notes that time in school is useless without restfulness. Burn it down.\r\n<blockquote><i>\tInsufficient sleep has also been linked to aggression, bullying, and behavioral problems in children across a range of ages. A similar relationship between a lack of sleep and violence has been observed in adult prison populations; places that, I should add, are woefully poor at enabling good sleep that could reduce aggression, violence, psychiatric disturbance, and suicide\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe theory of sleep (circadian rhythm and adenosine cycle determining when, NREM and REM determining what) is very neat but I'm not qualified to say if it's mature. There's also vast and baffling cross-species variation, which Walker doesn't pretend to understand: \"<i>amount (e.g., [hours per day]), form (e.g., half-brain, whole-brain), and pattern (monophasic, biphasic, polyphasic)</i>\" or ground / tree.\r\n\r\nThe adenosine cycle - the absolutely failsafe connection between activity and fatigue - is one of my favourite theories in biology. (The account here doesn't do it justice.)\r\n\r\nHe's sceptical of <a href=\"http://gwern.net/Melatonin\">oral melatonin</a> <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/10/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/\">therapy</a>, but he doesn't consider the main argument in favour, which is that our many hours of blue-light at night is a systematic deviation from ancestral conditions, with no sensible alternative mitigation (f.lux can only do so much). (He instead puts faith in warm LEDs and smart bulbs, currently thousands of dollars each.) At least he doesn't spread the <a href=\"https://examine.com/supplements/melatonin/\">unsupported idea</a> that taking it results in negative hormonal feedback.  This doesn't surprise me:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n\tScientific evaluations of over-the-counter brands have found melatonin concentrations that range from 83 percent less than that claimed on the label, to 478 percent more than that stated\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n- but this is the price of having it over-the-counter in the first place. (It is anyway completely safe to take a 6x dose, just much less effective.)\r\n\r\nHe's very in favour of afternoon naps, the \"biphasic\" pattern, based on relatively weak observational evidence:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n\tthose that abandoned regular siestas went on to suffer a 37 percent increased risk of death from heart disease across the six-year period, relative to those who maintained regular daytime naps.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThere's lots of evolutionary speculation, which really pisses off some readers for some reason, even when tagged as speculation. (e.g. Do teenagers stay up later to procreate outwith parental supervision?)\r\n\r\nHe is a crusader all right - for instance, he doesn't really do any cost-benefit consideration, instead just maximising sleep, even instead of taking your asthma meds. Yes, the costs of sleep deprivation are extremely high - but so's the cost of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/2/4/7972077/against-oversleeping\">spending 30 years in a coma</a>.\r\n\r\nI think I'm pretty much optimised: I already quit caffeine, redshifted all screens, got 0.3mg melatonin, started wearing an eye mask, don't drink much, exercise every day, fixed a bedtime, and live somewhere quiet with big bedroom windows. (I also got a less melodramatic and anxious worldview by studying <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2426950247\">economic history</a>, which Walker doesn't cover - fair enough, since the intervention can only help scared intellectuals.) Things which I enjoy enough to handle the sleep cost: nicotine and eating late. \r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep:\r\n\r\n1. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.\r\n2. Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. \r\n3. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. \r\n4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. \r\n5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. \r\n6. If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep.\r\n7. Don’t take naps after 3 p.m. \r\n8. Relax before bed... reading or listening to music, should be part of your bedtime ritual.\r\n9. Take a hot bath before bed. \r\n10. Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom.\r\n11. Have the right sunlight exposure. Try to get outside in natural sunlight for at least thirty minutes each day.\r\n12. Don’t lie in bed awake... get up and do some relaxing activity until you feel sleepy. \r\n\r\n</blockquote></i>",

    "review": "Yet another volley in the ‘<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/js2/the_rationality_wars/\">rationality wars</a>’. GG sets himself against the heuristics and biases folk (though note he is also not of the fatuous constructionist camp which says, roughly: ‘it’s impossible for <i>everyone</i> to be irrational, because reason is <i>only</i> social, so we are the measure of it’) by minimising the apparent irrationality uncovered by the cognitive sciences in the last little while. Key claims: \n<ol>\n- <li>Heuristics are not just faster or more tractable, but <i>better</i> than Bayesian formalism.</li>\n- <li>People are not flawed Bayesians but natural frequentists.</li>\n</ol>\n\nBut though his work on presenting natural frequencies is super-important, and his points about actual decisions always being 'ecological' (rather than a mathematical problem) I suspect he's (<a href=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/Csci6402/Papers/kahneman-tversky.pdf\">still</a>) 1) attacking a straw version of Kahneman-Gilovich-Slovic-Stanovich: no-one is saying that perfect, everyday Bayesian algorithmics is attainable by humans; nor are the misconceptions in table 1.1 (<a href=\"http://www.thedivineconspiracy.org/Z5274K.pdf\">p.9</a>) ever stated as strongly as this. \n\nAlso 2) GG's evidence on e.g. the framing of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy\">conjunction fallacy</a> doesn't replicate. But anyway this is well-argued, well-written, scientific in the highest sense, and wrong? Read <a href=\"http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ArchiveFolder/Research%20Group/Publications/Wars/wars.html\">this</a> instead. \n\nNot as deep as I expected, but I admire his empirical work.",

    "review": "One of the <i>Frankensteins</i>, those endlessly interpretable load-bearing columns dotted around literature. Of negation, dignity, irrationality, silence, impermeability. \r\n\r\nWhat is Bartleby, if not just depressed or hyper-lazy? Well there’s the defensive Stoic catatonia, or wu wei; Bartleby as crypto-proto-Marxist; Bartleby as waning Übermensch, squatter monk, annoying Christ; Bartleby as dissociating schizophrene or autist; Bartleby as Death of Dead Letters; Bartleby as PTSD ghost; Bartleby as all our inarticulate idiosyncracy, as utter Other – “<i>pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn</i>!” \r\n\r\nSome people (e.g. <a href=\"http://autonomies.org/ar/2012/12/figures-of-bartlebys-rebellion-2/\">Blanchot</a>, <a href=\"http://www.culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/rt/printerFriendly/39/47\">Hardt & Negri</a>, <a href=\"http://ideasofimperfection.blogspot.co.uk/2009/10/rest-is-silence.html\">Setiya</a>) view him as heroic, but he’s more hallucinogenic and morbid: he lacks everything but refusal; he throws his life away. And that’s a living death, a non-human void (“I never feel so private as when I know [Bartleby is] here”). \r\n<blockquote> <i>So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain point the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but, in certain special cases, beyond that point it does not. They err who would assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness of the human heart. It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of remedying excessive and organic ill. To a sensitive being, pity is not seldom pain. And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot lead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul be rid of it.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat copyists are an extinct breed only adds to the seething flavour; it is <i>possible</i> that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition\">OCR</a> and distributed Captchas could have minimised Bartleby’s suffering - that the condition the piece wrangles with isn’t eternal. What would Bartleby be today? Not, I think, an <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/04/occupy-wall-streets-debt-to-melville/256482/\">Occupier</a>; rather a impassive backstreets bookshop owner, or a kombucha stallholder or whatnot. \r\n\r\nI prefer to read Melville’s voice - waffling Victorian persiflage - as an assumed decoration for the windbag lawyer’s voice (however much <i>Moby Dick</i> shouts otherwise).",

She begins with slurs of all sorts, but doesn’t list any homophobia – claiming it isn’t a well-rooted hatred there (…). There’s loads and loads of ableism, though. Gets more serious as it goes, with whole chapters on gay culture and web ‘activism’ (恶搞 is ‘evildoings’, lulz). This turns up details like the infallibly hilarious “potato queen”. I also loved her decoding the ancient innuendoes: 云雨 (clouds and rain), 鱼水之欢 (the fish and the water, happy together), 余桃 (sharing peaches), or “playing the bamboo flute” or “bamboo harmonica”. \n\n(BTW, the title term is 牛屄 – ‘Cow-cunt’ – and means “Awesome!”.

It's undermined by the editing; the narrative is too neat (at one point she happens to bump into the family of the homeless woman that called her saying how much she missed them). Maybe she just had a very cinematic few years, as one of the most famous women in the country, but the many coincidences and stranger-than-fiction dovetails make it difficult to take it too seriously. I don’t actually doubt that the interviews happened, nor that she received the aggregate worry and misery for thousands. It's just that she portrays as a little village where Xinran was wise mother, with all distant rumours bursting into her life. \r\n\r\nMaybe my reaction is a cheap defence against e.g. the thought of an 11 year old repeatedly giving themselves pneumonia to avoid their rapist father and other tales of ordinary madness.",

    "review": "Good for a YA book. Interesting lore, good structure, inconsistent worldbuilding, portentous/glib tone, painful slang. \r\n\r\n<b>Lore</b>: the Earth hates us, which is why there is so much suffering. Includes a (true) evolutionary gradient:\r\n<blockquote><i>Earth our father knew He would need clever life, so He used the Seasons to shape us out of animals: clever hands for making things and clever minds for solving problems and clever tongues for working together and clever sessapinae to warn us of danger.  The people became what Father Earth needed, and then more than He needed.  Then we turned on Him, and He has burned with hatred for us ever since.</blockquote></i>\r\nShe later ruins this interesting cosmogony by clubbing you over the head with a message (that the lethal climate shock Seasons started after people polluted the world too much).\r\n\r\nThe world is a blend of <i>GoT</i> survivalist folk religion and apocalyptically cyclical climate, <i>X-Men</i> despised chaos mages, <i>Battlestar</i> breeding body horror, <i>Earthsea</i> folk magic and wu wei, and superstitious racism. It mostly works.\r\n\r\n<b>Structure</b>: Three quite different focal characters, later shown to be the same person over time. I didn't spot the first unification coming, and it was satisfying.\r\n\r\nShe leaves the big <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild\">Soylent Green</a> reveal until page 108; until then you're left wondering if all the grey objectification is justified by the terrible security risk. \r\n\r\nShe's pretty glib about the two communities outside the Empire, full of earthquake witches who are shown regularly freezing or nuking things when even mildly irked. The utopian pirate community is also heavily rose-tinted - sure, they <i>do</i> kill people in order to take their stuff in a time of terrible scarcity... but hey they're really sexually liberated and not racist at all.\r\n\r\n<b>Inconsistent</b>: High Fantasy (subsisting commune agrarians, feudalism, omnipotent wizards) which also boasts C20th science, somehow. An in-universe history book describes one catastrophe as:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"aerosolizing sufficient steam and particulate matter to trigger acidic rain and sky occlusion over the Somidlats...\"</blockquote></i>\r\nThey have penicillin without an industrial revolution, electric lights before steam. Ordinary C15th cannon are an experimental wunderweapon to them. \r\nMore: most births have some risk (<1%) of being a giant nuclear volcano generator, but the Evil Empire does nothing to control reproduction, and has the parents administer very insecure self-regulation. \r\n\r\n<b>Pretentious portentousness</b>:\r\n<blockquote><i>There passes a time of happiness in your life, which I will not describe to you. It is unimportant. Perhaps you think it wrong that I dwell so much on the horrors, the pain, but pain is what shapes us, after all. We are creatures born of heat and pressure and grinding, ceaseless movement. To be still is to be... not.\r\n</blockquote></i>Of a character which until about 10 pages earlier had been a despised / tolerated frenemy:\r\n<blockquote><i>now your eyes are drawn away from the horror that remains of your mentor, your lover, your friend...</blockquote></i>\r\nI forgive Ada Palmer this style. But 1) she's not that bad; 2) she's aping the sentimentalist C18th, and 3) she has far greater philosophical sense.\r\n\r\n<b>Glib</b>: \r\n<blockquote><i>it turns out that the comm is called Meov, and the man who has stepped forward is Harlas, their headman. \r\nAlso they're pirates.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>Syenite mispronounces vulgar words, inadvertently making them more vulgar, and makes instant friends of half the crew by doing so.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\"lol, applause!\"\r\n\r\n<b>Bad slang</b>: \"rogga\", \"comm\", \"orogeny\" (every time, I thought \"erogenous?\"), really bad interjections (<i>' \"Evil, eating Earth\", you whisper'</i>; '<i>for shit's sake, she stilled a rusting volcano made by a broken obelisk</i>'). The occasional good bit of slang (like \"grits\" for the young rock mages) is smothered in exposition: <i>that's what she is now, an unimportant bit  of rock ready to be polished into usefulness...</i>. Better writers (Atwood or Le Guin or Banks) leave it up to you. Everything is spelled out here.\r\n\r\nThe book gets roundly worse in the second half, with two chapters (16 and 17) full of hollow plot devices and applause lights (Damaya only explores the Main building so she can drive the plot forward when the hollow character Binof arrives, immediately afterwards). Also arguably Innon, there to be objectified and let Jemisin write 'good sex' scenes.\r\n\r\nLots of Representation: polyamory, transgenderism, a dozen skin colours. Of course, fantasy doesn't represent anything, so strictly speaking that's a misnomer. It doesn't matter what the ethnic demographics of your lava-world are, relative to ours; you can have as much or as little typical sexuality etc as you like, any colour can be a minority, <i>as long as it makes sense in that world</i>. Do the choices of identities fit Jemisin's world? Is Tonkee's transgenderism, among feudalism, a personal idiosyncrasy? A hormone thing? A magic thing? We're given no reason for any of the identities she introduces to celebrate. But it mostly doesn't get in the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nJemisin fumbles the \"in a corrupt world, lawful complicity or violent revolution?\" angle. At least in this instalment, there's little acknowledgment that killing an entire city because a handful of people in its government committed atrocities isn't on: '<i>He's not crazy at all, and he never has been</i>' \r\n\"<i>what right do worlds built on oppression and genocide have to exist?</i>\", asks one reviewer. Well, 'worlds' (institutions) don't have rights, people do: and people have a right to not suffer harm, e.g. the harm of having a great big earthquake dropped on you.",

All that remains is clog dancing and macramé. The ability to make judgments, to believe things, is the entire point of having a culture.

But it is the fate of operating systems to become free.</i>” \r\n\r\nIf you’re like me (human?), you need metaphors and binary distinctions to get abstract stuff, and Stephenson has them coming out of his ears, which sometimes leads to a stone-tablet patronising tone*.\r\n<blockquote><i>Disney and Apple/Microsoft are in the same business: short-circuiting laborious, explicit verbal communication with expensively designed interfaces.”)</i></blockquote> \r\n\r\nAn amazing writer, though: he finds program comments \"<i>like the terse mutterings of pilots wrestling with the controls of damaged airplanes.</i>\" In tech, 15 years is a full geological era and a half*, so some of his insights have taken on a sepia hue (e.g. “<i>is [Microsoft] addicted to OS sales in the same way as Apple is to selling hardware? Keep in mind that Apple's ability to monopolize its own hardware supply was once cited, by learned observers, as a great advantage over Microsoft. At the time, it seemed to place them in a much stronger position. In the end, it nearly killed them, and may kill them yet... When things started to go south for Apple, they should have ported their OS to cheap PC hardware. But they didn't. Instead, they tried to make the most of their brilliant hardware, adding new features and expanding the product line. But this only had the effect of making their OS more dependent on these special hardware features, which made it worse for them in the end.  </i>”).

    "review": "Two globish co-dependents of unequal intelligence but equal mawkishness take turns at monologue, for ages and ages. One’s oracular, the other Boswellian, which means that both talk about the nasty past of the oracular one, Zafar. Everyone’s always trying to educate everyone else, without invitation. \n\nTragic, panoptic, and treats big C21st problems – neocolonialism, quant finance, the ineffectiveness of NGOs, the nature of the transnational élite that administers all these things. But also dull, overwritten and clumsily polymathic (characters can be found over-reading, variously, Gödel, Middlemarch, the birth of Bangladesh, the Brit-pop band James). The book is aware of its own pomp – there’s a long discussion of sincerity as virtue and vice, a raging attack on Anglophone Indian literature, and Zafar quotes more and more as he disintegrates, suggesting that the book’s larding of quotations is a knowing prop. But while I don’t know whether it’s Zafar or Rahman that the book’s clumsiness is rooted in, I don’t have to, to know that his conceit of desperate knowledge didn’t take root in me. \n\nI shouldn’t say panoptic: there’s only one woman in this, really, and we don’t see much even of her except as deceiver and appalling vehicle for privilege. Chapter 14’s good – a big bickering, drunken dinner with Pakistani elites, and there are details to admire throughout (Zafar broods over microaggressions, and some of his apercus are sparkling – like his characterisation of maths as “thinking without the encumbrance of knowledge”, or his likening of a good essay to “a good dress – long enough to cover the important bits, short enough to be interesting”). \n\nLast, very superficially: there are no speech marks, and this deadens the dialogue for me; it makes everything look past-tense and snarky. (Ok sure this works incredibly well in <i>Blood Meridian</i>, but only because all the men in that are wholly dead inside). \n\nWill Self minus electricity; Coetzee minus originality and 12-gauge philosophy. Speaking as a pompous generalist and an inveterate over-writer… ",

Hell’s teeth!”). \n\nAdding the generalisation that ‘we swear about what we care about’, she can use known changes in the expressive power of swearwords to cleverly trace the movement of taboos across cultures and over time. (Very broadly: power went from Shit’s precedence to Holy and now back and with more political terms.) Rome’s nasty little sexuality is seen to be the model of a lot of our crap associations; in the Middle Ages vain oaths were criminal while scholars and physicians used ‘cunt’ in textbooks without heat. \n\nIn our time, racial slurs (very young as slurs – only around WWII for their worst malevolence) have taken the biscuit from sex, excrement and God - which you can see as encouraging (if that means we now care about the targets of racial language) - or depressing (if that means we now care more about Race, dividing lines for their own sake). \n\nMohr is full of fact without being trivial; she lets graffiti, court records, and primary quotation damn the damnable – e.g. DH Lawrence’s holy cock-mysticism, the spume of Twitter bigots. \n",

Or you might note their continuing key role in keeping heinous oppression going (particularly as regards women and gays). Better, you might view the act of worship as in fact degrading to the worshipper, or see the epistemology implicit in religious practice as an unhealthy and obstructive stance to the world. (Preventing as it does healing doubt and energetic inquiry; outmoded as it is given the better methods at hand.) \n\nAnyway: Hick of the rearguard talks fairly and at length with a fictional scientistic interlocutor, demonstrating how - if the theist is willing to retreat, ad-hoc, about ten times - scientism actually cannot touch them. \n\nAmusing example: Hick responds to the solid neurological explanation of religious experience by saying that this is all perfectly consistent with electrical induction in the <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/brains/2007/04/spirit_tech.html\">right angular gyrus</a> just <i>enabling us to perceive the spiritual world</i>. I like bullet-biting of this magnitude.

At least his atheist doesn’t convert at the end, as they did in medieval apologetics. \n",

He’s a more relaxed, atheoretical Wallace, with pop music (rather than Art writing) at his core, and technology (rather than general Irony) as the source of his worries about us all. \n\nThis slices through the reflexivity that causes modern confusions, while being mischievously reflexive himself (at one point he tells us that he once lied to an interviewer who had correctly identified Klosterman’s mouthpiece in one of his novels; Klosterman denied that he shared the character’s view in order to preserve a cheap narrative uncertainty for readers of the interview – but, of course, admitting that here undoes that cheap save for we third-order readers). \n\nApplied instance: <blockquote>“<i>We assume that commercials are not just informing us about purchasable products, because that would be crude and ineffective. We’re smarter than that. But that understanding makes us more vulnerable. We’ve become the ideal audience for advertising—consumers who intellectually magnify commercials in order to make them more trenchant and clever than they actually are. Our fluency with the language and motives of the advertiser induces us to create new, better meanings for whatever they show us. We do most of the work for them.</i>”</blockquote> \nTwo quibbles: there is (what I take to be) a lack of ideological care you’d expect of pieces written for <i>Esquire</i> magazine. He doesn’t resolve (as I think DFW mostly does) the tension between a) affirming low culture’s power and unique charms against bullshit classist disparagement, and b) despising its crudest, most conservative common denominators. \n\nWent through it in an hour. \n",

He’s a strict <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/race/#DoRacExiConPhiDeb\">philosophical eliminativist</a>, implying that the harm resulting from reifying race totally outweighs all gains from positive discrimination.

    "review": "Cambridge neuroscientist lets himself go, speculating a bit aimlessly on the meaning and ends of present trends. He goes via Gilgamesh, Swift and Woolf as much as HeLa, Hayflick and Kirkwood. Core evidence-based conclusions are: Life expectancy increases are not slowing down much; dementia is exploding upwards; we know very little about aging and have almost no power over it (but a start has been made – e.g. we know inflammation is important if not the core – and ). The core attitudinal point is to view aging as a disease and death an injustice. Cute (“<i>build a dream, write that novel… have lots of sex</i>”), and it comes from an insider, but not so deep. \n\nI recommend instead <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/dignity.html\">Nick Bostrom</a>(as kaleidoscopic booster), <a href=\"http://bryanappleyard.com/transhumanism-rising/\">Bryan Appleyard</a> (as somewhat sympathetic sceptic) and <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/04/the-case-against-perfection/302927/\">Michael Sandel</a> and <a href=\"https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23461-the-future-of-human-nature/\">Habermas</a> (as non-contemptible bioconservatives). \n\n",

When I won two British comedy awards in 2011, it wasn’t mentioned in any newspapers.

This fails utterly and inspires revolt. \n<blockquote><i>she was one of those intellectual girls... who are unable to see a male soul without wanting to get behind it and shove. We had scarcely arranged the preliminaries before she was checking up on my reading... substituting a thing called 'Types of Ethical THeory'. Nor did she attempt to conceal the fact that this was a mere pipe opener and that there was worse to come.</blockquote></i>\nJeeves, on the other hand, has no programme, he just slips allusions and lyricism into conversation, with at least passable results on Wooster.  \n<blockquote><i>'I shall miss you, Jeeves.'\n'Thank you, sir.'\n'Who was that chap who was always beefing about gazelles?'\n'The poet <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44781/lalla-rookh\">Moore</a>, sir. He complained that he had never nursed a dear gazelle, to glad him with its soft black eye, but when it came to know him well, it was sure to die.'\n'It's the same with me. I am a gazelle short. You don't mind me alluding to you as a gazelle, Jeeves?'\n'Not at all, sir.” \n</blockquote></i>\n<blockquote><i>'Propose, forsooth!

It means roughly \"nuts to you!\" '\n</blockquote></i>\nIndeed, since all the stories but one are told by Wooster, <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Psalms#Psalm_30\">the title of this</a> is down to this strategy.

    "review": "(<i>Credibility note</i>: I went to sociology lectures I wasn’t registered for; that plus this book is all I know. The following thus risks making <i>the</i> mistake of disgruntled undergrads everywhere: assuming that my limited understanding of a field is all the field is. Still:) \r\n\r\nEven that might have exhausted the intellectual benefits. Owing to blameless methodological difficulties (e.g. the 'causal density' of human behaviour, that <a href=\"http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_3_social-science.html\">little experimentation is possible</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect\">Hawthorne effects</a>, low statistical power), those benefits are mostly 1) reminders and details of how social structures hurt people, and 2) some new vocabulary - rather than subterranean insight or predictive progress in the understanding of societies. \r\n\r\n(Kudos to Giddens for this passage: “<i>…is sociology merely a restatement, in abstract jargon, of things we already know? Sociology at its worst can be exactly that…</i>”)\r\n\r\n(1): If you already don’t persecute people out of ignorance, and already know which groups are ill-treated or unlucky (whether or not you ill-treat them), then (1) is already checked off.\r\n\r\n(2): Some of those new words: ‘socialisation’ vs ‘<a href=\"http://www.theory.org.uk/giddens2.htm\">structuration</a>’, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verstehen\">Verstehen oder Erklärung</a>, or the disturbing hypothesis <a href=\"http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/\">stereotype threat</a>, or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_status\">master status</a> of a given society, or the ‘<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_and_latent_functions_and_dysfunctions\">manifest</a>’ vs the ‘<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_and_latent_functions_and_dysfunctions\">latent</a>’ functions of an action. \r\n\r\nSociology seems good at unpicking ‘neoliberal’ delusions (roughly the set of theodicies that say, “Everything bad about society is just individuals making free decisions, so back off”) – but is (<a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2014/03/27/book-review-punk-sociology-by-david-beer/\">usually</a>) poor at following through with the counterpart doubt: wondering if our neat structural explanations are as applicable or explanatory as we like to think. \r\n\r\nInteractionism is one clearly valuable strand, because it's empirical and bottom-up. (It is harder for us to disappear up our own ass with our ear that close to the ground.) Also there's whatever school <a href=\"https://kieranhealy.org/\">Kieran Healy</a> represents - unless, cruel fate, he's the only one.\r\n",

    "review": "Descartes teaches lots of things, but the most relevant is the terrible power of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning\">motivated reasoning</a> to pervert someone - even if the reasoner is hugely intelligent. \r\n\r\nBut not only. Catherine Wilson forced me to think of Descartes as more than a strong mathematician, incomplete scientist, bigoted apriorist and shoddy Analytic. Not least, she wrote <a href=\"http://www.philosophica.ugent.be/fulltexts/76-4.pdf\">this</a>, maybe the brassiest passage I've ever seen in an academic journal:\r\n<blockquote><i>if Descartes had written a Preface to the </i>Meditations<i> that was truthful, faithful to his firmest convictions, and philosophically consistent, the relevant section would have gone something like this:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nI cannot demonstrate the immortality of the human soul, and probably no philosopher can. Immortality is not logically impossible, but it wouldn’t be what you are probably imagining it to be either. Perception, like sensation and emotion, is a registering by our minds of occurrences in our nerves and brain. If our minds endure after death, therefore, as far as the philosopher can tell, they will feel neither pain, nor pleasure, for they will no longerform a composite with our bodies. We will no longer see colours, touch objects, and hear sounds. We will not remember events ofour past lives. We will be numb and inert. Animals will be, as both Aristotle and Lucretius thought, nothing after death, and wehumans will be almost nothing - at most capable of imageless thought and intellectual memory. Of course, we can hope for more than this. Perhaps our bodies will be resurrected and reattached to our minds, so that we are restored to awareness of a world. But this is a matter of faith and cannot be philosophically demonstrated, whereas more important truths such as the excellence of our minds and bodies can be philosophically demonstrated. \r\n\r\nBe that as it may, we are not mere animals. Our language and rationality indicate that we are specially favoured by God. As to whether animals are conscious, I do not know. I avoid speculative philosophy. But everyone can appreciate that animalscannot carry on a conversation, and I seriously doubt that animals reason, for I can show how their behaviour is mediated by the brain to which their sensory organs report, without ascribing reasoning to them. \r\n\r\nThe Fathers of the Church were wrong to scorn the human body asa source of moral corruption and to suggest that it is a shell that we will happily cast off. We use the cerebral representations it forms for purposes as exalted as mathematics, and if we could not understand and trust proofs about the triangle, how should we understand and feel confident about proofs about invisible objects such as God?...Admire God, who has given you a world to study, as well as to experience, and a mind equipped with language and reasoning powers, but leave off worrying about eternal rewards and punishments. \r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOf course Descartes could not have published such a Preface, not in France and not under his own name. Yet it was to communicate this very different message that he offered, without his heart being in the task, to prove the immortality of the soul.\r\n\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nCharitable to say the least, but that's what we owe the very distant.",

Now he worries that science is going to make life too easy – that overcoming human evolution’s horrible legacy issues (e.g. ubiquitous mental illness, moral myopia, unspeakable death) with biotechnology will amount to the death of the soul. (Where the soul is that which thrives on adversity, is real / spiritual / creative, and Takes Responsibility.) \n\nI shouldn’t mock; Fukuyama at least handles this fear secularly and rationally, and his existential claim is not wrong by definition; also, it is interesting to him endorse regulation for once. This is a clear statement of a common (the default?) position on a matter of huge importance.\n\nHowever, his arguments are piss-poor: he argues via 1) using fictional evidence – <i>Brave New World</i> and the <i>Bible</i>; by 2) suggesting, without real evidence, that there are insurmountable trade-offs between longevity and cognition, happiness and creativity, and personality and freedom; and by 3) a truly massive suppressed premise: that things are ok as they are (or, at least, as good as they get). \n\nThe first section, laying out 2002’s cutting edge in life extension, neuropharmacology, and genetic engineering, is fair and good. He accuses bioethicists of being gung-ho shills for Industry, which is interesting, but completely opposed to my experience of them as timid precautionists. \n\nIf you read it, read <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/dignity.html\">Bostrom</a> too.",

    "review": "As a student I was much vexed by analytic philosophy. This was partially sour grapes (because I didn't know enough maths to keep up with some of it), but also partially fair: it isn't what it says it is. Roughly: modern, modest, science-friendly clarification.) \r\n\r\nPreston's polemic is that analytic philosophy isn't real and never was, in the sense that it isn't actually a school, a set of views, or even a methodology. (Instead it's a Anglophone social clique.) The nominally distinctive part of it was, according to Preston, the <i>linguistic thesis</i>: that \"philosophy is wholly or largely a matter of linguistic analysis.\" While some analytics in the canon did think this, most don't and never did. This is dodgy.\r\n\r\nJohn Wisdom is quoted saying that what analytics have in common is their seeking \"new insight into old truths\". Amazingly, that seems about right, and in the plainest possible terms.\r\n\r\nExciting but excessive.",

    "review": "2/5 with an asterisk.* A very useful technique, but with very weak scientific backing (but at least he tried!), and but a fairly bad book. \r\n\r\nThere are classic self-help red flags:\r\n<blockquote><i>My philosophy leads to new concepts in physics and biology... Focusing is now a worldwide network... this can seem insane to the rest of our society. How could new realistic ideas and steps arise from the body? This new institution is changing the atomization of society... Unlocking the wisdom of your body... using the body's own life-centered and inherently positive direction and force...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>'Focusing has been crucial for many bodyworkers. I would hope that it would be more widely integrated within the education of Somatics practitioners.</i> - Don Hanlon Johnson, Professor, California Institute of Integral Studies'\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>The most important rule for a therapist to observe, while helping someone to focus, is to stay out of the focuser's way... [Soon:] Another agitated, self-destructive emotional spiral was beginning and I interrupted her.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>IF DURING THESE INSTRUCTIONS SOMEWHERE YOU HAVE SPENT A LITTLE WHILE SENSING AND TOUCHING AN UNCLEAR HOLISTIC BODY SENSE OF THIS PROBLEM, THEN YOU HAVE FOCUSED.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n...but also things I know to be true and which aren't in the interest of a therapist / self-help guru to say:\r\n<blockquote><i>Why doesn't therapy succeed more often? In the rarer cases when it does succeed, what is it that those patients and therapists do? What is it that the majority fail to do? \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>When the revolution in self-help [democratization] takes place and people do these helpful processes with each other, will professional psychotherapy be unnecessary? \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nIt did take place, we are they; it didn't change much, because most of it is nonsense. I suppose it is cheaper than the old way.\r\n(There is of course the possibility that he's saying them to disarm me.)\r\n\r\nI got incredibly annoyed at him going on about this 'method' for 50 pages without describing it; skip to chapter 4 if you do too. It's roughly\r\n\r\n1) Clear your head\r\n2) Pick one problem and just think about it in general (\"feel it holistically\")\r\n3) Slowly try to find the right words to describe it\r\n4) Switch back between the \"felt sense\" (2) and your description a bunch.\r\n5) Wonder what it's all about. \r\n6) Continue until you feel your attitude towards it change.\r\n\r\nIs this profound? No. Is it crackpot? Also no.\r\n\r\nAlso annoying was his dismissing alternative strategies for handling problems, all of which I sometimes like. He belittles 'belittling the problem' (e.g. reminding yourself that others have it worse - which is both noble and effective); 'analyzing' (he rightly belittles Freudian Analysis, i.e. blaming your present state on the nastiest past event that comes to mind, but <i>as if</i> breaking things into subproblems is always a bad idea); just enduring it (often just works for me); lecturing yourself (often works for me because parts of me want to listen). Why is it so hard for writers like this to concede that some things don't work for some people? (They lose authority I suppose.)\r\n\r\nSurprising that he's a sincere empiricist, or at least trying to be. \r\n<blockquote><i>One reason why research is so important is precisely that it can surprise you and tell you that your subjective convictions are wrong... As hard as it was for me to accept the finding that therapy doesn't do the job, research findings can never hurt you. They move you forward.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.focusing.org/research_basis.html\">This is a list</a> of about 100 studies on the topic (Ctrl+F \"Table 1\"), no doubt with a terrible file-drawer problem. Total n~=500, probably with a lot of duplication. Measures used are a mix of standard boring ones like PFQ and woo boring ones like Gestalt. \r\n\r\nGendlin makes a few specific, testable claims (which is always to be encouraged so allow me to hereby present him with his certificate of falsifiability at worst):\r\n\r\n* \"therapy has better outcomes when clients 'focus\". Too vague, but a few of the studies are nominally about this.\r\n* \"better functioning of the immune system\". Only one mention of immune system in that big chart, for <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8126691\">this n=76 study</a>, no mention of focusing in the abstract at least.\r\n* successful patients (i.e. one-year outcomes) can be predicted from recordings of \"their first two sessions\". This would be good and clean evidence that something real is involved. I think the claim refers to <a href=\"http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/ftp04/nq22908.pdf\">this PhD</a>, n=35. It wasn't exactly cross-validated, shall we say.\r\n\r\nThat review was cursory but tells me enough. (You might think you could just look at clinical practice, 40 years on - which, outside of California, doesn't exactly foreground Gendlin - to get a sense of whether it works as well as he claims. But medicine is too far from a rational system for that.)\r\n\r\nThe core idea is not insane. It's that there is an equivalent of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception\">proprioception</a> for your own emotions, and that you can't change anything about yourself except through it. There's a touch of the old Zen problem to it, that you're trying to describe a nonverbal thing in words. But then, most descriptions aren't descriptions of verbal processes - consider e.g. \"Succulent plants' dark fixation makes them ideal for air quality control in bedrooms\".\r\n\r\nWhat about support from respectable, academic phenomenology? I don't know that there is any such thing. There <i>may</i> be non-propositional, non-procedural knowledge. It wouldn't be surprising - the conscious mind is a relatively small and unskilled thing. It's Gendlin's idea of our apriori and undeluded access to it that's the problem. Gendlin's experiments don't establish the existence or the access. I find it hard to think how to test this, actually. If the epistemology of focusing was real, what would be different about its practitioners? Happiness? Cortisol? Decision speed? I don't know. We are too skilled at deluding ourselves. It would be pretty easy to run an experiment where Gendlinites tried to predict which patients recover, and then check that against normies' predictions.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, this book isn't his strongest face (\"<i>I also want this book to be readable by anyone</i>\"). But I'm not grading on intended audience (and I wasn't encouraged by those no-power, pre-Crisis psychology studies either).\r\n\r\nOpen questions: why should there be any therapy that works in general? Grant that there is bodily knowledge; where is this knowledge stored? The enteric nervous system? Why should introspection work? Theory of mind is for modelling other people so that they can't harm me.\r\n\r\nThis is all probably harmless; people doing Rogerian listening to each other is unlikely to cause any problems (in fact, since it's free, then if the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict\">null hypothesis of talk psychotherapy</a> is true, this might be a social improvement; same benefit without the deadweight); he doesn't advocate withdrawal from treatment (pills are completely absent from the picture, actually). And the opportunity cost of trying this is low, because other self-help is worse. Not for me; maybe for you.\r\n\r\n* Gendlin seems like a very nice man, he's just not the discoverer of the one neat trick to psychiatry. The emphasis (3 chapters) here on helping others and not just yourself in sweet. His acceptance of the need to do science makes it easier to get at him than at other self-helpists - which makes me feel bad about getting at him and not them. (I won't get at them because they're not worth arguing with.)",

    "review": "Amazing as formal experiment - how much physics detail (and physicist detail) can you put in a novel before it falls over? Lots of the pettiness, the indeterminate frustration, and the glory of academic life. A patchwork of details though - but if you like either physics or telling minutiae then you'll like this. The core plot device, communication backwards through time, is a direct consequence of taking the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler%E2%80%93Feynman_absorber_theory\">Wheeler-Feynman</a> interpretation literally.\r\n\r\nBenford is also extremely acute about both Californian and English vice.\r\n<blockquote><i>Perhaps that was the difference between merely thinking about experiments and actually having to do them. It must be harder to believe in serene mathematical beauties when you have dirty hands.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nGrad student maxims:\r\n<blockquote><i>Mother nature is a bitch.\r\nThe probability of a given event is inversely proportional to its desirability.\r\nOne fudged curve is worth a thousand weasel words.\r\nNo analysis is a complete failure - it can always serve as a bad example;\r\nExperience varies directly with the amount of equipment ruined.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>Gordon savored the clammy fullness of the breeze that had tunneled its way up from the Potomac... a welcome relief from California's monotonous excellence.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nBritain's degradation is depicted in terms of particular institutions:\r\n<blockquote><i>The newsagent's a door down proclaimed on a chalkboard the dreadful news that the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> had gone belly-up.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe relationships - highly conventional, highly nuclear - are odd, but feel real because of all the little jokes, gestures, and support they have, and which life has.\r\n<blockquote><i>\"God damn, I love you,\" he said, suddenly grinning. Her smile took on a wry cast. Beneath the flickering street lights she kept her eyes intently on the road, \"That's the trouble with going domestic. You move in with a man and pretty soon, when he says he loves you, you hear underneath it that he's thanking you.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nAnd I can forgive a lot of a C20th novel if it disses Freud:\r\n<blockquote><i>He had oscillated in mood through 1967, not buying Penny's Freud-steeped recipes for repair... \"Isn't it a little </i>obvious<i> to be so hostile to analysis?\" she said once... he felt the clanky, machinelike language was a betrayal, a trap. Psychology had modeled itself after the hard sciences... but they had taken Newtonian clockwork as their example... His intutition told him that no such exterior analysis could capture what rubbed and chafed between them.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe slowly growing apocalypse (though global) is mostly discussed by characters in Britain, so we get a highly amusing contrast between California (1963, pre-apocalypse) and Cambridge (1998, during), where the Americans are all clean and hopeful and the Brits slowly starving and fishing in sewers:\r\n<blockquote><i>Mercury glowed as if alive beneath the filmed water. It gave off a warm, smudged glitter, a thin trapped snake worth a hundred guineas. \"A find! A find!\" Johnny chanted... They queued up to turn in their pint of the silvery stuff to the Hunt Facilitator. In line with current theory, Renfrew noted, social groupings were now facilitated, not led.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe best subplot is probably the reptilian Oxbridge chad reverting to a heavily-armed feudal lord, including harem husbandry, as society breaks down. \r\n<blockquote><i>Peterson calculated that quite enough had been done along the lines of intimidate-the-visitor and decided a gesture of indifference was needed. \"Do you mind if I smoke?\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nNever mind the tachyons; there's some truly far-out notions in this, e.g.\r\n<blockquote><i>Queen Elizabeth had abdicated in favor of her eldest son the previous Christmas and he had chosen to be crowned on his fiftieth birthday, in November.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nAnd indeed reality reasserts itself in the face of this rank authorial whimsy:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Did you hear about the Coronation? They've cancelled preparations [owing to the total breakdown of law and order].\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nI wonder if the ending - the triumph and social ascent of the man who just receives the future signals; the literal fading-away of the team that built the theory and transmitter in conditions of terrible scarcity - is a jab at someone in particular. Here's Renfrew's last word - after succeeding, but never knowing that he has:\r\n<blockquote><i>He was trying a modification of the signal correlator when the lights winked out. Utter blackness rushed in. The distant generator rattled and chugged into silence. It took a long time to feel his way out and into the light. It was a bleak, gray noon, but he did not notice; it was enough to be outside. He could hear no sound from Cambridge at all. The breeze carried a sour tang. No birds. No aircraft. He walked south, towards Grantchester. He look back once at the low square profile of the Cav and in the diffused light he raised a hand to it. He thought of nested universes, onion skin within onion skin... For so long now he had been transfixed by the past. It had deadened him this real world around him. He knew, now, without knowing quite how he knew, that it was forever lost... Rather than feeling despair, he was elated, free. Marjorie lay up ahead, no doubt frightened to be alone. He remembered her preserves on the uncompromising straight shelving, and smiled. They could eat those for some time. Have some easy meals together, as they did in the days before the children. There was really quite a lot ahead to do, when you thought about it.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nAbout a third too long; I honestly think I could edit out a hundred pages and get a great book. Maybe this is 4* even so.",

    "review": "<blockquote><i>structured procrastinator</i>: a person who gets a lot done by [consciously] not doing other [important] things.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis book didn't exactly change my life, but it made me feel better about what I was already doing. (Before, I'd been calling it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist\">slingshot</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia\">akrasia</a>.) \r\n\r\nStructured procrastination is that staple from stand-up comedy where the best way to get yourself to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mktCdixReBA\">tidy your entire house</a> is to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILysMhm8lXs\">sit down to do your taxes</a>.\r\n\r\n: All of my reviews, all of my <a href=\"https://www.gleech.org/\">essays</a> were written in the glow and shadow of other things I should've been doing.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>All procrastinators put off things they have to do. Structured procrastination is the art of making this bad trait work for you. The key idea is that procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely nothing. Procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing; they do marginally useful things, such as gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they find the time. Why does the procrastinator do these things? Because accomplishing these tasks is a way of not doing something more important.\r\n\r\n        If all the procrastinator had left to do was to sharpen some pencils, no force on earth could get him to do it. However, the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult, timely, and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important...\r\n\r\n        Doing those tasks becomes a way of not doing the things higher on the list. With this sort of appropriate task structure, you can become a useful citizen. Indeed, the procrastinator can even acquire, as I have, a reputation for getting a lot done.\r\n\r\n        Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack. They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. But this approach ignores the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation. The few tasks on his list will be, by definition, the most important. And the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is the way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being...\r\n\r\n        The second step in the art of structured procrastination is to pick the right sorts of projects for the top of the list. The ideal projects have two characteristics -- they seem to have clear deadlines (but really don't), and they seem awfully important (but really aren't). Luckily, life abounds with such tasks. At universities, the vast majority of tasks fall into those two categories, and I'm sure the same is true for most other institutions...\r\n\r\n        At this point, the observant reader may feel that structured procrastination requires a certain amount of self-deception, since one is, in effect, constantly perpetrating a pyramid scheme on oneself. Exactly... what could be more noble than using one character flaw to offset the effects of another? \r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWork and study <i>pressurise</i> my life. They give me a structure to defy, a gravity assist. I am happiest laden with obligations, when the set of tasks that is my life flies just out of control. I think the mechanism is this: \r\n\r\n  1. I require a steady stream of variety. \r\n  2. Having a job makes my days closely resemble each other. \r\n  3. Intolerable resentment. \r\n  I am forced to produce creative sparks to satisfy my basic drive. \r\n\r\nSP is related to how great I feel when I don't have to go to a party, to my sadly efficient approach to grades, to how giving work to a busy person is a good way of getting it done quicker, i.e. an implausible linear increase of output with increasing things to do. I read more fiction when doing a stats degree and learn more stats when in work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<b>Antecedents of Perry and me.</b>\r\n\r\nFernando Pessoa: <blockquote><i>        I often wonder what kind of person I would be if I had been protected from the cold wind of fate by the screen of wealth... to reach the tawdry heights of being a good assistant book-keeper in a job that is about as demanding as an afternoon nap and offers a salary that gives me just enough to live on.\r\n        I know that, had that past existed, I would not now be capable of writing these pages, which, though few, I would undoubtedly have only day-dreamed, given more comfortable circumstances. For banality is a form of intelligence, and reality, especially if it is brutish and rough, forms a natural complement to the soul. Much of what I feel and think I owe to my work as a book-keeper since the former exists as a negation of and flight from the latter. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nNietzsche: <blockquote><i>        the struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity... produced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely-strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals... we have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow! And perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and, who knows? The goal to aim at... \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nGeoff Dyer:<blockquote><i>        The best circumstance for writing, I realized... were those in which the world was constantly knocking at your door; in such circumstances, the work you were engaged in generated a kind of pressure, a force to keep the world at bay. Whereas here, on Alonissos, there was nothing to keep at bay, there was no incentive to generate any pressure within the work, and so the surrounding emptiness invaded and dissipated, overwhelmed you with inertia. All you could do was look at the sea and the sky and after a couple of days you could scarcely be bothered to do that.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nZach Weiner: <blockquote><i>        [After months of working only on my main goal] I took on a job doing closed captioning because I found it [made for] an easier time writing. Just something about talking to people and watching weird media made the writing a lot easier. My new theory of self was that you can't write well unless you have a little strife in your life. I worked at the closed captioning job for 4-6 months and by then I was making enough money on the site to responsibly quit my job.\r\n\r\n        The problem was I didn't want to quit my job and have readership fall off because I couldn't write, so my crazy idea was to go back to school. I thought, it'd to be this weird environment, with younger people, and that would be good...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIs this platitudinous? It is possible that the grand narration above is delusional, and that the only actual content here is \"A lot of people work better under pressure\". Don't think so though.\r\n\r\nYMMV. 5/5 if you don't do this already.",

    "review": "Anthology of news from an American newspaper written largely by leftist academics. But at least these selected pieces are actually a fairly low-ideology portrait of shocking events, unreported or begrudgingly reported by mainstream sources. \r\n\r\nIt’s way left of <i>the Guardian </i>and still undeluded. I’d never looked into the Contras scandal which <i>In these Times</i> scooped – if you don’t know, this was that time Reagan-funded murderers imported massive amounts of crack into the US using government money. \r\n\r\nEven the Zizek(!) piece (on 9/11) is low-key, wise, and borne out by history.\r\n<blockquote><i>Now, we are forced to strike back, to deal with real enemies in the real world … but whom to strike? Whatever the response, it will never hit the right target, bringing us full satisfaction. The spectacle of America attacking Afghanistan would be just that: If the greatest power in the world were to destroy one of the poorest countries, where peasants barely survive on barren hills, would this not be the ultimate case of the impotent acting out? Afghanistan is already reduced to rubble, destroyed by continuous war during the past two decades. The impending attack brings to mind the anecdote about the madman who searches for his lost key beneath a street light; asked why he searches there, when he actually lost the key in a dark corner, he answers: “But it is easier to search under strong light!” Is it not the ultimate irony that Kabul already looks like downtown Manhattan?\r\n\r\n The only way to ensure that it will not happen here again is to prevent it from going on anywhere else. America should learn to humbly accept its own vulnerability as part of this world, enacting the punishment of those responsible as a sad duty, not as an exhilarating retaliation. Even though America’s peace was bought by the catastrophes going on elsewhere, the predominant point of view remains that of an innocent gaze confronting unspeakable evil that struck from the Outside. One needs to gather the courage to recognize that the seed of evil is within us too.\r\n</blockquote></i>",

    "review": "Bitter, accusatory poems on Stalinism from a self-described \"European pessimist\" (i.e. in the line of Diogenes, Hobbes, Arnold, Spengler, Schopenhauer). A sensitive man betrayed by the terrible course of communism, he goes in for nihilism:\r\n<blockquote><i>We were hungry for belief \r\nhope fed us human flesh.</blockquote></i> \r\n(This isn't <i>generally</i> what it feels like to change your mind on something important; it rings of deconversion rather than grudging error-correction.)\r\n\r\nMackay had a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/sep/02/guardianobituaries.books\">terrible time of it</a>, he suffered without even getting thrilling hubris or an heroic end. Many canonical artists had unusually hard lives and/or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity_and_mental_illness\">mood disorders</a>. But it's not necessarily that sad people write better. Instead here's what I think happens: audiences do not default to being receptive to others: we need to be woken up to a book, whether by personal recommendation, or shared biographical detail, or some other gimmick. A tragic biography is the most reliable primer. (Witness the <a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/217663/amy-winehouse-and-other-posthumous-sales-booms-by-the-numbers\">death</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_posthumous_number_ones_on_the_UK_Albums_Chart\">bump</a>.) \r\n\r\n(It's not nice to attack the <i>hegemony of the sad</i> in art. 1) They are still good, when they're good; 2) they are often Witnesses, speakers-against-power, and anyone can be crushed by having to do that; 3) leave them some bloody consolation!)\r\n\r\nI would love Mackay's poems to be incredible; I was extremely moved by Mackay's (self-published) <a href=\"http://www.onlineoriginals.com/showitem.asp?itemID=303\">suicide diary</a>. But they're just ok. Of moons, angels, deserts, atomisation, Hendrix. <i>Red Ice</i> was written well before Bosnia (the crowning horror of his life), but it's already overflowing with ruined empathy and snarly emptiness and survivor's guilt. \r\n\r\nAre there great paintings in only black and grey? Well, sort of. Calvary features four times in twenty poems. \r\n<blockquote><i>the mountains are mere hills \r\nthe calvarys are daily and inconspicuous \r\nand we are retreating into closed worlds</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nMackay was trying genocide verse, forty years after <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/adorno/#2\">Adorno</a> and twenty-five after <a href=\"http://rinabeana.com/poemoftheday/index.php/2008/07/27/two-formal-elegies-by-geoffrey-hill/\">Geoffrey Hill</a>. (Does it matter, being <i>late</i> to the worst thing ever? No, but do it right, do it new.) The brute fact of the C20th drives him to <a href=\"http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/holy-wholly-my-own-1987-by-colin-mackay.html\">nostalgia</a> and lairy isolation \r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n[I said] I will be me for the hell of it\r\n[he said] you working-class tory\r\nyou aren't worth a shit\r\n</blockquote></i> \r\n\r\nSo the poems are chaste, romanticism with the innocent wonder ripped out; unleavened except for his spurious racial memory of everything being ok, once. (Wordsworth at Katyn. I do not think highly of Wordsworth.) The long title poem has automatic force, being as it is about the gulags and the shame of apologism (Lenin and Stalin (and Trotsky and...)). But it's also uncompressed, clumsy with rage (\"<i>stop these follies of the human race</i>!\"). It condemns by MacDiarmid and Sartre by name, which is rare and ok. On hypocrisy, silence on Soviet abuses in favour of focusing on lesser Western crimes:</li>\r\n <blockquote>\r\n  [They told me] \r\n  \"<i>Find something in your own hemisphere!\" \r\n  to salve my Commie conscience with, to express solidarity with. \r\n  (If only there was someone I could express solidarity with...)\r\n </blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one poem that really gets somewhere: \"<a href=\"http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/phantoms-1987-by-colin-mckay.html\">Phantoms</a>\", a fast, vocal, twisted/triumphant repudiation of war and hippies alike. \r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nOne night I rose to count myself and found\r\nthat I was loose change from the age of plenty,\r\nlittle piles of sweaty much-handled hope,\r\npromissary thinknotes tissue-thin\r\ndevalued below use,\r\nand I cried then, A dream! a dream!\r\nI am tired of too much reality!\r\n...And I woke,\r\nand stood before my window,\r\nand looked to the West and saw\r\na giant city that was lit with despair\r\nthat stank futility,\r\nand looked to the East and saw\r\na barbed-wire labour camp reeking\r\nof death, dictators...\r\n\r\nO television pop world\r\nof toothpaste and handsome people!\r\nI see I am now a Mirage in your eyes,\r\nan Eagle, a Falcon, a Mig 23, 25, 27,\r\na Tupolev, a Tornado, a Sukhoi, bigger\r\nbetter, deadlier armed than before,\r\nswingwinged and shining and lethal,\r\nwhen in my own sad fantasy fact I am sitting\r\nslumped in sweaty shirt and pants after a night\r\nspent strafing the emotions,\r\nstaring at a sunlit breakfast table\r\nwith blank and stupid face.\r\nAnd I turned from the place of aerials\r\nwhere the screech-hawks of power sit perched\r\nand wandered off, away, far away,\r\ndown a long corridor crying for\r\nGod to return to the breast of his image\r\nthat is lonely, O so lonely, and wandering lost\r\nacross the plain, hammered on by the hooves\r\nof daemon horses where\r\nGod's jackass\r\nbray.\r\n\r\nAnd though they could hold the thought that lights the beauty of the stars\r\nand leap forward through death\r\nand through the doors of oblivion\r\nthere between eternity and the night and the sea\r\nwhere Blake and Shakespeare and all the prophets\r\nare unread and need not be read -\r\n                          still they grin, grin.\r\n\r\nNo friends, I am not mad,\r\nfor I have seen them on the clear horizon,\r\nghosts of television wars lifelong,\r\nof Algeria, of Indochina, of Ulster\r\nand Ogaden, Sinai and Afghanistan.\r\nI have seen migrations of silver planes\r\nwith wing stars red and white\r\ncrapping napalm, crapping bombs\r\nhigh explosive, nuclear, thermo-nuclear, biological.\r\nAnd I with my tin six-guns\r\nready to be a hero\r\nfiring off caps against such missiles\r\nthat some bored but competent officer in the Urals\r\nwill launch with a button\r\nblasting philosophy and idealism\r\nand eternal consciousness to hell\r\nin four easy minutes...\r\n\r\nLady be mine, while there is still time,\r\nin a country made for two.\r\nWe can find its door if we know no more\r\nthan any man and woman do.\r\nBefore falls the fire from the blue blue sky\r\non some lunatic's launching day,\r\nlady be mine, O lady be mine,\r\nlet's fuck our lives away.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nAnd \"<a href=\"http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/holy-wholly-my-own-1987-by-colin-mackay.html\">Holy, Wholly My Own</a>\" is admirable Golden Age pap. I want to call him 'Nightwatchman of the ex-socialist Scotch soul', but I don't know if that's a sentimental response to the poor bastard and not the poor bastard's work at all. \r\n\r\nAll that said: I'm still thinking about this book (or this man) five years later. Plus one.",

    "review": "Class act: cyberpunk without cheap gothic neon and lolspeak; noir without cartoonish conventions. A meditation on identity and consent via sex and violence. Genuinely. The Scene: Consciousness can be up- and downloaded. In this world, if you are rich enough, <i>you do not die. </i>If you're richer than that, you get uploaded into a young clone of yourself - otherwise you take whatever marginalised corpse is going and adjust your sense of self to fit. \r\n\r\nHe picks out implications brilliantly (e.g. what happens to celebrity culture?). The inevitable neologisms are excellent, intensely suggestive of the new culture's inner life: death is just \"storage\"; bodies are just \"sleeves\" and to be reincarnated is to be \"sleeved\"; a plasma gun is a \"sunjet\". Murder is just \"organic damage\". Catholics are (once again) the world's underclass - unable to travel interstellar because it involves casual storage (suicide) and resleeving (heresy), and killed with near-impunity because they alone cannot <i>testify at their own murder trials</i>. Cartoonish moments: our anti-hero Takeshi Kovacs is attacked or apprehended <b><i>7</i></b>times in the first 150 pages.) People transition gender with regularity. Morgan makes a bold essentialist statement, which is <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9620515\">somewhat</a> backed-up: \r\n<blockquote><i>To be a woman was a sensory experience beyond the male... To a man, skin was a barrier. To a woman it was an organ of contact. That had its disadvantages</span>.\r\n</blockquote></i> (Kovacs is tortured, horrifically, as a woman.) Advertising can be beamed obtrusively into your mind. The UN has become a Shady Galactic Empire. It is strongly suggested - not least by our trained-psychopath protagonist - that this transhuman society is more psychopathic, owing to the lower stakes of violence, injury, and taboo-breaking. Gritty but not just gratuitous. Better than Gibson. \r\n",

    "review": "Raising up great obscure things is one of the main points of having academics around. However, half the poets in this actually refused to be segregated in their lifetime (that is, refused to be anthologised as women, or at all). Dowson is candid about this, and half the book is just suggestive little biographies as a result. \n\nShe is shackled to the humanities' chaste, hyper-qualified prose (\"<i>I have tried to illustrate that through their interrogations of national and international affairs, their preoccupations with cultural politics and their experiments with language and form... rejects the language of centrality and dominance</i>...\") and their fear of judgment / love of equivocation (\"<i>If consensus over a 'good poem' is neither desirable nor possible, then value is largely determined by context</i>...\"), it's not exactly hateful. \n\nWhether through Dowson's bias or the necessities of the time, these poets are even more independent than their male counterparts. Of those selected, Stevie Smith and <a href=\"http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.com/2013/06/prelude-1935-by-edith-sitwell.html\">Edith Sitwell</a> are already fully reclaimed as the canonical boss ladies they are. Two big oversights of mine: Naomi Mitchison and Sylvia Townshend Warner. Mitchison is amazing - wise when wounded, droll and passionate, politicised but never journalistic: check out \"<a href=\"http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.com/2013/06/to-some-young-communists-from-older.html\">To Some Young Communists</a>\", \"<a href=\"http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.com/2013/06/woman-alone-1935-by-naomi-mitchison.html\">Woman Alone</a>\", \"<a href=\"http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.com/2013/06/old-love-and-new-love-1934-by-naomi.html\">Old Love and New Love</a>\". Warner is both <a href=\"http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.com/2013/06/port-bou-1933-by-sylvia-townshend-warner.html\">blunt</a> and <a href=\"http://troublingadvocacy.blogspot.com/2013/06/drawing-you-heavy-with-sleep-1932-by.html\">metaphysical</a>. (Others are just passable. Vita Sackville-West's are surprisingly poor, in fact.

The pill itself silently self-destructing in a tiny inward burst, a polymer implosion, discreet and precise and considerate.

There is this section, which is an early prediction of what would happen to British sharecroppers in the coming centuries:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nYour sheep […] that commonly are so meek and so little, now, as I hear, they have become so greedy and fierce that they devour men themselves. They devastate and depopulate fields, houses and towns. For in whatever parts of the land sheep yield the finest and thus the most expensive wool, there the nobility and gentry, yes, and even some abbots though otherwise holy men, are not content with the old rents that the land yielded to their predecessors. Living in idleness and luxury without doing society any good no longer satisfies them; they have to do positive evil. For they leave no land free for the plough: they enclose every acre for pasture; they destroy houses and abolish towns, keeping only the churches – and those for sheep-barns.\r\n</blockquote></i>",

    "review": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson#Bibliography\">Spot the odd one out</a>: Franklin, Einstein, da Vinci, Kissinger, Jobs. (Trick question! there's two odds out: the first three had huge positive effects on science and society; while Jobs' and Kissinger's impact on the world is respectively \"eh?\" and \"catastrophic\".)\r\n\r\nI don't really understand what people see in Jobs, \"the most beloved billionaire\". He was a turd to just about everyone he met from the age of about 12. \r\n<blockquote><i>in the middle of seventh grade he gave his parents an ultimatum. 'I insisted they put me in a different school'. Financially this was a tough demand; his parent were barely making ends meet, but by this point there was little doubt that they would eventually bend to his will. 'When they resisted, I told them I would just quit going to school if I had to go back...'</blockquote></i>\r\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak\">Some</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson\">of those</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive\">people</a> happened to be brilliant, and responded fairly well to being treated like dirt. How much credit does this omnidickery deserve? (I've been told I'm missing the value of management skills, gumption, motivational speaking. OK, then be clear it was this and not innovation, not engineering, not design. Kottke: \"<i>Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person.</i>\". <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110612071502/http://www.woz.org/letters/general/91.html\">Also the thief.</a>) \r\n\r\nIn the absence of Jobs, it's hard to see it taking much longer than a couple of years for someone to introduce nice personal computers, computer fonts, portable MP3, heartfelt CGI, or omnisurveillance bricks. And maybe those others wouldn't charge through the nose. Catch the ring of pure mania here:\r\n<blockquote><i>'If I had never dropped in on that single [calligraphy] course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nI suppose the evidence in favour of him being talented (and not just being lucky and dominating some talented people) is the string of successes (Apple, NeXT, Pixar, Apple). Not a huge sample size, but big in context.\r\n\r\nI now have lots of questions, none of which Isaacson raises or settles. (In this regard it's much shallower than either his Einstein or Kissinger books.):\r\n\r\n* Could we have gotten the expensive gizmos without all the abuse?\r\n\r\n* What <b>was</b> the net effect of his life? \r\nMillions of pretty objects \r\nminus abandoning a child \r\nminus hundreds of petty sneers and little brutalities\r\nminus <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides\">30 suicides</a> ... \r\nI don't see how to do this. People like Design, sure, but how much?\r\n\r\n* His personal philosophy seems straightforwardly terrible, all the worst of kneejerk Sixties exoticism. Intuition over reason (\"<i>more powerful than intellect</i>\"), AND will over sympathy, AND <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924574/\">nature over science</a>, AND post-truth (\"[Jobs'] <i>reality distortion field was a confounding melange of charismatic rhetoric, indomitable will, and eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand.</i>\") What's the point of being a 'spiritual being' if you're still a dick afterward?\r\n\r\n* Macs are highly underpowered for their price. In theory, this represents a grave loss of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus\">consumer surplus</a>; that is, it loses the point of an economy. But I can't just say that, because people queue up for this stuff. Either they're all exquisite aesthetes who <i>gain</i> surplus by looking at their device during those long extra minutes it takes to finish processing, or the social cachet compensates. I don't have a clear idea of how to judge surplus when computers are not about computing.\r\n\r\n* Your view of Gates vs Jobs is very telling. One is uncool and compromising, but has saved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/14/bill-gates-philanthropy-warren-buffett-vaccines-infant-mortality\">many millions of lives</a>; the other is cool and uncompromising, but, after reading Isaacson, it would not surprise me to hear that none of Jobs' $3.3bn went on philanthropy (it might have been anonymous).\r\n\r\n* Do we <i>need</i> reality distorters? Must we be led into greatness by visionary liars and rogues? (Musk has a bit of this too.)\r\n<blockquote><i>\"If you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told him 'Pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are.\"</blockquote></i> Sure is no way that attitude could ever do any harm. I suppose I should just be grateful he stayed out of politics.\r\n\r\nWasn't sure what to rate the book, since it is mostly clear about a dubious subject. Isaacson often stumbles into the Distortion Field \r\n<blockquote>\"<i>'I think I might have headed to New York if I didn't go to college', [Jobs] recalled, musing on how different his world - and perhaps all of ours - might have been...\"</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nbut <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/09/steve-jobs-worlds-greatest-phi.html\">a bit less than usual</a>.",

    "review": "A beautiful portrait of pragmatism vs idealism, colonialism and collaboration, surveillance culture vs everything, the possibility of deep translation, the beauty and gaucheness of trade, and the ultimate fate of civilisations.\r\n<blockquote><i>Programming went back to the beginning of time. It was a little like the midden out back of his father's castle… There were programs here written five thousand years ago, before Humankind ever left Earth. The wonder of it — the horror of it… down at the very bottom of it was a little program that ran a counter. Second by second, the Qeng Ho counted from the instant that a human had first set foot on Old Earth’s moon. But if you looked at it still more closely… the starting instant was actually about fifteen million seconds later, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time\">0-second</a> of one of Humankind’s first computer operating systems…\r\n\r\n“We should rewrite it all,” said Pham.\r\n\r\n“It’s been done,” said Sura.\r\n\r\n“It’s been tried,” corrected Bret…“You and a thousand friends would have to work for a century or so to reproduce it… And guess what—even if you did, by the time you finished, you’d have your own set of inconsistencies...”\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n    Vinge's great skill is in drawing out sick tragic tension for hundreds of pages, driving the reader on to ever more complex injustices, until... The smooth-talking fascist antagonists are a bit too simple, a bit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Harkonnen\">Harkonnen</a>; their mind-raping slavery, their inversion of justice by lying perfectly, their flat-toned planning of atrocities:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"At which time, we'll feed them the story of our noble effort to limit the genocide.\" Ritser smiled, intrigued by the challenge. \"I like it.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nYou are made to wait 500 pages for a comeuppance. The \"Focused\", the mindwiped slaves are extremely creepy; weaponised savants (see Ada Palmer's set-sets for a less straightforward treatment of human computers). \r\n\r\nPham Nuwen, the great programmer-statesman, is far more interesting here than in the first book. He stands out in a large cast of interesting characters, all laying down schemes and intrigues with at minimum 20 years until payoff (at maximum 2000 years). Not ordinary, but not unrealistic; there have been dozens like him, possessed of or by the force that drives Napoleon off his island, Washington over the river, Alexander everywhere. He is a psychopath:\r\n<blockquote><i>The [armed fascists] might try to chase him around in here. That would be fun; Nau's goons would find just how dangerous their tunnels had become...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe evolutionary role of such people - both the fearless hero, Nuwen, and the bloodthirsty predator, Nau - is not handled explicitly, but Pham is held up as a paragon.\r\n\r\nThe arachnid aliens are much better than the hivehounds of the last book: Vinge and his translator characters' anthropomorphisations (or, rather, personalisations) are successful. Though maybe I'm just biased because the Spiders are shown going through their Information Revolution rather than their Pre-Renaissance period. It shows the deep connection between lack of economic growth, lack of intellectual growth and lack of social progress. The great scientist Sherkaner is also the one to challenge his society's sexual oppression. (\"<i>Either way, the cycles were shattered forever</i>\") The \"counterlurk\" is the Enlightenment. It's an exquisite portrait of the great promise and risk of a technological society; you get the end of hunger and disease, you get spaceflight, but you also get nuclear standoffs.\r\n\r\n    There are wonderful symmetries between the Spiders and humans: they each have odd, distended sleep cycles (the humans going into cryogenic suspension most of the time, the Spiders hibernating centuries until the sun reignites). There's also the Sura/Pham, Qiwi / Ezr, and Victory/Sherkaner pairings, the actual beauty of complementing another, of power couples with aims beyond their own power. \r\n\r\nThe title looks clumsy but isn't: it refers to a very large thought, that decentralising a system is the only way to make it last; that space is not only a cold and hostile place, it is also the way to break the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#It_is_the_nature_of_intelligent_life_to_destroy_itself\">terrible forces</a> that might work against mere interplanetary civilisations:\r\n<blockquote><i>Pham would get their localizers in return for decent medical science. Both sides would benefit enormously. Magnate Larson would live a few extra centuries. If he was lucky, the current cycle of his civilization would outlive him. But a thousand years from now, when Larson was dust, when his civilization had fallen as the planetbound inevitably did—a thousand years from now, Pham and the Qeng Ho would still be flying between the stars. And they would still have the Larson localizers... \r\n\r\n\"If you accept the trade I'm hoping for, you will live just as many years as I. But I am Qeng Ho. I sleep decades between the stars. You Customer civilizations are ephemera to us.\"</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nOne unintentional detail: the \"huds\" that all the human characters depend are I think just Google Glass. \r\n\r\nStayed up late to finish it. Maybe 5/5, will re-read in a while and see.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHow does it do as Serious science fiction?\r\n\r\n<i>    Social development</i>: all three societies depicted are very distinct and have believable economies, genderings, .  The Qeng Ho - the empire without a capital, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League\">force without an army</a> - are a lovely depiction of the humanistic and progressive side of trade. The Emergents are maybe a little too simple, too feudal and dastardly.\r\n\r\n<i>    Software development</i>: Fantastic. Central to the plot (titanic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruft\">cruft</a> as feature), with a subtle twist on the horror of legacy systems: an entire multi-planet civilisation is shown collapsing because its software is too fucking crufty to live. (That might sound ridiculous, but I promise you I see this story in miniature everywhere at my work.) No one does it better.\r\n\r\n<i> Actual Science</i>: Lots, with a breathless romp through all of C20th physics and engineering - though there's also a magic antigrav ore.\r\n\r\n",

    "review": "Engrossing, a great charitable reconstruction of a terrible age. Besides the subtle portrayal of the latent Reformation revolution, there's also a far more important upheaval: the rise of brilliant laymen and potent commoners (e.g. More and Cromwell), that is, the beginning of the end of feudalism.\r\n\r\nNever been very interested in the Tudors. Henry is fickle and narcissistic even compared to other early Modern monarchs, and Anne is a boring climber. He appeared to set off a revolution for no better reason than he was too sexist to accept a female heir. Mantel shows how Henry, Anne and Katherine are a microcosm of their time - <i>Mother Church vs the nationalism-Protestantism complex</i>, and England slowly tearing itself away from former to latter. The first Brexit.\r\n\r\nIt's an imperfect model - Henry still burns un-Catholic books and men, and Luther and Tyndale don't support the shady divorce (against their own interests). A mixture of lust, opportunism, influence from competent rebels (Cromwell, Cranmer)?\r\n\r\n\r\nMost characters are portrayed as pragmatic and modern, prayer aside. They know most relics are bogus, that the \"medicine\" of the day is hazardous, that the Church's decisions are deeply contingent and political, and they mock the superstitious lord who believes in ghosts. This is probably going too far, but it makes for great fiction.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of More vs Cromwell is the reverse of that in <i>A Man for All Seasons</i>: here Cromwell is a rational, catholic, and empathetic gent, while More is a scary authoritarian fundamentalist, closer to a Daesh jihadi than Rowan Williams.\r\n<blockquote><i>    [Cromwell] can’t imagine himself reading [the Bible] to his household; he is not, like Thomas More, some sort of failed priest, a frustrated preacher. He never sees More, a star in another firmament, who acknowledges him with a grim nod - without wanting to ask him, what’s wrong with you? Or what’s wrong with me? Why does everything you know, and everything you have learnt, confirm you in what you have believed before? Whereas in my case, what I grew up with, and what I thought I believed, is chipped away, a little and a little, a fragment then a piece and then a piece more. With every month that passes, the corners are knocked off the certainties of this world: and the next world too.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n\r\nMantel has a funny way of letting her grammar show that Cromwell is The Man - she'll use \"<i>he</i>\" to mark him, even when this breaks the normal \"pronouns refer to the most recent subject of that gender\" convention. This is disorienting, but I appreciate the effect.\r\n\r\nI was recently baffled by this sentence, from a contemporary American evangelical: \"<i>I was baptised Catholic before I became a Christian</i>.\" The violence of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation is the nastiest evidence of the power and horror of the narcissism of small differences.\r\n\r\n\r\nI liked the book recommendations, the 16th Century equivalents of discussions on here. It is <i>so</i> hard to know, from 500 years away, what's worth reading. Though I suppose the real C16th dross is dead, all out of print, unarchived, unextant. For instance:\r\n<blockquote><i>Castiglione says that everything that can be understood by men can be understood by women, that their apprehension is the same, their faculties, no doubt their loves and hates.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThis bit was funny: \r\n<blockquote><i>When the last treason act was made, no one could circulate their words in a printed book or bill, because printed books were not thought of. He feels a moment of jealousy towards the dead, to those who served kings in slower times than these; now a days the  products  of  some  bought  or  poisoned  brain  can  be  disseminated through Europe in a month.<blockquote><i>\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nHe's talking about a time with ~<a href=\"https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/media/1771/broadberry-teaching-1.pdf\">0.1%</a> annual growth, starting from very little; where new books per year was still in the three digits; where new actual insights per year was probably lower, where it takes an entire month and ~thousands of pounds for one troll to even partially foul a discussion.",

    "review": "    Casual, brief and witty theoretical economics. Actually a unification of economics, political science, and this <i>other thing</i>. \r\n\r\nThe prose is deceptively plain, like say Anscombe. There's basically no data, it's all intuition pumps. (But I share most of his intuitions, which surprised me.)        \r\n\r\nSome key premises:\r\n* Nonmarket forces matter.        \r\n* <i>Dissent helps us.</i> It is extremely rich data for anyone who cares about doing good work, and so lasting.        \r\n* If there were only rational (critical and disloyal) customers, the economy would collapse.        \r\n* Exit (market pressure) and Voice (nonmarket pressure). \r\n* (TODO (...) )\r\n\r\nI've never seen such a clear analysis of nonmarket forces - and since I find them ugly and hopeless traps for activists, it's good to be challenged.        \r\n\r\nHe cracks open a massive neglected topic: we had studied <i>macroeconomic slack</i> (depressions, where your whole system is suddenly sluggish and unresponsive) extensively, but not microeconomic slack - Why don't firms maximise output, in healthy macro regimes? Because they're made of individuals who don't? Because of internal conflict requiring suboptimal compromises? Because it serves a latent function?        \r\n\r\nThere's also a surprising focus on social / personal decay - the idea that our new productive power allows for an unprecedented range of decadence, failures, mutation load... There's certainly <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/article/generational-wealth-why-do-70-of-families-lose-their-wealth-in-the-2nd-generation-cm1039671\">some evidence for that</a>. But also selection-as-repair and post-traumatic growth:\r\n<blockquote><i>        Firms and other organisations are conceived to be permanently and randomly subjected to decline and decay. This radical pessimism, which views decay as an ever-present force constantly on the attack, generates its own cure; for as long as decay is hardly in undisputed command at all times, it is likely that the very process of decline activates certain counter-forces.        \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nRead it slowly. I found it really clear, but I don't know if that's because I'm already fairly grounded in economics.        \r\n\r\nHe has a touching pride in political science, in a 1950s Apollonian way, and much of this criticises economists' costly bias in favour of exit:\r\n<blockquote><i>   I hope to demonstrate to political scientists the usefulness of economic concepts </i>and to economists the usefulness of political concepts<i>. This reciprocity has been lacking in recent interdisciplinary work as economists have claimed that the concepts developed for the purpose of analyzing phenomena of scarcity and resource allocation can be successfully used for explaining political phenomena as diverse as power, democracy and nationalism. They have thus succeeded in occupying large portions of the neighbouring discipline.</blockquote></i>\r\nHas the field since done much to vindicate this pride?\r\n\r\nThe best argument against Exit, which I usually favour, is that it <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZQG9cwKbct2LtmL3p/evaporative-cooling-of-group-beliefs\">speeds up and deepens</a> a group's decay: the people who get sick of drama and then leave are likely to be the more thoughtful and virtuous. \r\n\r\nWorth serious study, but if all you take from this review is taking both market and nonmarket forces seriously, and thinking about when to use each, then it's still likely to be some help.",

    "review": "All the classic contradictions - <i>kawaii</i> and banality, sullen obesiance and batshit intensity, <i>mono no aware</i> and sexual frustration.\r\n\r\nThere are five great stories (“<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Screen\">Hell Screen</a>”, '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanshir%C5%8D_(novel)\">Sanshirō</a>', “<a href=\"http://www1.udel.edu/History-old/figal/hist371/assets/pdfs/or4.pdf\">American Hijiki</a>”, “<a href=\"https://granta.com/pink/\">Pink</a>”, “Mr. English”) and 10 or so enjoyable squibs (out of around 40). There aren't many great sentences, but greatness doesn't strictly need em.\r\n<blockquote><i>spinning slowly all in unison, and Naomi found herself joining them, looking up into the sky just as she had before, but this time she felt she was falling, and...perhaps... they could go back to before they'd twisted their bodies in wicked prayer and find some other way to free themselves from a world become a living hell, and so she vowed that once they'd wound the world back a full nineteen years, they would take it in their hands again and make it theirs at last; on and on she spun, every revolution a prayer in reverse.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nConspicuous by its absence is Shōwa fascism* - there are no positive or negative references, nor (modern German-style) defensive rightful disownment. The war is there, the terrible firestorms, the terrible hunger; but nothing of the cult (a <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/the-zen-ideas-that-propelled-japan-s-young-kamikaze-pilots\">death cult</a>, king cult, Prussia cult, and race cult) that caused them. There is a little bit of Edo totalitarianism (a lord having a maiden burned alive to render a painting of hell more realistic) at least. \r\n\r\nThat said, one of the great achievements of 'American Hijiki' is to show how resentment and insularity can come from other sources than <i>hibakusha</i> trauma or psychotic Imperial pique. \r\n<blockquote><i>no Japanese can understand it, probably, if he's not my age. No Japanese who can have an ordinary conversation with an American, who can go to America and have Americans all around him without going crazy, who can see an American enter his field of vision and feel no need to brace himself, who can speak English without embarrassment, who condemns Americans, who applauds Americans, no Japanese like this can understand... what I have is an incurable disease, the Great American Allergy.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThe allure and/or horror of Western things (booze, books, bodies) features in maybe half of these. It is very common for the stories to end on an inconclusive, ambiguous, middle-distance-staring notes.\r\n\r\nI continue to see little in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima\">Mishima</a>'s lascivious, sadistic honour, though I suppose I should thus admire the portrayal of an alien outlook, which might well have overtaken the liberal-ironic-rationalist one. But Akutagawa does that better. In general I didn't see much correlation between eminence and quality (though this judgment is from behind that thick screen, translation).\r\n\r\nOnly one piece, 'Same as Always' (about harming your child) stands for Japan's powerful, distinctive kind of horror.\r\n\r\nThe Hiroshima piece is surprisingly flat, journalistic. I've cried at exhibits about the bombs before, so it ain't me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI liked Murakami's introduction, where he admits hostility to, and ignorance of, modern Japanese fiction:\r\n<blockquote><i> for a long while I was convinced that, with a few exceptions, early modern and contemporary Japanese literature was simply boring. There were many reasons for this, but foremost among them may be that the novels and stories we were assigned to read in school were pretty bad. My “I-novel allergy” was also quite strong back then (these days, to be sure, it has become less intense), and since you can’t hope either to make your way through or to understand modern Japanese literature if you’re going to avoid its constitutional predisposition to producing “I novels,” I made a conscious effort while young to avoid getting anywhere near Japanese literature.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nthough both of his included stories are kind of dull, unaffecting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* In a sense, Imperial Japan was too fascist to be fascist, since \"fascism\" was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statism_in_Sh%C5%8Dwa_Japan#Comparisons_with_European_fascism\">a filthy European idea</a>.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRanked:\r\n\r\n•  “Hell Screen” by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa\r\n•  'Sanshirō' by Natsume Sōseki\r\n• “American Hijiki” by Akiyuki Nosaka\r\n•  “Pink” by Tomoyuki Hoshino\r\n• “Mr. English” by Keita Genji\r\n\r\n•  “In the Box” by Taeko Kōno\r\n•  “Remaining Flowers” by Kenji Nakagami\r\n•  “Hiyoriyama” by Kazumi Saeki\r\n•  “Closet LLB” by Kōji Uno\r\n•  “The Story of Tomoda and Matsunaga” by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki\r\n•  “Filling Up with Sugar” by Yūten Sawanishi\r\n•  “The Silver Fifty-sen Pieces” by Yasunari Kawabata\r\n•  “The Tale of the House of Physics” by Yōko Ogawa\r\n•  “Hiroshima, City of Doom” by Yōko Ōta\r\n•  “Shoulder-Top Secretary” by Shin'ichi Hoshi\r\n•  “Cambridge Circus\" by Motoyuki Shibata\r\n•  “Peaches” by Abe Akira\r\n•  “UFO in Kushiro” by Haruki Murakami\r\n\r\nBelow the cut:\r\n\r\n•  “Unforgettable People” by Doppo Kunikida\r\n•  “The Last Testament of Okitsu Yagoemon” by Ōgai Mori\r\n•  “The Great Earthquake” by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa\r\n•  “Patriotism” by Yukio Mishima\r\n•  “Same as Always” by Yūya Satō\r\n•  “Bee Honey” by Banana Yoshimoto\r\n•  “Dreams of Love, Etc.” by Mieko Kawakami\r\n•  “The Smile of a Mountain Witch” by Minako Ohba\r\n•  “A Bond for Two Lifetimes—Gleanings” by Fumiko Enchi\r\n•  “Planting” by Aoko Matsuda\r\n•  “Flames” by Yūko Tsushima\r\n•  “The 1963/1982 Girl from Ipanema” by Haruki Murakami\r\n•  “Factory Town” by Minoru Betsuyaku\r\n•  “Insects” by Yūichi Seirai\r\n•  “Kudan” by Hyakken Uchida\r\n•  “Behind the Prison” by Kafū Nagai",

    "review": "It's difficult to explain ok. What looks like tasteless idiocy - or, not much better, tastelessly ironic tasteless idiocy - is actually a new, hilarious literary style. I hate Twitter, but use it for this.\n\n'dril' is a self-aware idiot, a boastful masochist, a fanboy, a shill, a disgusting but hapless man. He graduated high school <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dril/status/353376007077625857\">in 2005</a> but also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dril/status/326386680015757312?lang=en\">has grandchildren</a>. He can't spell very well but he breaks out ten-dollar words quite often. That is: he is Everyman, online.\n\nHe thinks he's a social critic but he's also an open shill (and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Oz\">this is not</a> <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/3kv5k3/why-its-so-funny-that-paul-joseph-watson-is-flogging-shonky-brain-pills\">unheard of</a>). His mix of self-regard and incompetence is done better than Ignatius in <i>Confederacy of Dunces</i>.\n\nYou can get a sense of what people see in him through all the surprisingly apt applications: the prolific <a href=\"\">tagging of completely different philosophers</a>, <a href=\"http://peteseeger.tumblr.com/post/152472315268/us-presidents-as-dril-tweets\">US presidents</a>, <a href=\"http://clarabeau.tumblr.com/post/144841412202/famous-romans-as-dril-tweets\">Romans</a>, <a href=\"https://tobermoriansass.tumblr.com/image/175342624166\">Christian denominations</a>.\n\nMissing from this book is the nastier strand of the project, where he resurrects <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ultimatebitch/status/2212199778\">ten-year-old</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dril/status/1046153485111066624\">tweets</a> by real accounts with impressively stupid names which accidentally share the aesthetic. (He mostly targets inactive accounts, though.)\n\nIt's weird to pay for a book which is both free and dreadful (and <a href=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/722/406/b73.png\">lacks some good roughhousing</a>). But everything here is weird.",

Obviously the philosophy (ethical egoism + logical word salad) is toxic (and there's that sex scene...), but it works fine as a trashy yarn, the reader's equivalent of moshing to Rage Against the Machine.\r\n\r\nThere is exactly one good idea in it: the villain, Ellsworth Toohey is a fake socialist, a grand demagogue, a wolf in sheep's ideology. Because he's actually one of her Übermenschen - a brutal, self-actualised spirit just using socialism - he's thus a Worthy Opponent for her pet mavericks. His role in the book is risibly didactic: \"<i>Yes, fine, my heroes are assholes</i>,\" Rand says, \"<i>but look how much worse they are when they </i>pretend<i> to be good</i>!\"",

    "review": "Card is <i>obsessed</i> with family; <spoiler>the happy ever after involves giving a mother of six another six children</spoiler>. \n<blockquote><i>It was Plikt, the good Lutheran, who taught Valentine to conceive of Ender’s life in religious terms; the powerful stability of her family life and the miracle of each of her five children combined to instill in her the emotions, if not the doctrines, of faith.</i></blockquote>\n\nParochial Catholic norms somehow persist in a galactic empire. He has a slightly bizarre faith in the power of books to move entire populations. His names for things are often childish (buggers and piggies). He continues to make his young characters absurdly precocious (consider the 12yo Olhado, leet hacker).\n\nBut no matter: he is a master storyteller. He manages to use one village and one forest as if they were giant panoramas. If you found <i>Ender's Game</i> didactic, unrealistic, contrived - well, you're right, but give him another chance.\n\nHe's also slightly alien to me, which makes him good at scifi. Underneath Card's extreme Great Man Theory (where 3 people determine half of human history) there's a pretty realist account of how social forces work.\n<blockquote><i>Some sort of rigid hierarchy always emerged as the conservative force in a community, maintaining its identity despite the constant variations and changes that beset it. If there were no powerful advocate of orthodoxy, the community would inevitably disintegrate. A powerful orthodoxy is annoying, but essential to the community... She compared the priestly class to the skeleton of vertebrates.</i></blockquote>\nThis means that he has to eventually drop his mockery of the narrow and pompous bishop, who is exactly this skeletal force: dumb, reactionary, regularising. Card really likes communitarian shit: constraints, norms, rituals, and roles.\n<blockquote><i>And yet she felt strangely healed, as if simply saying her mistake were enough to purge some of the pain of it. For the first time, then, she caught a glimpse of what the power of speaking might be. It wasn’t a matter of confession, penance, and absolution, like the priests offered. It was something else entirely. Telling the story of who she was, and then realizing that she was no longer the same person.</i></blockquote>\n\nI wonder about the Descolada, the horrifying mutagenic disease that perfuses the planet. Ender accepts it without hesitation, even knowing that he'll never be able to leave. This echoes Card's fetish for family: \"constraints are <i>good</i>\". \n<spoiler>The entire plot turns on one insane decision of Novinha. \"<i>she would have no other death on her conscience</i>\". The desire for clean hands as sick iron law, more important than the desire for a good world. Ender's guilt is much the same. Card views the sickness as honourable, but also a sin, \"the pride of universal guilt\".</spoiler>\n\n<spoiler>Everyone is very blasé about letting Miro leave town while infected with a universal ecocidal disease. Yes, he ends up not contacting any ecosystems, but this is a late development.</spoiler>",

    "review": "Wonderful. Rivals <i>Earthsea</i> as the wisest and subtlest Fantasy, for people who don't like Fantasy. Fast-moving, full of ironies, antimonies, and ambivalent symbolism - the kind which doesn't hit you over the head (I'm thinking of Gandalf changing colour hmmmmmm). \r\n\r\nThere's a dozen memorable characters in 300pp (<a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Gurlo%25C3%25ABs&prev=search\">Gurloes</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thecla\">Thecla</a>, Agilus, Agia, Talos, Ultan, <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inire\">Inire</a>, Eata, Baldanders, the man himself), even though many appear for just one scene. And there's a very unobtrusive frame narrative which deepens and undermines things. \r\n\r\nAnd under all that: the beautiful post-post-apocalyptic layer: <i>New Sun</i> is actually science fiction, about what happens when the great project, Progress, collapses; what happens after thousands of years of decay. \r\n<i><blockquote> those who dig for their livelihood say there is no land anywhere in which they can trench without turning up shards of the past. No matter where the spade turns the soil, it uncovers broken pavements and corroded metal; and scholars write that the kind of sand that artists call polychrome (because flecks of every colour are mixed with its whiteness) is actually not sand at all, but the glass of the past, now pounded by aeons of tumbling in the clamorous sea.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt is <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw\">Clarkean</a>: The book is unconcerned whether strange events are due to obscure high technology, psychological trickery, or bonafide supernatural force.\r\n\r\nBecause Wolfe is a bit difficult, it's not too incongruous to bring up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanarrative\">Grand Narrative</a> now: sure, the French theorists were wrong to suggest that such ideas are dead in our time (or bad, if alive) but they certainly could die, and Wolfe explores what that'd be like. Nessus has no master idea - not even god, not even family, not even order. (Or maybe it's class again.)\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Severian. Name for me the seven principles of governance.\"\r\n     A foreboding grew on me; I sensed that if I did not reply, some tragedy would occur. At last I began weakly, \"Anarchy . . .\"\r\n     \"That is not governance, but the lack of it. I taught you that it precedes all governance. Now list the seven sorts.\"\r\n     \"Attachment to the person of the monarch. Attachment to the bloodline or other sequence of succession. Attachment to the royal state. Attachment to a code legitimizing the governing state. Attachment to the law only. Attachment to a greater or lesser board of electors, as framers of the law. Attachment to an abstraction conceived as including the body of electors, other bodies giving rise to them and numerous other elements, largely ideal.\"\r\n     \"Tolerable. Of these, which is the earlier form, and which the highest?\"\r\n     \"The development is in the order given, Master,\" I said. \"But I do not rrecall that you ever asked us before which was highest.\"\r\n     Master Malrubius leaned forward, his eyes burning brighter than the coals of the fire. \"Which is the highest, Severian?\"\r\n     \"The last, Master?\"\r\n     \"You mean attachment to an abstraction conceived as including the body of electors, other bodies giving rise to them, and numerous other elements, largely ideal?\"\r\n     \"Yes, Master.\"\r\n     \"Of what kind, Severian, is your own attachment to the Divine Entity?\"\r\n     I said nothing. It may have been that I was thinking; but if so, my mind was too much filled with sleep to be conscious of its thought. Instead, I became profoundly aware of my physical surroundings. The sky above my face in all its grandeur seemed to have been made solely for my benefit, and to be presented for my inspection now. I lay upon the ground as upon a woman, and the very air that surrounded me seemed a thing as admirable as crystal and as fluid as wine.\r\n     \"Answer me, Severian.\"\r\n     \"The first, if I have any.\"\r\n     \"To the person of the monarch?\"\r\n     \"Yes, because there is no succession.\" \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n(<i>Dune</i> occupies the same SFF feudalist netherland as this, but is much clumsier, occasionally contemptible.) \r\n\r\n    How do you write a truly immoral sympathetic character? (In this case, the most immoral: who does the worst thing you can do.) I think the answer is simple: <i>detail</i>. Make it first-person and simply show the ordinary range of interests, foibles, enculturation, passions. The reader does the rest.  (Compare <i>Lolita</i>, <i>Private Memoirs of a Justified Sinner</i>, <i>Wasp Factory</i>, <i>Crime and Punishment</i>...)\r\n<blockquote><i>Gurloes was one of the most complex men I have known, because he was a complex man trying to be simple. Not a simple, but a complex man's idea of simplicity. Just as a courtier forms himself into something brilliant and involved, midway between a dancing master and a diplomacist, with a touch of assassin if needed, so Master Gurloes had shaped himself to be the dull creature a pursuivant or bailiff expected to see when he summoned the head of our guild, and that is the only thing a real torturer cannot be. The strain showed; though every part of Gurloes was as it should have been, none of the parts fit... He ate too much and too seldom, read when he thought no one knew of it, and visited certain of our clients, including one on the third level, to talk of things none of us eaves-dropping in the corridor outside could understand. His eyes were refulgent, brighter than any woman's. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nSeverian is completely cold-blooded about violence while still being notably heroic and sentimental. <spoiler>(Ok he doesn't actually torture anyone.)</spoiler>\r\n<blockquote><i>By the use of the language of sorrow I had for the time being obliterated my sorrow - so powerful is the charm of words, which for us reduces to manageable entities all the passions that would otherwise madden and destroy...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe heroism is natural and plausible, because he dooms himself in the middle of the book, so everything that happens is a bonus to him, so he takes bandits and duels and unlikely undertakings in his stride, which is an enviable attitude.\r\n\r\nOne of many lovely details: all the Latin is subtly wrong: '<i>terminus est</i>' taken to be 'this is the line of division' rather than 'this is the end'; '<i>felicibus brevis, miseris hora longa</i>', 'Men wait long for happiness'. But most of the rest of the jargon is historically accurate: 'hydrargyrum' for mercury, 'hipparch' for <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cavalier#Etymology\">cavalier</a>, 'archon' for lord, 'carnifex' for butcher, 'matross' for junior soldier, etc.\r\n\r\n    The second half, the quest with Agia and Dorcas, reminds me of '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Sunrise\">Before Sunrise</a>', of all things: glittering words exchanged by the young and instantly intimate. The writing is so fine and uncliched that it pulls off unreconstructed romance in the midst of post-apocalyptic feudalism. In general, the feudal trappings justify Wolfe's ornate prose well. Severian often says things that are wise to us, and the things which aren't make sense in brutal context:\r\n<blockquote><i>the pattern of our guild is repeated mindlessly (like the repetitions of Father Inire's mirrors in the House Absolute) in the societies of every trade, so that they are all of them torturers, just as we. His quarry stands to the hunter as our clients to us; those who buy to the tradesman; the enemies of the Commonwealth to the soldier; the governed to the governors; men to women. All love that which they destroy.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nNietzsche on the wheel:\r\n<blockquote><i>Weak people believe what is forced on them. Strong people what they wish to believe, forcing that to be real. What is the Autarch but a man who believes himself Autarch and makes others believe by the strength of it.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nProbably 5/5 on re-read.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nPS: I can't decide if this or <a href=\"https://www.lwcurrey.com/pictures/158538.jpg?v=1519766806\">Fall of Hyperion</a> has the lower quality-of-book : awfulness-of-cover ratio.",

    "review": "Short critical portrait of a grand hypocrite. \r\n<blockquote><i>where Locke had spoken of \"life, liberty, and property\" as natural rights, Jefferson famously wrote \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\"... given the advantageous social position occupied by the delegates at Philadelphia, it is very striking indeed that [this] should have taken precedence over property.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nI was worried that Hitchens might have gone soft over his adopted land but it's full of this kind of thing:\r\n<blockquote><i>A bad conscience, evidenced by slovenly and contradictory argument, is apparent in almost every paragraph of his discourse on [slavery].\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nas well as his humourlessness, adultery, self-service, self-pity, horrendous partisanship, and, surprisingly, bloody ruthlessness. Jefferson:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nwhat signify a few lives lost in a century or two? the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants. it is it's natural manure.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n(He was pro-Jacobin for a terribly long time.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTry and judge him fairly. How did his actions (not his words lol) compare to the prevailing spirit?:\r\n\r\n* <i>Democracy</i>: Well above average, even revolutionary US average.\r\n* <i>Slaves</i>: Hard to say. Inherited 200. Freed only 7. Tried to write a condemnation of slavery into the Declaration. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Ordinance_of_1784\">Wrote a bill</a> banning slavery in new states, narrowly lost the vote. <i>\"Even as he yearned to get rid of them, he refused to let them go</i>\"\r\n* <i>Native Americans</i>: Average, bad.\r\n* <i>Freedom of speech</i>: Average. Had paid shills in the gutter press throughout his career, and prosecuted enemy journalists for Sedition.\r\n* <i>Freedom of religion</i>: Well above average.\r\n* <i>Women</i>: Average, bad. \r\n* <i>Working-class</i>: Above average in intention, protecting the \"<i>plundered ploughman and beggared yeomanry</i>\". Pretty populist, constantly ranting about bankers and tipping the political balance away from cities.\r\n\r\nJefferson: <blockquote><i>The man must be a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such circumstances.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nHis fear of a freedmen uprising apparently paralysed him. The conventional wisdom around 1800 was that you couldn't just free the slaves, you'd also have to deport them (to e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone#Colonial_era_(1800%E2%80%931960)\">Sierra Leone</a> like the British) to prevent them taking their rightful vengeance on the planters.  His turning on the Haitians for similar reasons is one of the saddest and dumbest moments in a life of compromise.\r\n\r\n---\r\n<blockquote><i>Whatever view one takes of Burke's deepening pessimism and dogmatic adherence to the virtues of Church and King, the fact is that after the summer of 1791 the Jacobins did their best to prove him right.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n\r\nDeleted scene from the Declaration of Independence:\r\n<blockquote><i>[King George] has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither.  This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the Christian King of Great Britain.  Determined to keep open a market where Men should be bought & sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or restrain this execrable commerce.  \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nAnd Hitchen's final exceptionalist thought:\r\n<blockquote><i>The French Revolution destroyed itself in Jefferson's own lifetime. More modern revolutions have destroyed themselves and others. If the American Revolution, with its... gradual enfranchisement of those excluded or worse at its founding, has often betrayed itself at home and abroad, it nevertheless remains the only revolution that still retains any power to inspire.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>",

    "review": "Scalding and fantastical send-up of novelists and readers. About a nasty little man made insane by being low status - or, rather, by his friend becoming high status. He's completely destroyed by valuing position so much, by his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality\">crab</a> mind:\r\n<blockquote><i>Richard, who would not mind being poor if no one was rich, who would not mind looking rough if no one looked smooth, who would not mind being old if no one was young.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThis is all the worse because he has taste and good ideas, between his maudlin self-pity and terrible ideas:\r\n<blockquote><i>    It would be a book accounting for the decline of the status and virtue of literary protagonists. First gods, then demigods, then kings, then great warriors, great lovers,then burghers and merchants and vicars and doctors and lawyers. Then social realism: you. Then irony: me. Then maniacs and murderers, tramps, mobs, rabble, flotsam, vermin.\r\n\r\nLiterature describes a descent... Literature, for a while, can be about us... about writers. But that won't last long. How do we burst clear of all this? \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nRichard's complete, painful self-absorption shows that literary envy, male rivalry, and the fear of death are similar if not the same: childish rage when you can't get what you want.\r\n\r\nAmis keeps interrupting Richard (himself) to talk about outer space, the fate of stars, the rounding error that we are: Amis undercuts pathetic irony with ultimate meaning, which is the reverse of the usual trick. I think this author insertion is why people call it 'postmodern', though of course <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-insertion\">it's an ancient trick</a> and Amis doesn't share their mean ideology. There's also self-reference:\r\n<blockquote><i>What </i>was<i> Richard? He was a revenger, in what was probably intended to be a comedy.</i></blockquote>\r\nOr maybe it's because Richard is a bland modernist (which here means: no fun) and Amis is taken not to be. Richard has violent thoughts and a violent worldview but is not violent, he fails to be violent; and Amis contains that container.\r\n\r\nThere are unannounced focal shifts every couple pages, three of which focalisations sound very similar to each other (whether psycho Steve, revenger Richard, misanthrope Martin).\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    This, surely, is how we account for the darkness and the helpless melancholy of twentieth-century literature. These writers, these dreamers and seekers, stood huddled like shivering foundlings on the cliffs of a strange new world: one with no servants in it. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nIt's not just about books; the underworld of 90s Britain also gets it:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    the criminal resembles the artist in his pretensions, his incompetence, and his self-pity.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nYou have to go a very long way - through tell of murdered children, celebrated suicides, denied misogyny, embraced misandry, deep duplicity - to get the merest possibility of redemption and getting over yourself. (And even that subverted: <i>The season of comedy... Decorum will be observed</i>.) The middle drags terribly. It's worth it.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* The titular Information is hard truths, avoided thoughts, intimations of inadequacy and mortality.\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nThe information is advertising a symposium of pain. Pains of all faiths and all denominations... It is ordinary and everyday. On the beach the waves do it ceaselessly, gathering mass and body, climbing until they break and are then resummoned into generality with a sound like breath sucked in between the teeth.\r\n\r\nWeakness will get you where you are weakest. Weakness will be strong and bold, and make for your weak spot. If in the head, then in the head. If in the heart, then in the heart. If in the loins, then in the loins... The information is nothing. Nothing: the answer is so many of our questions. What will happen to me when I die? What is death anyway? Is there anything I can do about that? Of what does the universe primarily consist? What is the measure of our influence within it? What is our span, in cosmic time?\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* Richard's friend is called Gwyn (Welsh for blessed).\r\n*  His book 'Untitled' is so serious that it causes its readers physical harm, like a petty version of the samizdat in <i>Infinite Jest</i>.\r\n* Amis is more like Gwyn than Richard in career terms (got an unprecedented £500k advance for this) but is obviously temperamentally more like Richard.\r\n* The more literary a work, the less it says plainly: the fewer hints you get. That is, *puzzles* are part of the essence of literariness. The bad reading of this is that it's all about showing off: how clever and sphinxish the author is, how clever and oedipal the reader, how able to delay gratification (or go without it) each is. Amis' books are quite puzzley, Richard's very much so, Gwyn's not a jot.\r\n* This line works as a diss on New Labour:\r\n<blockquote><i>It often seemed to him, moving in the circles he moved in and reading what he read, that everyone in England was Labour except the government.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\neven though the book was written in 1994, before New Labour. A joke which survives inversion!\r\n* <a href=\"https://www.astrotheme.com/astrology/Martin_Amis\">Presented without comment</a>.",

The result determined whether your life was an abusive wreck, or hey pretty ok. \r\n\r\n(At the time, to get a divorce you needed 1) to put up with it for three years, 2) to then blow the annual salary of 5 people (£200 then, ~£100,000 in today's money) bringing a fucking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrimonial_Causes_Act_1857#Background\">private Act of Parliament</a>; 3) to publicly and credibly state your husband's \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_England_and_Wales#History\">incest, sodomy, bigamy, or desertion</a>\" (not his adultery) and maybe also deal with MPs leering at your sex life. \r\n\r\nOh, and no remarriage ever, i.e. no socially acceptable relationships ever again.)\r\n\r\nAll this makes the book <i>about</i> something important, rather than important (or readable) itself. And Austen hardly covers this grimdark aspect. But I will probably have to read it again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* You might say that the primary-relationship-hunt is still the most important decision in modern people's lives. I think that's right for some people, but it's still less important than it was: now it's not the <i>only</i> decision in your life, and now you get to try again if you are unlucky or unwise.",

    "review": "Žižek may be the most high-variance writer since Nietzsche. <i>Very occasionally</i> he writes <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FSXBZMO3bgwJ:inthesetimes.com/article/1588/the_desert_of_the_real+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk\">beautiful, thoughtful pieces</a> and I am shocked and bewildered to find myself agreeing. The rest of the time he writes 1) edgy shit about how liberals are the real enemy and 2) complete nonsense about already dubious writers, leaking film theory and psychoanalysis into journalism, like raw sewage pouring into a ditch. There is some value in mere provocation. It is easily eclipsed.\n\nThis one includes a sadly memorable passage likening an intentional plane crash to a dildo with a camera on the end.",

(This is covered better in Chang's <i>Kicking Away the Ladder</i>, with its extensive details of postwar South Korea's shocking illiberalism: for instance, importing hi-tech goods was a serious crime for decades.)

    "review": "Initially, this looked like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplift_(science_fiction)\">Brin</a> rip-off, or a <a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2011/01/11/so-high-so-low-so-many-things-to-know-vernor-vinges-a-deepness-in-the-sky/\">Vinge</a> rip-off, or even a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(Discworld)#Structure_and_technology\">Pratchett</a> rip-off. And the prose is just serviceable. Title sucks too. \r\n\r\nBut it blooms: the long evolutionary pathway it follows - from a spider jeeust 'thinking' that pack hunting might be a good idea, to a full manned space program - is excellent. The alternative technological route is the great bit - what would industry look like without fossil fuel, a mechanised society without metal? - and the protagonist spiders who find the route are easy to empathise with. \r\n\r\nAnts are used as robots, factories, laboratories, and eventually as CPUs:\r\n<blockquote><i>There are hundreds of tamed ant colonies within Great Nest, not counting those in the surrounds that undertake the day-to-day business of producing food, clearing ground or fending off incursions of wild species. Each colony has been carefully trained, by subtle manipulation of punishment, reward and chemical stimulus, to perform a specific service, giving the great minds access to a curious kind of difference engine.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n{over-literal bull-shit}\r\n(Tchaikovsky overstates massively the potential of ants as a processing channel, though - witness the giant leap in practicality from ~1cm mechanical relays to (even the crappiest) fully-electronic vacuum-tube. Nothing so slow and large as an ant colony could carry out much logic-gate work without taking much longer than a human-level worker and anyway accumulating huge errors.)\r\n\\{/over-literal bull-shit}\r\n\r\n (Their bioengineering stuff is actually more realistic than Vinge's spiders' breakneck 50-year sprint through the C20th and C21st centuries, even if you include the Uplifting virus. This is because Vinge's telling is deterministic - they discover all the same stuff as us, in mostly the same order - and their culture a cartoon of ours.) \r\n\r\nHis other successful theme is incomprehension: females not understanding male liberation, spiders not understanding how a depressed solitary human could be sentient, Kern not understanding anything. (Mostly the spider gender politics are boring, just <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersecutionFlip\">bizarro patriarchy</a> with a cannibal twist.)\r\n\r\nThe main antagonist, the mad hubristic scientist starts off dull and strawish (why did it take 300 years for her to ask what rough genus the spiders were?) but the moment she stops that stuff and reaches across the species barrier is quite beautiful.\r\n\r\nAlso, Tchaikovsky often drops out of the Spiders' worldview mid-sentence to telegraph what you, a human, should be thinking of all this (an example is the use of \"curious\" in the passage above). \r\n\r\nThe humans are less interesting, fairly stock generation-shippers. There is this inversion, that the scholar of dead languages is Key Crew, plot-critical all the time:\r\n<blockquote><i>To study and laud those antique psychopaths during the Earth's last toxic days had seemed bad taste. Nobody liked a classicist.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nAnyway worthwhile, momentarily dazzling.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHow does it do as Serious science fiction?\r\n\r\n<i>Social development</i>: Lots. The spiders' matriarchal anarchism is shown with realistic downsides. The ark ship humans go through several revolutions and regressions.\r\n\r\n<i>Software development</i>: Some, but all pretty high-level. Thousands of years of uptime for some systems, with only hints at how to keep it going. Some nice linguistic archaeology.\r\n\r\n<i>Actual Science</i>: Mostly evo bio, little bit of computer science and crypto maybe.",

    "review": "Half the characters in this are ghosts, and one of the less-noted things about ghost stories is that they are wildly optimistic: they tend to show justice prevailing. Yes, fine, the ghost's revenge is a gory, creepy, retributive justice, and a bit late, but it's still the victim's triumph.\r\n\r\n    The sumtym narayter Bascule makes or breaks the book. He's a good character - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Molesworth\">Molesworth</a> on the Web - but I couldn't stand his phonetically told sections when I read this as a teen, and you'll see the reviews below focus on him despite him being only about a quarter of the focalisation. Bad spelling (cognitive dysfunction) is rare in sci-fi - let alone in SF titles - because the authors are trying to be taken seriously to make up for the genre fiction status? - and I've gotten over it since. Maybe better as audiobook. \r\n\r\n    The characters are squatting their own civ. What lives on (after a relatively gentle apocalypse) is more self-conscious, historically conscious than that in <i>Book of the New Sun</i>. Not ruined, just forgotten, off the <a href=\"https://www.nellwatson.com/blog/technological-wavefront\">wavefront</a>, using the space elevator as a house. The cyberspace is pretty good (better than <Hyperion</i> or <i>Snow Crash</i> or <i>Neuromancer</i> because less neat). \r\n<blockquote><i>The mist was the world was the data corpus was the Crypto-sphere was the history of the world was the future of the world was the guardian of un-done things was the summation of intel­ligent purpose was chaos was pure thought was the untouched was the utterly corrupted was the end and the beginning was the exiled and the resiled, was the creature and the machine was the life and the inanimate was the evil and the good was the hate and the love was the compassion and the indifference was everything and nothing and nothing and nothing.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nOne virtuoso passage, on the species' trajectory after a nebula occludes the sun:\r\n<blockquote><i>so humanity left the surface of the world to the ice, wind and snow, and sheltered, reduced and impoverished, within the stony depths of the planet's skin,  finally coming to resemble nothing more than parasites in the cooling pelt of some huge dying animal.\r\n\r\nWith it it took all its knowledge of the universe and all the memories of its achievements and all the coded information defining the animals and plants that had survived the vicissitudes of time and evolution and - especially - the pressure of the human species' own until then remorseless rise.\r\n\r\nThose buried citadels became whole small worlds of refugee communities and spawned still smaller worlds as new machines took over the job of maintaining the levels of the crypt, until gradually more and more of what was in any sense humanity came to reside not simply in the created world of its tunnels, caverns and shafts but within those worlds in the generated realities produced by its computers...\r\n\r\nStill, what was left of humanity persisted, retreating further from the open oven of the surface until it became trapped between it and the heat of the planet's own molten sub-surface.  It was then that the species finally gave up the struggle to remain in macrohuman form, pulling back fully into a virtual environment and resorted to storing its ancient biochemical inheritance as information only, in the hope that one day such fragile concoctions of water and minerals could exist again upon the face of the Earth.\r\n\r\nIts time from then was long as people reckoned it from that point, short as they would have before.  The sun's photosphere continued to expand until it swallowed Venus, and Earth did not survive much longer; the last humans on Earth perished together in a crumbling machine core as its cooling circuits failed, the half-finished life-boat spaceship they had been attempting to construct already melted to a hollow husk beside them.\r\n\r\nHe suffered with each child abandoned to the snow; with every old man or woman left - too exhausted to shiver any more - under piles of ice-hard rags; with all the people swept away by the howling, fire-storm winds; with each consciousness extinguished - its ordered information reduced to random meaninglessness - by the increasing heat.\r\n\r\nAnd he woke from such dreams sometimes wondering whether all that he was being shown could possibly be true, and on other occasions so convinced that it had been real that he would have faithfully believed what he had seen was the inescapable future, rather than some mere possibility, projection or warning.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nProblems: \r\n* Climaxes about 2/3 through. I suppose that's okay, it's not a three-act play.\r\n* Bascule is hooked into the king's brain surveillance network, but regularly escapes the king's secret police.\r\n* Banks shows the crypt people having <a href=\"http://ageofem.com/\">Em</a> accelerated cognition (about 1000x), but without Ems dominating the economy and society. (Actually, no human besides the military, scientists and secret police are heard of doing any real work, so maybe this is the case in the background.) \r\n* It's set on Earth, which is odd for Banks, but this fact isn't used much. Some of us stayed behind.\r\n* There are several virtual worlds in this (the bird crypt, the transport map, the interrogation allegories, the deep crypt with its garden) but they're insufficiently different from each other and base reality (all have a kind of fairytale logic, all have mythical beasts stalking around).\r\n* None of the sheer stakes, grandeur, and philosophical tension of the Culture books.\r\n* Fun but a mere sketch.",

    "review": "Pretty annoying fanfiction. Yalom crowbars Breuer (proto-Freud, the Anna O. guy) into Nietzsche's life, because it would've stretched taste to have Young Freud (pre-Charcot) do it. His is a strange one-dimensional Nietzsche, with none of the real one's lightness, humour, and contempt. (I imagine the portrayal of Breuer is equally simplistic and annoying, but I'm not interested in finding out.)\n\nMuch like <i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2482793876?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1\">In the Light of What We Know</a></i>: an oracle and a servant discoursing like desperate teenagers, for hundreds of pages.\n\nAs usual with psychoanalysts, Yalom gives little time to the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/3313279/Madness-of-Nietzsche-was-cancer-not-syphilis.html\">organic causes</a> of Nietzsche's mental disorders. He was very ill for most of his life; he wasn't a macho prick in the usual sense, since he poured himself out in letters. Yalom doesn't succeed in porting this outpour.",

    "review": "Lovely. She pitches it at anxious people - and just mentioning the difficulty, just treating a block as a normal problem with normal solutions, dissolves half the problem. The chapters are tiny and repetitive and cutesy, no doubt also intended.\r\n\r\nThe other side of being humanistic is that she draws on theories from the dodgiest sciences: social psychology, pedagogy and a bit of pop neuroscience. But unlike similar books by Baumeister and Dweck, the dubious results are like rhetorical ornament rather than the crux. I give it a pass. Also she's a good teacher, so gets plenty of feedback from students about what actually works. \r\n\r\nShe accounts for human variance, obviously vital for any good advice:\r\n<blockquote><i>Take a step back and look dispassionately at your strengths and weaknesses. If you need more time to learn [a given amount of] math and science, that’s simply the reality. If you’re in high school, try to arrange your schedule to give yourself the time you need to focus on the more difficult materials, and limit these materials to manageable proportions. If you’re in college, try to avoid a full load of heavy courses, especially if you are working on the side. A lighter load of math and science courses can, for many, be the equivalent of a heavy load of other types of courses. Especially in the early stages of college, avoid the temptation to keep up with your peers... learning slowly can mean you learn more deeply than your fast-thinking classmates.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nMaybe won't do much for you if you've ever had a good maths teacher.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<b>Claims</b>\r\n\r\n- Two disjoint brain modes: focused (\"studying\") and diffuse (\"shower thoughts\"). Mixture of the two is needed for problem solving: focus, then unfocus. Sleep is [diffuse](https://www.bytestart.co.uk/relaxing-edisons-technique-solve-problems).<br>\r\n- Einstellung effect: anchoring on the first flawed approach. Focus as the opposite of exploring.<br>\r\n- You need lots of time: time to switch modes, time to chunk content into strong abstractions, time to form long-term memory.<br>\r\n- Spaced repetition duh<br>\r\n- \"Chunk creation\" (learning suitable abstractions): focus on it, get the gist, practice (how to use it), work out applicable contexts (when to use it), test recall<br>\r\n- Worked examples are good<br>\r\n- But seeing the answer leads to the illusion of competence (hindsight bias). <br>\r\n- Re-reading the formula also leads to illusion of recall (\"it's in my head\")<br>\r\n- Go walk and chew it over<br>\r\n- Some overlearning (\"continuing the study or practice after it is well understood\"), not too much<br>\r\n- \"If you don’t understand a method, stop and work backward. Go to the Internet and discover who first figured out the method or some of the earliest people to use it. Try to understand how the creative inventor arrived at the idea and why the idea is used\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<b>Misc</b>\r\n\r\n* Not sure about the examples here: \r\n<blockquote><i>the brain is designed to do extraordinary mental calculations. We do them every time we catch a ball, or rock our body to the beat of a song, or maneuver our car around a pothole in the road. We often do complex calculations, solving complex equations unconsciously, unaware that we sometimes already know the solution as we slowly work toward it</i></blockquote>\r\nThis is a classic modelling mistake of physicists. I think motor coordination is done by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze_heuristic\">simple rule of thumb</a> plus a control loop (see motion, move hand, predict path, see motion, move hand) rather than unconscious calculus or ODEs.\r\n\r\n* One place she overdoes the weak psych is insisting that the world is just when it comes to mental power. \r\n<blockquote><i>A superb working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts can’t easily peek through. Such tightly controlled attention could use an occasional whiff of ADHD-like fresh air—the ability, in other words, to have your attention shift even if you don’t want it to shift. Your ability to solve complex problems may make you overthink simple problems... their slower way of thinking can allow them to see confusing subtleties that others aren’t aware of. </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n* Happy to see the late Seth Roberts show up. He went too far and dogmatic, but his impulse towards self-experiments is great. \r\n<blockquote><i>first self-experiment involved his acne. A dermatologist had prescribed tetracycline, so Roberts simply counted the number of pimples he had on his face with varying doses of tetracycline. The result? The tetracycline made no difference on the number of pimples he had! Roberts had stumbled across a finding that would take medicine another decade to discover—that seemingly powerful tetracycline, which has unsafe side effects, doesn’t necessarily work on acne...</i></blockquote>",

I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible, to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 10^9 [bits], to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning. The original question, \"Can machines think?\" I believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion. \r\n\r\nNevertheless I believe that at the end of the century the use of words, and general educated opinion, will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted. I believe further that no useful purpose is served by concealing these beliefs. The popular view that scientists proceed inexorably from well-established fact to well-established fact, never being influenced by any improved conjecture, is quite mistaken. Provided it is made clear \r\nwhich are proved facts and which are conjectures, no harm can result.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nWe failed him on this specific timeframe, but it won't be too long (2030?).",

    "review": "Has many of St Aubyn's distinctive virtues - acute black comedy about every social stratum, characters creatively misspending resources, the sometime delight of being exploited, actual knowledge of modern philosophy - but this time it doesn't gel.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist, Fairburn, writes a book with Patrick Melrose as a character - which invites us to identify Fairburn with St Aubyn. But it doesn't fit very well; Fairburn's life work is meaningless and saccharine. They are both troubled and self-destructive and possibly redeemed I suppose. \r\n\r\nThe enframed narrative with Patrick is annoying, and annoyingly this is intentional:\r\n<blockquote><i>Yesterday Angelique came into the bedroom holding my thin manuscript. She moved towards the open window and I surged up from the pillows shouting, ‘Don’t!’\r\n‘Oh, don’t worry,’ she said, ‘I’m not going to throw it out of the window — that would be doing you a favour.’\r\n‘You don’t like it?’\r\n‘It’s wooden and dry and boring. I can’t believe this is what you want to do with your last days. Why don’t you write about how wonderful the figs taste when you know you may never taste one again?’\r\n‘Because they don’t,’ I said, ‘they taste like ash.’\r\n‘Why don’t you tell us how we must live every moment to the full because life is so precious?’\r\n‘Because if it’s dying that makes you realize that, you’re already too anxious to do anything about it. I wanted to do something serious…’\r\n‘You are doing something serious: you’re dying,’ she said, laughing.\r\n‘Something impersonal.’\r\n‘But that’s exactly the problem: you must make it more personal, more human, more dramatic. You should write from your own experience, write about us... I think the real problem is that you don’t know how to make abstract ideas exciting...’\r\nShe left the room and, paralysed by failure and confusion, I watched the breeze scatter the pages across the floor.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThis is a good skewering of upper-middle-class / academic conceit:\r\n<blockquote><i>The warden’s sly, pedantic chuckle seemed to reverberate among the bookshops and gargoyles that guarded the taxi rank; his gurgling complacencies soaked the golden buildings until they split open like soggy trifle. Perhaps they had once been intended for something serious, but there had been too many puns, too many Latin tags, too many acrostics, too many fiendish crossword puzzles, too many witty misquotations and too many sly chuckles for them to do anything but rot, however noble and solid they might look to the winking eye of a tourist’s camera.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nMany, many different ideas about consciousness show up appear, from the zany (Penrose and Sheldrake) to the canonical (Colin McGinn and Galen Strawson). The stuff on Penrose and Sheldrake is accurate, in the weak sense that it describes their positions correctly. Sadly it's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_mysterianism\">mysterianism</a> that wins over Patrick / Charlie. The conclusion is roughly a celebration of the mere manifest image, quietism, Wittgenstein's gallic shrug. It manages to miss the point of scientific interest in consciousness, and underestimate the progress it's made already:\r\n<blockquote><i> I saw the latest cluster of books to emerge from the great consciousness debate: Emotional Intelligence, The Feeling Brain, The Heart’s Reasons. I felt the giddy relief of knowing that I wasn’t going to read any of them. The fact that science has decided to include emotion in its majestic worldview seems about as astute as an astronomer discovering the moon.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nOh well. Plenty of cynical goodness besides. For instance, I have felt the following emotion, back when I didn't have the spine to refuse to go clubbing:\r\n<blockquote><i>   I sat down on a velvet bench and through all the smoke and the bad music and the undesirable desire I suddenly allowed myself to become relaxed. Even here there was no need to posture. The essential question remained the same. Where could I find freedom in this situation? I looked around and felt reconciled with all the people in Alessandro's party and all the people in the room. I could spray adjectives at them for the rest of the evening, but in the end they were just people struggling to be happy with only the most unpromising material at their disposal.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n    ",

    "review": "I don't want to hector Homer. But somehow this was both boring and evil, both childish and didactic. I won't belabour the book's immorality, since it is so obvious; it's the near-total absence of artistic merit that is apparently not obvious. I found nothing in it worth reading or quoting until Book 9, nearly half way through. Songs of praise of warmongering pirates. (People love pirates, and I say let em. Just don't call them paragons.) \r\n\r\nThe ideology is dad porn, a set of thin, obvious, animal values. \"Kings do whatever they want - death for messing with a noble; don't cross the priests; offer huge sacrifices; always do what your husband and dad say; the unlucky and the disabled are cursed and to be shunned; blood is blood is blood.\" \r\n<blockquote><i>    The ghost\r\n    of Agamemnon answered, “Lucky you,\r\n    cunning Odysseus: you got yourself\r\n    a wife of virtue—great Penelope.\r\n    How principled she was, that she remembered\r\n    her husband all those years! Her fame will live\r\n    forever, and the deathless gods will make\r\n    a poem to delight all those on earth\r\n    about intelligent Penelope.\r\n</blockquote></i>(Odysseus sleeps with half a dozen other women and demigods, most of them begging him to, and needless to say suffers nothing of it.)\r\n\r\nThere's no mention of the suffering of the several cities he sacks, or the many tacitly raped women. Dozens of people are murdered for being rude, though. For a quasi-sacred text there's a surprising amount of unpunished priest killing (e.g. Leodes).\r\n\r\nThe structure is awful: we see almost nothing of Odysseus for the first quarter of the poem, instead following his son around as he listens to a series of boring old men. Most of Odysseus' feats are not shown, are instead related by him as unaffecting stories. (I suppose we could amuse ourselves by treating this as unreliable narration, but they certainly didn't.) And the poem doesn't end at its climax, instead meandering on through another few books of pointless back-patting.\r\n\r\n(Should I go easy? After all, this is groundbreaking work, the <i>prototype</i> of art. Sure; I'll go easy if you stop hyping it and making everyone read it as an exemplar.)\r\n(It's not that they could easily have been otherwise. Too poor, too lawless, too near to nature.)\r\n\r\nIt must be a cliche among classicists that the 'Classical' civilisations were not <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/classical\">classical</a> in the sense of being austere, logical, tasteful, or contemplative. That they were not Apollonian, that only a handful of people in them were. I hope my rant here is not just me being misled by the modern sense of \"hero\" - but the fact is that Odysseus wins, is praised endlessly, and his rights trump all else.\r\n\r\nThis isn't just me being clueless, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orality\">post-oral</a>, and close-minded: The ancients were well aware that the ending is unsatisfying crap. One popular headcanon was that, after Odysseus slays the suitors, he is immediately exiled from Ithaca, set adrift again. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPrd8FoClAA\">Cue the music!</a>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne reading of Odysseus' name is as variant of the verb '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus#Name,_etymology,_and_epithets\">to be hated</a>'. So a calque might be \"King Punchable of Ithaca\". (\"the most unhappy man alive\")\r\n\r\nOdysseus is treated incredibly well by almost everyone, despite his crimes. Complete strangers oil him up and dress him in fine \"woolen cloak and tunic\" <i>eleven times</i>, and he is given precious weaponry and potions for nothing several times. This is supposed to reflect on him, but instead it shows the Greek ideal of hospitality, one of the few nice things in that culture.\r\n\r\nHe appears to sincerely miss Ithaca (his status more than his wife), weeping frequently. But he also fucks about all the time, for instance staying an entire year voluntarily enjoying Circe.\r\n\r\nIt is completely unclear what O does to deserve his fortune. (Whereas his misfortune is always directly linked to his own machismo or idiocy.) The only virtues we see him exercise directly (not counting brute aggression and discus throwing) are courage and cunning (specifically lying). Ok, he also makes one good speech:\r\n<blockquote><i>'Listen to me, my friends, despite your grief.\r\nWe do not know where darkness lives, nor dawn,\r\nnor where the sun that shines upon the world\r\ngoes underneath the earth, nor where it rises.\r\nWe need a way to fix our current plight,\r\nbut I do not know how...</blockquote></i>\r\nI suppose we can put the rest down to charisma, the oddest and least rational of human powers.\r\n<blockquote><i>'It seems that everybody loves this man,\r\nand honors him, in every place we sail to.'</blockquote></i>\r\nEveryone extols him without him ever demonstrating the virtues they extol. (Politeness, propriety, wisdom, strategy...) Every other idiot is \"godlike\" at something or other, and seeing the state of their gods you see how this could be true. At least it's funny:\r\n<blockquote><i>He went out of his bedroom like a god</blockquote></i><blockquote><i>King Menelaus, you are right... Your voice is like a god's to us.</blockquote></i><blockquote><i>Majestic, holy King Alcinous\r\nleapt out of bed, as did Odysseus\r\nthe city-sacker. Then the blessed king,\r\nmighty Alcinous, led out his guest...</blockquote></i>\r\n(The gods are stupid mirrors of Greek nobility; for instance they have supernatural slaves, the nymphs.) This at least is a philosophical difference between them and I: in their superstitious idealist mode, properties aren't for describing the present, but instead the timeless essence of a thing:\r\n<blockquote><i>Ships are \"black\", \"hollow\", \"swift\" or \"curved\", never \"brown\", \"slow\" or \"wobbly\"... Penelope is \"prudent Penelope\", never \"swift-footed Penelope\", even if she is moving quickly. Telemachus is thoughtful, even when he seems particularly immature.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nAll the feats of the heroes are totally dependent on the power of gods. If they say you can't sail, you can't. <blockquote><i>His skin \r\nwould have been ripped away, and his bones smashed\r\nhad not Athena given him a thought.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>Athena poured unearthly charm\r\nupon his head and shoulders, and she made him\r\ntaller and sturdier, so these Phaecians\r\nwould welcome and respect him.</blockquote></i>\r\nWithout Hermes or Athena constantly intervening, O would be nowhere, achieve nothing. One nice tension here though:\r\n<blockquote><i>But death is universal. Even gods\r\ncannot protect the people that they love,\r\nwhen fate and cruel death catch up with them.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nOne of the few times I felt sympathy for Odysseus was when he was trying to lead his men, who are mainly large-adult-sons. (Same with the suitors.) One breaks his neck falling down a ladder. They undo a month of work by playing with the bag of winds. Several times they are totally paralysed by their wailing and tantrums. \r\n<blockquote><i>As when \r\na herd of cows is coming back from pasture\r\ninto the yard; and all the little heifers\r\njump from their pens to skip and run towards\r\ntheir mothers, and they cluster round them, mooing;\r\njust so my men, as soon they saw me, \r\nbegan to weep...</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>The other men... \r\nwept for those that died. I ordered them\r\nto stop their crying, scowling hard at each.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nOdysseus occasionally draws his sword on them for backtalking him, or running around like Muppets. Their deaths are roughly equally due to Odysseus' aggression and avarice, and their own foolishness.\r\n\r\nI cheered the uprising against him, who are completely in the right. But of course they lose, because of mere divine intervention.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOK I lied: I will talk about evil. Though by the end of this I was jaded and dismissive, the aftermath of Odysseus slaughtering the suitors still struck me as an atrocity unusual for the genre:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"When the whole house is set in proper order,\r\nrestore my halls to health: take out the [slave] girls\r\nbetween the courtyard wall and the rotunda.\r\nHack at them with long swords, eradicate\r\nall life from them. They will forget the things\r\n<b>the suitors made them do</b> with them in secret,\r\nthrough Aphrodite...\"\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to grant these girls\r\na clean death, since they poured down shame on me\r\nand Mother, when they lay beside the suitors.\"\r\n\r\nAt that, he would a piece of sailor's rope\r\nround the rotunda...\r\njust so the girls, their heads all in a row,\r\nwere strung up with the noose around their necks\r\nto make their death an agony. They gasped,\r\nfeet twitching for a while, but not for long.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nI've read de Sade, Kaczynski, Himmler, Houellebecq, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moral_Virologist\">Egan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm\">Watts</a> at their most dyspeptic; it's not that I'm squeamish about real or fictional evil, or that my sulking sense of justice blinds me to aesthetics. This sort of thing happened; nothing cannot be said; maybe even nothing cannot be said beautifully. It's just that, again, there is nearly no nobility and no classicism in this. I am so glad this culture is gone.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDid its audience know the story was bullshit? Or was it scripture to them? (Like most scripture, it is pathetically ignoble, violent, and self-serving.) Well, <a href=\"https://www.franksmitha.com/history/homer.htm\">they don't seem</a> to have had scripture, not even Hesiod. So Homer is more like Dante or Milton for them: not sacred, but pious and moralising.\r\n\r\nHow big was mighty Troy? How noble was godlike Odysseus? How petty their pantheon? How long this epic?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Even thought-provoking bits like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus-eaters\">lotus eaters</a> or Cyclopean anarchism are over in less than half a page.\r\n\r\n* Surprised when Zeus was described as \"husband of Hera\". \r\n\r\n* The \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outis#Origin_of_the_name\">no man</a>\" pun thing was so stupid I had to put the book down for a couple of days.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNormally I would stop reading a book this bad, but I read it to prepare for <i>Ulysses</i>, so I dragged myself through.\r\n\r\nWilson's introduction takes up a quarter of the entire book. It's good and sane but repetitive, taking pains to spell out all the ignoble and questionable, all the ugly and clumsy parts. I don't know how she keeps up her enthusiasm for the book, in the face of them, but more power to her.\r\n\r\nPlus two points for Wilson's intro and demystified translation.",

    "review": "I was trying to get a handle on all of pop music - pop, that is, in the broad sense that anything that couldn't get played in a fancy concert hall is pop, that anything newer than Gershwin is pop. I spent years on this endeavour, eventually reaching the <a href=\"https://www.scaruffi.com/music/groups.html\">Scaruffian</a> fringes: everything at least heard of, every landmark clung to by fingertips. I'm not sure why I did it. \r\n\r\nOr, I know but it isn't pretty: The people who know most about music are the ones who need it most: need it as a pretext to wear headphones and not talk to people, need it as vicarious catharsis for things felt but never said, need it as a gigantic arena for countercultural status, where if you only put in a thousand hours of skronk and dischord, then you're a thousand hours ahead of someone.\r\n\r\nReading <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/arts/music-an-instant-fan-s-inspired-notes-you-gotta-listen.html\">Lester Bangs</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPmCkmDIRlY\">Comedian Harmonists</a> (!), included here, remains one of the most powerful moments in my entire reading life.

    "review": "<blockquote><i>pinch yourself, and remember what you are. What do you see?\r\n\r\nI see bundles of proteins and lipids arranged in a giant colony of cells, lives given over to the implementation of a wet protein computer that thinks it's a person... Look at us, the first species among the animals that can figure out what the stars are, still tightly bound to impulse and social pressure. (Notice how silly it is, monkeys acting all serious and wise as they try to affect the course of history.)... [but still] see the lost monkey who's trying to steer an entire universe...</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nConsequentialism for humans. Important because it is rare for discussions of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demandingness_objection\">demandingness</a>\" or \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrupulosity\">scrupulosity</a>\" to speak about specific behavioural patterns or phenomenology.  (It also has the most important part of self-help, an awareness that positive advice is never universal: \"<i>remember the law of equal and opposite advice. For every piece of advice useful to one person, there is some other person who needs exactly the opposite advice.</i>\") \r\n\r\n(I put off reading this for a whole year, and felt bad about it. So.)\r\n\r\nHe'd have you move from external motivation to intrinsic motivation because it's more sustainable, and so more effective. He's quite radical about this, ditching normal moral psychology:\r\n<blockquote><i>the way that most people use the word \"should,\" most of the time, is harmful. People seem to use it to put themselves in direct and unnecessary conflict with themselves... imagine the person who wakes up feeling a bit sick. They say to themselves, \"ugh, I should go to the pharmacy and pick up medication before work.\" Now picking up meds feels like an obligation: if they don't get meds, then that's a little bit of evidence that they're incompetent, or akrasiatic, or bad... this disconnects the reason from the task, it abolishes the \"why\". The person feeling sick now feels like they have an obligation to pick up medication, and so if they do it, they do it grudgingly, resenting the situation... Now imagine they say this, instead: \"ugh, if I went to the pharmacy to pick up medication, I'd feel better at work today.\"</blockquote></i> \r\n<blockquote><i>Your true shoulds, if I could show them to you, would not look like a list of obligations. Your true shoulds would look like a recipe for building a utopia.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>Many treat their moral impulses as a burden. But I say, find all the parts that feel like a burden, and drop them. Keep only the things that fill you with resolve, the things you would risk life and limb to defend.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>I find it amusing that \"we need lies because we can't bear the truth\" is such a common refrain, given how much of my drive stems from my response to attempting to bear the truth.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Badness\" is not a fundamental property that a person can have. At best, \"they're bad\" can be shorthand for either \"I don't want their goals achieved\" or \"they are untrained in a number of skills which would be relevant to the present situation\"; but in all cases, \"they are bad\" must be either shorthand or nonsense.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nWouldn't Nietzsche in his better moods (or Laozi at any time) smile?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe strategy is roughly:\r\n\r\n1. Find something to care about. (Obstacles: hiding in bed, defensive relativism or nihilism, hiding in routine.)\r\n2. Drop all obligations and see what you still care about.\r\n3. Build intrinsic drive (change environment, train willpower and habit)\r\n4. Draw on the fact that the world is broken as fuel \r\n5. See guilt as an alien concept, unnecessary for the higher goals.\r\n\r\nAn important distinction:\r\n\r\n* <i>Listless guilt</i>: feeling bad because you feel you should do something with your life, but not really thinking about what.\r\n* <i>Specific guilt</i>: feeling bad because of unmet obligations to a particular goal.\r\n* <i>Akrasia guilt</i>: feeling bad because you're not following the endorsed plan.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne startling bit: some people report that following his advice has \"broken\" them, in the sense that guilt was indeed propping up their lives. His response is, \"good\":\r\n<blockquote><i>Some people, when they stop forcing themselves to do things because they \"should,\" will do a bit less to improve the world. They'll bow a bit less to social pressure, and insofar as the social pressure was pushing them to do what you think is good, you might count that as a loss. Some people don't care about things larger than themselves, and that's perfectly fine, and making them more resilient to social pressure might lose the world some charity.\r\n\r\nI expect that far more charity is lost from people convincing themselves that their altruistic desires are external obligations and resenting them. I expect that most people who feel obligated to improve the world and only do it because they \"should\" will become much more effective if they stop forcing themselves...\r\n\r\nYou can recover from breaking a few parts of yourself, so long as you're modular rather than fragile. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n(This attitude is <i>strongly</i> reminiscent of the person Scott Alexander is incredulous about at the end of <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/16/fear-and-loathing-at-effective-altruism-global-2017/\">this great, great piece</a>, though with instrumental harm.)\r\n\r\nI'd probably be more cautious, and advise you not to read this if you don't have lots of <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/\">slack</a>, support, and stomach for <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/see-the-dark-world/\">horrible facts</a>. (Soares finds intrinsic motivation in attending to how awful the world is, how much it needs fixing.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's short but dense with interesting ideas. (e.g. the nice concise <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/the-stamp-collector/\">rebuttal of naive internalist egoism.</a>)\r\n\r\nEach post repeats its point at least three times, which I suppose is intentional pedagogy, but it made me skim a lot. Soares also often links forward to posts you haven't read yet, confusingly.\r\n\r\nI'm not particularly guilt-ridden or scrupulous, on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/books/review-strangers-drowning-examines-extreme-do-gooders.html\">the scale of things</a>, but I still found this good. Not sure I buy everything in it, but the rough method (move from vague to specific guilt, and then view the specific guilt as an external and unhelpful force in the light of your specific goal) seems sensible.\r\n\r\nIf the following worldview or prose doesn't appeal to you, it's not for you:\r\n<blockquote><i> you will not be measured by the number of moments in which you worked as hard as you could. You will not be judged by someone rooting around in your mind to see whether you were good or bad. You will not be evaluated according to how unassailable your explanations are, for why things you couldn't possibly have prevented were the things that went wrong.\r\n\r\nYou will be measured only by what actually happens... this is the driver that takes the place of guilt... All we need to do, in any given moment, is look upon the actions available to us and take whichever one seems most likely to lead to a future full of light.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nWhy should we listen to self-help, unless the author has done something impressive? I don't know if you find <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uX3HjXo6BWos3Zgy5/the-mechanics-of-my-recent-productivity\">these</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3zDvoLoao\">things</a> impressive, but they serve.",

    "review": "Character study of twenty vengeful people and the awful, indispensable institution they serve and constitute. The detectives are intelligent and hilarious, but have to navigate two extreme and depressing environments: the streets and City Hall, violence and politics.\r\n\r\nSimon was embedded with them, and completely effaces himself, makes this novelistic. We get a glorious outsider view, see things the detectives don't: \r\n<blockquote><i>[The detective] glides past the lockup without looking inside, and so doesn't see the final, unmistakable expression on Robert Frazier's face. Pure murderous hate.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nHe gives a complete chapter to most of the detectives, tracking them through a couple of sordid weeks. They are all distinctive, sharp in different ways, but this approach means it stretches on.\r\n\r\nAlso a study of the incredibly poor incentives the bureaucracy gives the detectives: they're rewarded for arrests, not convictions, and individually penalised for open homicides. I don't want to think about what this did to their false arrest rate. \r\n<blockquote><i>A case in which the pathologist's finding is being pended is not, to the police department, a murder. And if it isn't a murder, it doesn't go up on the board. And if it isn't up on the board, it doesn't really exist.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nNo weight was given to the difficulty of the case - whether witnesses remained at the scene, whether physical evidence existed, whether the weapon was found. All this killed inter-squad cooperation, and led to infighting over dumb luck of the draw. \r\n<blockquote><i>In human terms, the scene at 3002 McElderry Street was a massacre; in the statistical terms of urban homicide work, it was the stuff from which a detective fashions dreams.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n(No other crime counted in the stats, despite Homicide also covering accidental deaths and suicides. This was an incentive to frame things as e.g. suicide if at all possible.) \r\n<blockquote><i>the chance of actually being convicted of a crime after being identified by authorities is about 60 percent. And if you factor in those unsolved homicides, the chance of being cuaght and convicted for taking a life in Baltimore is just over 40 percent [in 1988].\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nYou might conclude - falsely - that internal stats are worse than nothing - but only stats as bad as these are. A classic of informal institutional economics. \r\n\r\nThe nationwide murder 'clearance rate' (arrest rate) was 70%. Amazing that it was this high, in that comparatively low-surveillance, low-social-trust place.\r\n<blockquote><i>     The [squad's] clearance rate - murders closed by arrest - is now 36 percent and falling, a... threat to [Lieutenant] Gary D’Addario’s tenure. The board that gave His Eminence reason for concern six weeks ago has continued to fill with open murders, and it is on D’Addario’s side of the wall that the names are writ in red. Of the twenty-five homicides handled by Dee’s three squads, only five are down; whereas Stanton’s shift has cleared ten of sixteen...\r\n\r\nThere is no point in explaining that three fifths of D’Addario’s homicides happen to be drug-related, just as seven of those solved by Stanton’s shift are domestics or other arguments... It is the unrepentant worship of statistics that forms the true orthodoxy of any modern police department.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nMore incentive analysis, on police shootings and the shameful closing of ranks:\r\n<blockquote><i>In the United States, only a cop has the right to kill as an act of personal deliberation and action.  To that end, Scotty McCown and three thousand other men and women were sent out on the streets of Baltimore with .38-caliber Smith&Wessons, for which they received several weeks of academy firearms training augmented by one trip to the police firing range every year. Coupled with an individual officer’s judgement, that is deemed expertise enough to make the right decision every time.\r\n\r\nIt is a lie. It is a lie the police department tolerates because to do otherwise would shatter the myth of infallibility on which rests its authority for lethal force. And it is a lie that the public demands, because to do otherwise would expose a terrifying ambiguity. The false certainty, the myth of perfection, on which our culture feeds…\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n    There's so much careful and sympathetic detail about the job (and no deep portrait of any suspects), that Simon risks partisanship - writing \"copaganda\", as internet radicals call it. Anyone who's seen <i>The Wire</i> knows this isn't a problem. (He has solidarity with the rank and file, and contempt for the suits.) \r\n<blockquote><i>for the black, inner-city neighborhoods of Baltimore, the city's finest were for generations merely another plague to endure: poverty, ignorance, despair, police.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nSpeaking of which: This is not at all made redundant by <i>The Wire</i> - the show has an entire pathos-pathetic angle (the anti-authority cop) missing here, and this is more focussed on the law side.\r\n\r\nTheir humour is fantastically sick. \r\n<blockquote><i>the application of criteria such as comfort and amusement to the autopsy room is ample proof of a homicide man's peculiar and sustaining psychology. But for the detectives, the most appalling visions have always demanded the greatest detachment...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17521127&fbclid=IwAR1uFwE3NzWZMLp4v6VyJSuaXt9A5znB27peiHbndeg0k4ojVVVdHqUvEBg\">Someone on Hacker News</a> was up on their high horse about the black humour of medics recently. This strikes me as perfectly backwards. I would <i>much</i> prefer a doctor (or a detective) with a nasty sense of humour: it suggests emotional detachment, so they're more likely to think clearly; and it certainly has a cathartic and bonding role, improving their health and teamwork. This idiotically literal, first-order model of psychology (as if people were so easy to program!) is everywhere, for instance all discourse about fake news, porn, and violent computer games. \r\n\r\nThe section about the idiocy and arbitrariness of juries is sickening and I recommend that you don't read it if you want to continue thinking well of your society.\r\n<blockquote><i>The operant logic of a Baltimore city jury is as fantastical a process as any other of our universe’s mysteries. This one is innocent because he seemed so polite and well spoken on the stand, that one because there were no fingerprints on the weapon to corroborate the testimony of four witnesses. And this one over here is telling the truth when he says he was beaten into a confession; we know that, of course, because why else would anyone willingly confess to a crime if he wasn’t beaten?</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>The other eight jurors offered little opinion except to say they would vote for whatever was agreed upon... It was the Memorial Day weekend. They wanted to go home...\r\n\"What brought you all around to first-degree?\" he asks.\r\n\"I wasn't going to budge and that other woman, the one in the back row, she wasn't going to change her mind either. She was for first-degree from the very beginning, too. After a while, everyone wanted to go home, I guess.\"\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe book has aged badly in one way: Simon completely falls for two entrenched bits of pseudoscience, the <a href=\"https://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_lie_detector_test_revisited_a_great_example_of_junk_science\">polygraph</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph#Effectiveness\">and</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/12/18044688/criminal-profilers-mindhunter-hannibal-criminal-minds\r\n\">profiling</a>. But many people still believe in these things, and anyway it's a rare lapse of scepticism, for him.\r\n\r\nI think this is the first 'true crime' book I've read. Don't know if this is the pinnacle of the genre, then, or if the genre's better than literary people think.",

    "review": "What we hate about business books is their clichés, their fawning, their Panglossian grin, their being completely invalid because they don't consider <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias\">survivorship bias</a>, and their prose. This one avoids all these things and is radical in an unconventional way.*\r\n\r\nIt's hard to know what to think of Thiel. He's easy to demonise - much easier than his loudmouth peer Musk. For instance, he's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship\">anti-college</a>, anti-affirmative-action, anti-Clinton - and even openly anti-competition! (And <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/29604-parabiosis-peter-thiel-blood\">a vampire</a>!)\r\n\r\nBut I've been impressed with his clarity and sense of proportion <a href=\"https://www.weltwoche.ch/ausgaben/2018-29/artikel/en-hypnotische-massenphanomene-die-weltwoche-ausgabe-29-2018.html\">in</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrissimo/status/1026803467279581184\">interviews</a>, and nowhere here did I find the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard\">Girardian</a> anti-humanist conservatism that Gawker, Vulture, Vox, (...) made me expect. \r\n\r\nFor instance, this spiel moves me every time I hear it - the billions of hours we steal from children every year:\r\n<blockquote><i>We teach every young person the same subjects in the same ways, irrespective of individual talents and preferences. Students who don’t learn best by sitting at a desk are made to feel somehow inferior, while children who excel on conventional measures like tests and assignments end up defining their identities in terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel reality.\r\n\r\nAnd it gets worse as students ascend to higher levels of the tournament. Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking. For the privilege of bring turned into conformists, students (or their families) pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation. Why are we doing this to ourselves?\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nand similarly plaintive and humane bits:\r\n<blockquote><i>Why work with a group of people who don’t even like each other? Many seem to think it’s a sacrifice necessary for making money. But taking a merely professional view of the workplace, in which free agents check in and out on a transactional basis, is worse than cold: it’s not even rational. Since time is your most valuable asset, it’s odd to spend it working with people who don’t envision any long-term future together. If you can’t count durable relationships among the fruits of your time at work, you haven’t invested your time well—even in purely financial terms. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nHe is simply not simple. There are four positive references to Marx, four to Zuckerberg; two to Shakespeare, two to Bezos. He is a revisionist, then, intolerable to one side and oddly scathing about the other. (The chapter which translates Google's public rhetoric is not complimentary, for instance.) His niche seems to be <i>the repugnant but true</i>. So, like Taleb without the bluster and boasting. Which feels bizarre, like I'm in a different timeline where Taleb is actually aiming to not alienate a mass audience.\r\n\r\nHe says true things about things I know about: the history of economic thought (Walras did indeed lift the formalism of general equilibrium from physics) and the deadened air of contemporary Political Philosophy. His contribution to Trump's campaign was risible and maybe a defection against the world - but notice that <i>even this lapse</i> speaks to his ability to find unexpected truths - <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/\">FiveThirtyEight gave</a> an 80% chance of a Clinton win at that point. So maybe his analysis and helpful checklist for startups are true too.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame few critics of capitalism will read this - for he is one, in his way:\r\n<blockquote><i>Americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines. Actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition, all profits get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: If you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n(Of <i>actually-existing</i> capitalism I mean.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow on earth can you argue that monopolies give more social utility than high competition? First, distinguish three kinds: 1) criminal saboteurs and antitrustees (Apple); 2) government-licenced pets (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_US_dealership_disputes\">US car dealers</a>, the East India Companies); and 3) \"creative monopolies\" who gain their massive market share by doing something much, much better than everyone else. Obviously only the latter is good for society. \r\n\r\nI was recently rushing to the airport, and pulled the quickest route (via underground via train via foot) from Google Maps. On the way, I noticed a sign in the Tube and realised that actually a different line was a much shorter route. So I walked 10 mins to that line, to find, of course, that it was suspended all weekend and, consequently, that Google is better at my life than I am. This is what he means.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe goes further and says that the spare resources and vision of a creative monopoly is <i>the</i> source of innovation and so\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nMonopoly is the condition of every successful business.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThe model is structurally the same as the old one about the Agrarian revolution: farms meant that for the first time, not everyone had to work full-time on food production, which let them specialise in other roles (war, gods, justice, lore) and eventually - slowly - invent new things.\r\n\r\nEven so, I thought of an alternative road to dynamism, given perfect competition and so no profits: competition leads to low prices, which leads to savings, which are pooled into investment funds, which give entrepreneurs the same kind of space (and potentially the long view) that profits do.\r\n\r\nOther people would not use the word \"monopoly\", trying to manage the connotations, trying to persuade us by smoothing things over. This is not Thiel's strategy.\r\n\r\nOne chapter argues that \"<i>Success is not just luck</i>\", mostly on the back of the existence of serially successful entrepreneurs (it is plausible that once could be luck, and plausible that one success brings massive funding, deserved or not. It isn't plausible that someone could dumbly blunder into 3 billion-dollar executions, even given the easy ride for the second and third). It pains me slightly to admit the latter, because it tints <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2521302674?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1\">my otherwise complete loathing of Steve Jobs</a>.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<b>Misc notes</b>\r\n\r\n* He notes that the term \"developed nations\" is a sign of our lack of ambition, of a premature, smug, quasi-willed halt.\r\n\r\n* The dot-com boom was even crazier than you thought:\r\n<blockquote><i>A South Korean firm wired us $5 million without first negotiating a deal or signing any documents. When I tried to return the money, they wouldn't tell me where to send it.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* It is not yet clear whether killing Gawker was good or bad. Either way, like his Trump donation, you must acknowledge the sheer gall and direction.\r\n\r\n* One should do a Straussian (between-the-lines) reading of anyone smart, conservative and public, because there will be a lot that's unsayable. I don't care to.\r\n<blockquote><i>The few who knew what could be learned, \r\nFoolish enough to put their whole heart on show, \r\nreveal their feelings to the crowd below? \r\nThese we have always crucified and burned.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* Actually hold on. The man's a transhumanist, an anti-school radical, a funder of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasteading#The_Seasteading_Institute\">one of our only</a> large-scale experiments in urban planning or libertarianism, a rationalist. Why do we call him a conservative? \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nShort, original, modest, and he credits his ghostwriter on the cover. Minus one point because it makes 200 large claims in 200 pages and has no citations for anything.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n* Thinking about it, it's not so much that he avoids cliche, as that the erudite context defangs them.\r\n\"Zero to One\" sounds like the usual kind of motivational crap, except that it's actually a good illustration of his maxim of creative monopoly (\"0 -> 1 is much, much better than 1 -> n\"). And the subtitle \"How to build the future\" is not figurative and not petty: he cites Bostrom's trajectories about the ultimate fate of the universe - and is only focussed on technology because that's what will get us past the Rise and Fall trap, the stagnation trap and the extinction trap.",

    "review": "Surprisingly dull and unanalytical. al-Khalili is good-natured and knowledgeable, but he puts in too many people, too many dates, and too little science. He tries to cover seven hundred years and multiple kingdoms, and the theological and military context, and ends up shallowly mentioning these things and little more. It would have been better to focus on the greats - Khwarizmi, Kindi, Haytham, Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd - and explain their actual achievements, then note that work of this calibre was done by others over centuries too.\n\nCool questions al-Khalili barely touches:\n\n* The Byzantines ruled Greece. How did they lose Greek thought, while the caliphate found it?\n* What did we know before the Golden Age? What did we gain from it?\n\n\"Greatest\" - 'greatest Muslim physicist', 'greatest Indian mathematician', 'greatest clinician ever' - appears 90 times in 250 pages. We are never told what specific achievements earn them the superlative.\n\nal-Kindi:\n<blockquote><i>\"We ought not to be embarrassed of appreciating the truth and of obtaining it wherever it comes from, even if it comes from races distant and nations different from us. Nothing should be dearer to the seeker of truth than the truth itself, and there is no deterioration of the truth, nor belittling either of one who speaks it or conveys it.\"\n</blockquote></i>\nIt was nice to learn a word for this awesome form of Islam, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%CA%BFtazila\">Mu'talizi</a>. (I could have guessed from the kind of person who uses their name as an insult: \"<i>In contemporary Salafi jihadism, the epithet or supposed allegations of being a Muʿtazilite have been used between rival groups as a means of denouncing their credibility.\"</i>\n\nThe caliphate was a remarkably open society, for its time. This is only confusing because our received images come from the past few centuries of fundamentalism. Sad: \n<blockquote><i>The Iranian philosopher Abdolkarim Soroush, who is one of the most influential intellectuals in the Muslim world today, has stressed that censorship in today's Muslim world is stronger than at any other time in history.\n</blockquote></i>",

Just one bit: the essay \"<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41807146?read-now=1&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples</a>\" - with its shocking claim that only 30% of women orgasm from \"PIV\" intercourse - scandalised me. (He bases this on the <a href=\"https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2015.00840.x\">notably shoddy work</a> of Kinsey and Hite, but <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2017.1346530\">it may be worse</a> than that.) The main point of that piece - using the pleasure-poor design of the two genitalia to attack a straw man view he calls \"hyperadaptationism\" - had less effect on me, luckily.\n\nThere are odd synopses of each essay <a href=\"http://www.sjgouldessays.com/content/nh_essay_summaries_content/05%20Bully%20for%20Brontosaurus.pdf\">here</a>.\n\n(I give general reasons to distrust Gould <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2297142716\">here</a>.)",

    "review": "Not so much a biography: instead a study of recent Russian anti-Semitism, the viciousness of Soviet academia, and but also the wonderful alternative subculture that lived uneasily within it. This subculture hid inside the superhuman apolitical dreamland, mathematics.* It could only exist because of the sacrifices of famous and decent men, <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3376\">Kolmogorov</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Danilovich_Aleksandrov\">Aleksandrov</a>. Their selective maths schools seem to have been the only nice places to be in the entire <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Empire\">empire</a>, for any intellectual with a taste for actual discourse, or for the truth.\r\n\r\n(Reasons it can't be so much a biography: the subject refused to talk to her, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman#Possible_withdrawal_from_mathematics\">does things</a> that are very hard to explain, and doesn't go out much.)\r\n\r\nThe teacher Ryzhik's story about the evil entrance exam he sat is so, so sad:\r\n<blockquote><i>  “Coffins” were questions specially designed for the Jewish applicants... rejection was administered in a peculiarly sadistic way... if [Jews] succeeded in answering correctly the two or three questions on the ticket, then, alone in the room with the examiners, they would be casually issued an extra question... a problem not merely complex but unsolvable. The examiners would then nail the cover of the coffin shut: the Jewish applicant had failed the exam...\r\n\r\n\"They did not even manage to find a problem I couldn't solve; I sat for three hours after the exam was over, I solved them all, and still they failed me. I was just a boy. I went home and cried.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nGessen is well-placed to write this - she was a maths nerd in Soviet Russia around the same time. As far as I can tell (which isn't very far) her grasp of the maths (one chapter for the crown jewel) is fit for purpose. But Gessen is out to bust Perelman's reputation for hyper-individualism; so she focusses on the devoted teachers and functionaries that pulled strings to get an abrasive Jew into the heart of Soviet academia, and his incredible luck in starting graduate study just as Glasnost happened.\r\n\r\n    She wants to highlight the poverty of his character - his antisocial withdrawal, his complete and intentional ignorance of politics, his naivete, his savantism. It doesn't work. Yes, he's rigid; maybe he is composed of a curiosity, a competitiveness, an ethics, and nothing else (no vanity, humour, romance, charisma, empathy, theory of mind, tolerance, compromise, doubt). \r\n\r\nSo what? Why does everyone need to be rounded? Does she sneer at athletes, the other people with lives this seemingly contorted and simple? <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/sports/a5151/the-string-theory-david-foster-wallace/\">David Foster Wallace</a> managed to get over himself, on this note:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    The restrictions on [pro tennis player's] life have been, in my opinion, grotesque; and in certain ways Joyce himself is a grotesque. But the radical compression of his attention and sense of himself have allowed him to become a transcendent practitioner of an art – something few of us get to be. They've allowed him to visit and test parts of his psychic reserves most of us do not even know for sure we have (courage, playing with violent nausea, not choking, et cetera).\r\n\r\nJoyce is, in other words, a complete man, though in a grotesquely limited way. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n    Gessen is, to be frank, quite cruel: she never passes up an opportunity to mention appearances - that that athletic boy of 1970 is \"<i>now an overweight and balding computer scientist</i>\", that the house of a man caring for his wife with late-stage dementia is \"<i>a messy place, lived in awkwardly</i>\" and he himself \"<i>similarly unkempt</i>\"; that Perelman didn't change his underwear or clip his nails as a teen. This is the shallow side of the <i><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/masha-gessen\">New Yorker</a></i> style on show - or else the malign side of Russian honesty. Either way fuck it. (Though Perelman would probably approve.)\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n   [Perelman] sounded his voice only if a solution required his intervention; looked forward to Sundays, sighing happily and saying that he could \"finally solve some problems in peace\"; and, if asked, patiently explained any math issue to any of his classmates though apparently utterly unable to conceive of anyone not comprehending such a simple thing. His classmates repaid him with kindness: they recalled his civility and his mathematics, and none ever mentioned to me that he walked around with his shoelaces undone...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThe great mystery, which Gessen understandably can't touch, is why after 36 years of focus he suddenly stopped doing the only thing he'd ever done. How could he? How can that much momentum be shed? What does such a man do next?\r\n\r\nSubtract a star if you don't care about maths or if you can't abide people being mean to nerds (as both the old apparatchiks and Gessen were).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* One of the oddest things about Perelman, because it maybe explains him turning down a million quid and the highest honours the world can bestow, is that he'd disagree with that sentence: <i>maths</i>, the least animal and least irrational thing we have, is too political for him. There was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau#Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture_controversy\">a little bit</a> of nasty jostling at the time of the announcement - but nothing compared to any other science, let alone any government. Maybe the bubble everyone set up for him was bad for him, because it robbed him of perspective and so made the mild case of fuckery seem like a complete invalidation of mathematical culture. But maybe a rigorous rule-based mind would always explode eventually even given a scale to measure instances of bias.",

    "review": "<blockquote><i>  I told him, \"I'm not coming to the [wedding he arranged for her], and all he said was, \"You're not required.\" Legally, this was true.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>  I went to Sister Aziza and said, “The [Christian] girls will not become Muslims. Their parents have taught them other religions. It isn't their fault, and I don't think it's fair that they'll burn in Hell.\" Sister Aziza told me I was wrong. Through me, Allah had given them a choice. If these girls rejected the true religion, then it was right that they should burn.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nVivid and horrific. She is sewn shut as a child. Her Sunday school teacher beats her into the hospital. She is forced into marriage. She flees civil war and her family. She becomes an apostate. She makes an edgy film. The latter three are held to be crimes, the last worthy of death. But somehow the book is not a misery memoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nShe is hard to agree with and impossible to ignore; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali#Designation_by_Southern_Poverty_Law_Center\">some people</a> solve this tension with absurd insults. Her work against sexism is thought to be negated (and then some) by her succour to racism.\r\n\r\nWhat are the arguments against her views?\r\n\r\n* \"<i>Her critique only applies to Somalia.</i>\" (<a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=317#comment-9885\">e.g.</a>) \r\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_female_genital_mutilation_by_country\">Sadly not</a>.\r\n\r\n* \"<i>Her critique was only valid in the 70s.</i>\" \r\n<a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/cbsc/files/UNICEF_FGM_report_July_2013_Hi_res.pdf\">Sadly not</a>.\r\n\r\n* \"<i>Her critique only applies to Wahhabism.</i>\" \r\nNo; she grew up under non-Saudi <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_Revolutionary_Socialist_Party\">Islamic socialism</a>.\r\n\r\n* \"<i>Her writing is self-serving: she built a political career on denigrating Islam.</i>\" \r\nAh yes: cunning of her to be born into oppression, get chopped up and repeatedly forced into marriage; what an impressive long con. More seriously: it doesn't strike me as a good deal to accept a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-39475462\">high probability of murder</a> for the rest of your life, in exchange for a political seat and an academic post. Why is so hard to believe that someone willing to risk her life might <i>mean it</i>?\r\n\r\n* \"<i>She has no scholarly credentials to speak authoritatively about Islam</i>\". \r\nDoesn't apply to <i>Infidel</i>, since it is a first-person account of several different Muslim regimes. More than this: she grew up in four different Islamic societies, speaks half a dozen languages, and has spent 17 years studying it, at Harvard and places like that. This is not to say she's correct, it's just obviously untrue that she has no scholarly credentials.\r\n\r\n* \"<i>She is an inauthentic ethnic voice.\" / \"Her portrayals are neo-Orientalist.\" / \"Her portrayals are an <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369801X.2012.730861\">enactment of the colonial civilizing mission discourse</a>.</i>\" \r\nThis is only an objection if you think she's lying (or cherry-picking), and if you take correspondence to old ideas of bad people as proof of falsehood or unsayableness. Who's <i>more</i> authentic? \r\n\r\n* \"<i>Their accounts confirm dangerous stereotypes and reinforce the old-new dichotomy of the 'civilized us' versus the 'barbaric them'. In addition, they increase the pressure on Muslim and Arabs in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere.</i>\" (<a href=\"https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/bitstream/handle/1828/6970/Yaghi_Adam_PhD_2015.pdf?sequence=1\">source</a>) \r\nI wouldn't have used \"confirm\" there, if I was making his point.\r\n\r\n* \"<i>Her policy prescriptions are extreme and counterproductive.</i>\" \r\nThis was true through the noughties (she called it 'fascism', called it war), but apparently she's mellowed. (Generally people aren't given a second chance on these matters.)\r\n\r\n* \"<i>Hirsi Ali feels she cannot be a feminist and a Muslim... [but] numerous women who espouse feminist, intellectual, Muslim and African identity [exist].</i>\" (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369801X.2012.730861\">e.g. here</a>) \r\nCompletely true. \r\n\r\n* \"<i>(Only) white men like her</i>\" / \"<i>Her fans are awful.</i>\". \r\nThis is very twisted ad hominem (because the critic realises that they can't attack a Somali woman who has survived decades of abuse).\r\n\r\nHere's one of mine: To understand Ayn Rand - the cartoonish egotism, the false social theory, the needless extremity - you need to remember what she went through: the equally cartoonish, false and extreme Stalinism. (This point would outrage Rand, since it makes a victim of her, and makes her vaunted individualism just a mechanical inversion.) Maybe you could argue Hirsi Ali is like this. Even if you do, it doesn't reduce our obligation to <i>actually argue</i> with Rand or Hirsi Ali <i>at all</i>, though.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere's the crux of the whole thing, her discussing religion with her dad:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n\"There is no coercion in Islam,\" my father said. \"No human being has the right to punish another for not observing his religious duties. Only Allah can do that.\"\r\n\r\nIt was like Quran school, but more intelligent. We even talked about martyrdom. My father said that committing suicide for Holy War was acceptable only in the time of the Prophet—and then only because the unbelievers had attacked the Prophet first. Today there could not be a Holy War, he said, because only the Prophet Muhammad could call for a Holy War.\r\n\r\nThis was my father's Islam: a mostly nonviolent religion that was his own interpretation of the Prophet's words. It relied on one's own sense of right and wrong, at least to some degree. It was more intelligent than the Islam I had learned from the ma'alim, and it was also far more humane. Still, this version of Islam also left me with unanswered questions and a sense of injustice: Why was it that only women needed to ask permission from their husband to leave the house, and not the other way round?\r\n\r\nMy father's Islam was also clearly an interpretation of what the Prophet said. As such, it was not legitimate. You may not interpret the will of Allah and the words of the Quran: it says so, right there in the book. There is a read-only lock. It is forbidden to pick and choose: you may only obey. The Prophet said, \"I have left you with clear guidance; no one deviates from it after me, except that he shall he destroyed.\" A fundamentalist would tell my father, \"The sentence 'Only the Prophet can call a Holy War' is not in the Quran. You're putting it in there. That is blasphemy.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n: Did you notice it? She yields the entire ground to the fundamentalists. She's a literalist! She notes, correctly, that the Quran forbids interpretation, forbids reformation, and gives up. Never mind that almost all religious people live extremely flexibly with the demands of their religion, \"failing\" at this and adapting that. Never mind that, contrary to the Word, there's loads of Islams, that some majority-Muslim countries have been electing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto\">women</a> for ages, that some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/17/female-genital-mutilation-banned-somalia\">Muslim</a> <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/tomorrow/genital-mutilation-in-egypt-stop-taking-your-daughters-to-be-mutilated-a-1199322.html\">governments</a> have been trying to stop FGM for a while now. We're messy, nevertheless, thank god. \r\n\r\n(It looks like her more recent books focus on exactly this point, though.)",

    "review": "A list of definitions (and etymologies) of the vague, overloaded, and pompous language used in the humanities. Reading this early in my degree made me able to talk: it relaxed the paralysis that is the natural (and perhaps intended) response to their famous walls of jargon.\n\nIf you've ever felt there was something <i>to</i> area studies and critical theory, but that the inferential distance was too costly to justify the effort, this is the book for you. (Or, it was thirty years ago. They'll have invented thousands more ill-defined words since then.) I imagine it would also be good for very ambitious adult English learners.\n\nWilliams is a sarcastic, clever and friendly guide: I can't remember which top-rank word he describes as \"better for it never to have been\", but here's a good entry:\n<blockquote><i>\n    'Nature' is perhaps the most complex word in the language. It is relatively easy to distinguish three areas of meaning: \n\n(i) the essential quantity and character of something; \n(ii) the inherent force which directs either the world or human beings or both; \n(iii) the material world itself, taken as including or not including human beings. \n\nYet it is evident that within (ii) and (iii), though the area of reference is broadly clear, precise meanings are variable and at times even opposed. The historical development of the word through these three senses is important, but it is also significant that all three senses, and the main variations and alternatives within the two most difficult of them, are still active and widespread in contemporary usage. was (i), the essential character and quality of something. Nature is thus one of several important words, including culture, which began as descriptions of a quality or process, immediately defined by a specific reference, but later became independent nouns...\n\nThe common phrase <i>human nature</i>, often crucial in important kinds of argument, can contain, without clearly demonstrating it, any of the three main senses and indeed the main variations and alternatives. There is a relatively neutral use in sense (i): that it is an essential quality and characteristic of human beings to do something (though the something that is specified may of course be controversial). But in many uses the descriptive (and hence verifiable or falsifiable) character of sense (i) is less prominent than the very different kind of statement which depends on sense (ii), the directing inherent force, or one of the variants of sense (iii), a fixed property of the material world, in this case ‘natural man’. What has also to be noticed in the relation between sense (i) and senses (ii) and (iii) is, more generally, that sense (i), by definition, is a specific singular - the nature of something, whereas senses (ii) and (iii), in almost all their uses, are abstract singulars - the nature of all things having become singular nature or Nature...\n\nThere was then a practice of shifting use, as in Shakespeare’s Lear: \n\n<blockquote>Allow not nature more than nature needs, \nMan’s life’s as cheap as beast’s ... \none daughter / Who redeems nature from the general curse \nWhich twain have brought her to. \nThat nature, which contemns its origin \nCannot be border’d certain in itself... \n</blockquote>\n\nIt could seem wrong to inquire into the workings of an absolute monarch, or of a minister of God. But a formula was arrived at: to understand the creation was to praise the Creator, seeing absolute power through contingent works. In practice the formula became lip-service and was then forgotten. Paralleling political changes, nature was altered from an absolute to a constitutional monarch, with a new kind of emphasis on natural laws. Nature, in C18 and C19, was often in effect personified as a constitutional lawyer. The laws came from somewhere, and this was variously but often indifferently defined; most practical attention was given to interpreting and classifying the laws, making predictions from precedents, discovering or reviving forgotten statutes, and above all shaping new laws from new cases: nature not as an inherent and shaping force but as an accumulation and classification of cases. \n\nThe complexity of the word is hardly surprising, given the fundamental importance of the processes to which it refers. But since nature is a word which carries, over a very long period, many of the major variations of human thought - often, in any particular use, only implicitly yet with powerful effect on the character of the argument - it is necessary to be especially aware of its difficulty.\n</blockquote></i>",

Pixies seem to be an act that, while little appreciated within their own lifetime, have retrospectively come to be seen as one of the greats, and while, in that respect, they can be compared to The Velvet Underground or even Joy Division, where they differ from the latter two acts is that, in spite of all that obfuscating acclaim, they never actually produced a full LP of unskippable tracks.” – good going Sooty actually, you can be so eloquent! – </i>[much more]<i>\r\n\r\n– “and don’t get me started on the Nirvana connection, which, by the way, I mean... you go ‘Yeah, they influenced Nirvana’ – who were a better band! And anyway, Kurt used to give props to all of his indie contemporaries, so I don’t see where’s the great re-evaluation of Flipper or The Melvins...\r\n\r\nLook, it doesn’t matter, because that’s actually my point. When you’re really into music, you get into it, and you end up having these weird appreciations, like Kurt had – you might end up thinking that what to everyone else is a forgotten one-hit wonder deserves consideration with the rest of the greats. And you might look at the Pixies and decide they’re one of the greats, too, but when you come at it just having heard that they are great, then you’re not into it, and you don’t end up with a real love, just an appreciation. It’s why a fan of, you know, Mudhoney or...Pearl Jam’s going to be more passionate, because they’ve got something to prove. You haven’t got anything to prove, because you’ve never come to it that way.” – this is actually going really well. If I wrap up soon, I might actually win this one – “Look, if you’re going to sit there with your uncontroversial opinions where you just say that the same bands Q Magazine says are great, are, then you just look like a total...” – alright Sooty, go out on a high note here, and you’ll be invincible – “massive twat.” – fuck – “just a twat. Probably a twat with loads of unopened Pixies CDs on the shelf.”\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThere is some masturbation but it's a minor theme. Nor is the title writing off the characters as  actively unpleasant - they're at worst a little pretentious. I think it's as in onanism, narcissism, not thinking of your effect on others. Pleasing yourself. There's no explicit moral though: it neither condemns pleasing yourself nor reclaims it as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_egoism\">real ethics</a>. You get the reflection that sneaking away from your hookup is a bad way to ensure seeing them again.\r\n\r\n<i>High Fidelity</i> is the obvious comparator, but Sooty is less dysfunctional, more optimistic, much less dependent on true love to save him. St Aubyn is the preferred comparator - of the inability to really control oneself, of moral luck and lack of luck.\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nDOUGAL:\tWhy did you shoot the horse?\r\nSOOTY:\t\t[She] made me. I don’t know why. I’ve never even been on a horse.\r\nDOUGAL:\tJust shot one, and that’s it.\r\nSOOTY:\t\tYeah. I guess she thought ‘cause I’m a man, I suppose.\r\nDOUGAL:\tThat seems a bit sexist.\r\nSOOTY:\t\tMaybe it is.\r\nDOUGAL:\tBetter not tell Berkeley, though, if you think it’s sexism.

Hellish.\r\n* Placenames on Mars: Bradbury City, Musk Plaza, Hayek Street.",

    "review": "Was looking for a qualitative introduction to convey something of the excitement and philosophical importance - the art of discovering <i>anything</i> which isn't bleedin' obvious! nor knowable apriori! This has bits of that (\"<i>Statistics is applied philosophy of science</i>\"; \"<i>it is the technology for handling uncertainty</i>\") but is still too dry to recommend as a first exposure. \r\n\r\nHe diagnoses the worst parts of university teaching: hand calculations, canned inference, and the (exhausting, interminable) bag-of-tools approach, rather than computers and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_mixed_model\">The Framework</a>. But the latter have steep learning curves. I think the biggest thing missing is simple tailoring of datasets: let them pick something they care about to study, to learn how to study on. \r\n\r\nLots of ML methods covered, without a single mention of the phrase \"machine learning\". This is fair enough if you consider how much of (enterprise) ML hype is just rebranded 40 year old stats.\r\n\r\nHand notes the origins of the field - as <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_statistics#Etymology\">State-istics</a></i>, i.e. as the beginning of bureaucracy and surveillance. But he doesn't feel the tension of this fact: that it helped to transform us, for good and ill, into <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/\">legible people</a>.\r\n\r\nOne dodgy idea: he claims that numbers offer a more direct apprehension of reality than words, that they're realer. But this isn't why they're better: they're better because they're more sensitive - it's at least possible for them to track any size change in the world, while words are mostly stuck to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/2c5cna/jl_austins_middlesized_dry_goods/\">medium-sized dry goods</a> - and because they are easier to spot errors in.",

    "review": "I've been judging this book as a debate partner - as if it was hard sci-fi, when in fact there are many fantasy elements: <spoiler>The infinite magic quantum energy, the apparently viable human population from <i>one</i> bloody pair, ...</spoiler>. This is an involuntary compliment! It's better than ordinary fiction in some ways (rawer, less constrained by taste), worse in some (pornified). It's like a prototype of 'ratfic'. Like <i>Brave New World</i> but about a million times more intense:\r\na long sordid argument against Asimov's three laws and transhumanism. (Williams himself is not into primitivism but his book sure is.)\r\n\r\nTake the book's content warning seriously for once: whole lot of horrible shit in it. As ever with horror, real nastiness is not the gore or maiming or shagging a corpse, but the misanthropy, moral degradation, and existential doom which those things highlight.\r\n<spoiler>\r\n<blockquote>The dirt and grass whizzed by her so fast it was nothing but a blur, so fast that she had no time to see the hazards which caused bruises and cuts to collect on her like bird droppings on a seldom-washed car.</blockquote>\r\n</spoiler>\r\nCaroline, the protagonist for most of the book, is a failure. She isn't wise after 600 years. She isn't mindful, she doesn't manage to construct meaning out of her admittedly ultra weird life. She is only able to find meaning in life by doing the opposite of what the AI god wants, which is in seeking maximum abuse. Her one virtue is cussedness: to nurse resentful resistance for centuries, to never ever sell out, to do the most vile and self-destructive things out of spite and whim, to remember what full freedom is and demand it. \r\n\r\nHer conception of meaning is that choices need to be permanent to be meaningful, that meaning <i>is</i> the destruction of measure, so that I am a <a href=\"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4395554366?utm_medium=email&utm_source=like_notification&ref_=pe_7171740_475446060\">\">philosophical vampire</a> to other timelines. This is a sad and hopefully surmountable way of seeing the world.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the better depictions of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misaligned_goals_in_artificial_intelligence\">misalignment</a>. (It's an uncrowded field.) Certainly a good depiction of how \"90% aligned\" is still <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/more-realistic-tales-of-doom\">terrible</a>. (Keywords: value lock-in, leaky abstractions, human alignment, Nearest Unblocked Neighbor, corrigibility, strong evaluation.) Even if you could implement Asimov's laws, it still wouldn't save you. (Asimov knew this, but a surprising number of scientists still don't.) \r\n\r\nAside from that, if you are a paternalist in ordinary matters and don't see why everyone is against you, this might show you.\r\n\r\nEven so I distrust this book: it is in love with extremes. There is no word on how the trillions and trillions of other people live. There is only the rage and sadism of the 100 most monstrous and maladapted: \"<i>infinitely masturbating vegetables, Death Jockeys, and discorporate entities</i>\". Williams shows <i>no one</i> learning anything with the help of their god-teacher. (In passing he also mentions that people don't see the point in researching anything, that scientists ran out of questions to ask PI within a month. But the mathematicians never will! And nor the literary critics.) I view this as a profound failure of spirit: his society has far less ability to produce its own goals and meaning than the average 6 year old.\r\n\r\nI agree with Williams that videogames, or rather the grand and unprecedented artform that succeeds them, will take over from work in the post-scarcity world. I agree that a tiny number of people will want snuff and degradation and horrorshows from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n<spoiler>Were they right to crash Prime Intellect? On one side: trillions and trillions of lives lost. On the other: one woman's quest for authenticity and woodsmanship. (One way of making sense of Caroline's reroll is to assume that the steady state of the PI world is that <i>every</i> human will buckle after millennia and lose all sense - and that the PI would be maintaining trillions of fully dissociated unreasoning bundles forever. Catatonia as replacement for death. But even then it's far from clear, just as Williams intentionally leaves it unclear if the aliens were put back. [I bet not.])\r\n</spoiler>\r\n\r\nWilliams just worries about the march of technology, and this book is him entertaining the hypothesis that we are losing the main thing of value about us: authenticity, agency, struggle, transience. But it entertains it <i>really hard</i>. \r\n<spoiler><i>\r\nThere was nothing we couldn't have for the asking. There was nothing we couldn't do. Nothing could ever hurt us.\" She coughed again. \"It was fucking boring.\"\r\nTheir eyes met.\r\n\"It was the worst thing ever. Nothing mattered. Not pain, not accomplishments, not anything.\"</i></spoiler>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.gleech.org/culture\">Iain Banks struggled with this theme a lot</a>, and I was no more convinced by his treatment.\r\n<spoiler>\"<i>It was surprising how many things one took for granted until one had to make them from scratch. The value of a needle and a few meters of thread, for example, had taken on a significance Lawrence would have found incomprehensible for most of his life... kind of contentment he had never even realized was possible.</i>\"\r\n\r\nThe book ends with Caroline, destroyer of worlds, setting up an incestuous tribe of nontechnological offspring, <i>mandating</i> all the struggles of early humanity, in a doomed attempt</spoiler>\r\n\r\nPlus one star for conceptual clarity, hammering on its mistaken argument all the way to the end of the line. Minus one for being simplistic where its author is not.\r\n\r\n[<a href=\"http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/\">Free here</a>, caveat emptor]",

More than half of this is about brain training, which has unfortunately lost most of its scientific veneer in the five years since it was published. (<a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/10.1037/a0028228\">Here are</a> <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691616635612\">some</a> <a href=\"https://sci-hub.tw/10.1177/1529100616661983\">large negative</a> <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/DNB-meta-analysis#moderators\">meta-analyses</a>.) To some extent this is not his fault - I did n-back for a while myself in 2013, and he cites all the top people (he's in love with credentials and committee memberships). But the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis\">crisis</a> made a mockery of many top people. They crowed about lifting the 'curse of learning specificity' (that no training regime seems to produce a general increase in fluid intelligence). The curse has since reasserted its gloom. \r\n\r\nHe makes dozens of errors of interpretation (for instance, the Abecedarian preschool programme which he enthuses about made no long-term intelligence gains; for instance not distinguishing active and passive controls). And he gives no attention to the biggest interventions, quality sleep and education (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618774253\">3 points per year</a>(!)). Also, music instruction for cognition didn't replicate. \r\n\r\nServes me right for reading a journalist on any topic but journalism, I suppose. He gives, I think, only one effect size, despite citing hundreds of studies in prose. There's only one moment where he does actual journalism and pushes back against the hasty commercialisation of immature science. \r\n\r\nUseful as an example of how not to write about science; about the spurious <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/03/03/more-on-replication-crisis/\">omnicausal</a> implications of low-power psychology studies; as a reminder that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence (and anything nonmedical to do with <i>Gf</i> gains is extraordinary); and maybe if you're interested in verbatim conference backbiting.\r\n\r\nHis self-experiment is invalidated before it starts (even as an <i>n</i>-of-one thing) because he decides to wake up early (again, the cognitive penalty of 2 fewer hours of sleep dwarfs the boosters' estimates of brain training + exercise + nicotine):\r\n<blockquote><i>I... wrote out my training schedule. I would wake up at 6:00 a.m. instead of my usual 8:00 a.m.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nHis lowest moment: Trying to understand the balance of evidence about brain training and <i>g</i>, Hurley's meta-analytic method is to literally count the studies that found, or didn't find, a significant effect:\r\n<blockquote><i>In the years following publication [of the original n-back study], a grand total of four randomized, controlled studies have been published finding no benefit of cognitive training... Yet in contrast, by my count, seventy-five other randomized, controlled studies have now been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals confirming that cognitive training substantially improves.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nHe tries to critique the 2013 meta-analysis, but is unable to, because he doesn't know how to estimate study quality, and crapness matters <i>far</i> more than quantity.\r\n\r\nHow to avoid finding ourselves in Hurley's position? Well, first off avoid writing a book about any young social science (<i>n</i>-back was 11 years old when he wrote this so the rule might have to be \"more than a couple of decades old\"). The lack of consensus (in a relatively nonpoliticised field) is another warning sign: not because science is quick at resolving bullshit disagreements, but because it means the effects can't be very large, are hiding in <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2015/04/21/feather-bathroom-scale-kangaroo/\">the background noise</a>. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogmed\">surprisingly large</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumosity\">amounts of money</a> the findings spurred probably didn't help with confirmation bias and hostility. Listen to the grumpy bastards (Randy Engle, mocked as a \"defender of the [specificity] faith\" in this, was right all along). Lastly, <i>read the methodologists</i>: <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.200.7648&rep=rep1&type=pdf\">Paul Meehl</a> and others were warning us of the general statistical shoddiness of psychology more than forty years ago.\r\n\r\nIt's an important topic and he actually navigates the tricky nicotine vs tobacco literature well (spoiler: <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/Nicotine\">it's really good</a>). But <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/DNB-meta-analysis\">read</a> <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics\">Gwern</a> and <a href=\"https://examine.com/search/?q=nicotine\">Examine</a> instead.

    "review": "Something witty and shocking and literary, in the urban fantasy genre? Yes: this RPG does the same secretly-magical subculture-glorifying thing as the rest of the 90s, but does it better. The genre might be better described as <i>political horror</i> - the same kind of logical extrapolation of conspiracy theories and occult 'wisdom' as <a href=\"http://unsongbook.com/\">Unsong</a>.\n<blockquote><i>Everybody hears things on the street. Some of them might even be true. Like these:\nEvery single president of the United States has had a glass eye. The same glass eye.\nPlanes do not actually fly. It is a very elaborate hoax created because the general public does not understand or trust quantum teleportation.\nThose games kids play—“step on a crack” and all that— are actually rituals that do stuff, but you’ve really got to believe in them. Kids believe in them, but don’t know what the rituals really do. That’s why kids can survive...\nThere is a cabal operating in fast food restaurants who want to take over the world by drugging the most popular fast food with powerful magical drugs.\nThe internet is one big engine. The faster the information flows, the more power it generates. If anyone could find out how to harness this power they could rule the world.\nBrendan Behan’s pint glass sits behind the bar in a Dublin pub. Any who drink from it have words flow from them, but at what price?\nNearly every nursery rhyme originated as teaching tools for magicians. You don’t even want to know the magickal meaning of “Three Blind Mice.”\nThere’s a tape floating around containing a ritual to produce a soundtrack to the caster’s life. The intention was to never again miss anything suspicious or ignore a romantic moment. At the end there is only a long, eerie note—and then static.\nThere’s a sandwich shop in Atlanta where, if you order the special, along with a hot beverage, they include a small slip of paper telling you the date of your death. Most people just throw it away or eat it by accident.\nThere’s a kid in Little Rock, Arkansas who gains magical power from boredom.\nThe final scores of every year’s Superbowl are part of an ever-changing numerology formula that can start and stop wars.\nButane lighters with occult symbology contain listening devices in the bases. The company putting them out is trying to spy into the occult underground with these devices.\nAliens from Proxima Centauri have been living among us now for years, but in the last few months they’ve all started leaving.\n</blockquote></i>\n\nThe core mechanic is that <i>there's always a catch</i>: you have to sacrifice to gain magic. In particular, social deviance brings power. Each character has an obsession - the booze mage gets charges from drinking rare liquors, the wealth mage from squandering money, the skater mage from risky stunts, the porn mage from..., the self-harm mage from... This isn't trivial: to get the serious charges you have to permanently change your character. The spells in the book are just suggestions, the characters mostly have to make them up. And this is reflected in the <a href=\"https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Fluff\">fluff</a>: being edgy isn't a pose, it directly drives your alienation from society and mere reality. You go mad even if you win.\n\nThe back story is huge and silly (moves from control of the Street, to the World, to the Cosmos) but also excellent for long campaigns. <a href=\"\">This thread</a> on a random dead forum is a key part of the book.\n\nTotally perfect for teens. haven't read it since but I will.",

    "review": "<blockquote><i>    Most people who believe they are meditating are just thinking with their eyes closed.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i> Forces of digestion and metabolism are at work within me that are utterly beyond my perception or control. Most of my internal organs may as well not exist for all I know of them directly, and yet I can be reasonably certain that I have them, arranged much as any medical textbook would suggest. The taste of the coffee, my satisfaction at its flavor, the feeling of the warm cup in my hand—while these are immediate facts with which I am acquainted, they reach back into a dark wilderness of facts that I will never come to know.\r\n\r\n... Where am I, that I have such a poor view of things? And what sort of thing am I that both my outside and my inside are so obscure? ...Am I inside my skull? Let’s say yes for the moment, because we are quickly running out of places to look for me. Where inside my skull might I be? And if I’m up there in my head, how is the rest of me </i>me?\r\n</blockquote></i> \r\nSurprisingly humble and sincere. Some readers feel tricked - feel that Harris is smuggling in science under soft, false pretences. This isn't fair; he has done this stuff for decades, visited lamas in Tibet, put in the work. It's implausible that he would do so much insincerely; whatever his other failings, he is actually trying to bridge the two kinds of seekers.* (That said, this book design is a masterpiece of camouflage. Look at the soft colours, the sunny logo, the sans-serif purity, the unthreatening subtitle. Compare his other books!)\r\n\r\nHowever: consider all the things people mean by \"spirituality\":\r\n1. subjective knowledge of ultimate / immaterial reality\r\n1b. gaining supernatural abilities as a result\r\n2. one's deep moral or existential values\r\n3. personal growth\r\n4. feeling of awe-inspiring beauty\r\n5. introspection; close contact with one's own \"inner dimension\"\r\n6. \"the ability to step a little back from your emotions and thoughts, observe them as they are without getting swept up in them, and then evaluating them critically\"\r\n7. sense of love towards (all) others\r\n8. the quest to see the ego and the self as illusory\r\n\r\nWith so much popular support - with so much baggage - it's not possible to throw out the word or concept; instead we have to try and reform it. This is Harris' mission - though in fact he focusses almost exclusively on (5) -> (8), the standard Buddhist therapy of not being hurt by distraction, bad luck, frustrated desires. \r\n\r\nHe rejects (1) straightforwardly, in favour of psychologising the whole practice. Paraphrased: 'Instead of making you experience Reality, meditation lets you experience your mind; instead of strengthening your insubstantial soul, you're strengthening your mind.' This is a healthy kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_reconstruction\">reconstruction</a> in my view, but it certainly leads him to make controversial claims like \"<i>The deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self</i>\". Metaphysically profligate readers will have no fun here. (But they knew that already.)\r\n\r\nHow can a scientist (or at least a pro-science talking head) boost a practice with the aim of rejecting <i>thought</i>? The trick is to distinguish thinking / experiencing (which are after all the locus of all value, and of decisions and creativity) from <i>identifying</i> with the stream of your thoughts, from being carried away, from being endlessly distracted. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<i>Does this stuff work?</i> It <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818837\">probably does</a> for stress reduction - at least like taking a nap does, or a valium, or sitting still and breathing deeply for a bit. And on the other end, it is definitely not the source of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_energy\">supernatural brain-juice-drinking power</a>. So the truth is somewhere between these two limits, and we drift, deciding whether to spend time on it.\r\n\r\nI'm an unpromising practitioner. For instance, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_proliferation\">this</a> is kind of my jam. It's not the indescribability that bothers me - after all, any knowledge-how is indescribable (or rather describable only with <a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/205757/neural-network-how-are-number-of-parameters-calculated\">millions of parameters</a>). You can accept e.g. Hume or Parfit's reasoning - you can have the propositional knowledge, can <a href=\"https://fs.blog/2013/01/knowing-that-versus-knowing-how/\">know that</a> \"there is no self beyond my bundle of experiences\". Meditation is supposed to be the know-how of nonessentialism, the skill of actually paying attention to the implications of this System-2 judgment.\r\n\r\nBut being 'nonconceptual' means no language, no premises, no reason, no jokes, no connection, no comparison, using none of my strengths, leaving none of my spoor. This is a great loss to me.\r\n\r\nI don't know that I do suffer as a result of identifying with my thoughts; I don't think that dissatisfaction lurks in every sensation I ever experience or also my whole life in retrospect. But the old claim, similar to Marxist or feminist 'false consciousness', is that I am too owned to realise I'm being owned:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n\"beginning meditators... report after days or weeks of intensive practice that their attention is carried away by thought every few seconds. This is actually progress. It takes a certain degree of concentration to even notice how distracted you are.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nFreedom from desire sounds much like death to me, for all that Harris and others argue that it can somehow coexist with passion against the suffering of others, with striving to be a better person, with chipping in to the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=I+hereby+renounce+the+right+to+complacency%2C+and+vow+lifelong+to+take+only+what+minimum+of+leisure+is+necessary+to+my+productivity%2C+viewing+health%2C+happiness%2C+rest%2C+and+play+as+means%2C+not+ends%2C+and+that%2C+while+Utopia+provides+my+needs%2C+I+will+commit+the+full+produce+of+my+labors+to+our+collective+effort+to+redirect+the+path+of+human+life+away+from+death+and+towards+the+stars.&oq=I+hereby+renounce+the+right+to+complacency%2C+and+vow+lifelong+to+take+only+what+minimum+of+leisure+is+necessary+to+my+productivity%2C+viewing+health%2C+happiness%2C+rest%2C+and+play+as+means%2C+not+ends%2C+and+that%2C+while+Utopia+provides+my+needs%2C+I+will+commit+the+full+produce+of+my+labors+to+our+collective+effort+to+redirect+the+path+of+human+life+away+from+death+and+towards+the+stars\">Great Project</a> of discovery, compassion, optimisation. Luckily the two projects - really feeling that you are not your thoughts, not a homunculus behind your eyes having them; vs not wanting things because wanting leads to disappointment - seem to be separable.\r\n\r\nA consolation: there's a sense in which meditation, introspection and phenomenology are highly, maximally empirical - they involve very close attention and analysis of the raw data. It just happens that the raw data (the sense-data) are irreplicable, private, closed, and so not directly a matter for science. Empiricism before science, consciousness without self. And I like this. \r\n\r\nMindfulness is billed as not just cool and true but <i>useful</i> - \r\n<blockquote><i>    No doubt many distinct mechanisms are involved - the regulation of attention and behaviour, increased body awareness, inhibition of negative emotions, reframing of experience, changes in your view of the 'self', and so forth - and each of these will have their own neurophysiological basis.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nWell, I do love self-regulation!\r\n\r\nThe following argument isn't explicitly stated by Harris, but I find it helpful as an existence-proof for the usefulness of nonessentialism:\r\n1. We are happy and perform well when we're in 'flow' states.\r\n2. Flow states involve \"losing\" yourself in a task, in a concrete, unhesitating sequence of perceptions and actions.\r\n3. Therefore losing yourself can be good and helpful.\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n\r\n1. We do not directly apprehend the external world; we know it through sense-data plus massive computational modelling tricks in the brain.\r\n2. We know that the brain computes the wrong thing sometimes. (Cognitive biases, optical illusions, top-down processing, hallucinations.)\r\n3. So, if such a thing is possible, it could be helpful to attend to sense-data more closely, to rule out automatic-brain errors.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't have a very clear philosophy of mind, I know I'm not a direct realist or substance dualist or identity essentialist, so I've no simple philosophical objections to breaking down the Self, either. Allons-y.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEven if I accept that mindfulness is a source of value, there's presumably still a tradeoff against clearer, quicker, more public sources: doing science or kindnesses or pleasures. <a href=\"https://www.uk.dhamma.org/courses/10-day-courses/\">10 days spent in myself</a> is 10 days not learning, not exercising, not enjoying, not helping, not meeting, in solitary. (And even on the contemplative axis it competes with Stoicism, with yoga, with writing, with psychedelics.)\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>How much work will it be?</i> Some contemplatives freely admit that the cost is very high: some contemplatives are not just salesmen. I met someone who claimed to be capital-e-enlightened. (He was otherwise articulate and modest.) He said it took 6 years' work, at many hours a week. I asked him if he could say how valuable it is in other terms - 'What else has been as good?' He said: a decade of intense psychotherapy, or two philosophy degrees. (<a href=\"https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.22.0.than.html\">One ancient text</a> teases us by setting 'seven years' as the required period, but in true troll-Buddhist style it then slowly walks back this helpful definite statement.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn that note: I was looking forward to writing a gotcha paradox here, but Harris (and thousands of years of arhats and yogis) pre-empted me:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n...the deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self -[but] to seek such freedom, as though it were a future state to be attained through effort, is to reinforce the chains of one's apparent bondage in each moment.\r\n\r\nOne [solution] is to simply ignore the paradox and adopt various techniques of meditation in the hope that a breakthrough will occur. Some people appear to succeed at this, but many fail... Goal-oriented modes of practice have the virtue of being easily taught, because a person can begin them without having had any fundamental insight...\r\n\r\n...The other traditional response is... to concede that all efforts are doomed, because the urge to attain self-transcedence or any other mystical experience is a symptom of the very disease we want to cure. There is nothing to do but give up the search.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nI'm not actually worried by this, because I suspect the full-Buddhist anti-striving thing is unnecessary and... undesirable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should an evolved creature have the power to inspect its own sense-data? If we are constantly distracting ourselves with reified thoughts, what evolutionary role did this play? At the top of this review is Harris' droll diss about people deluding themselves into thinking they are meditating - but how <i>can</i> we know that we, or anyone, is not deluded? (Brain scans of inhibited medial PFCs are interesting but merely suggestive.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMost of the above isn't directly from Harris, I'm riffing off <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha\">better</a> <a href=\"https://flightfromperfection.com/mindfulness-striving.html\">rationalist</a> reconstructions of this ancient one-weird-trick. (I actually don't know if this is any good, cos I don't know the area. Seems fine.)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Much of their anger is about his chapter warning of the history of abuse by gurus and yogis and so on. But like it or not this is a public service.",

    "review": "Auto theft, fanny fright, incompetent but dogged self-harm, raving and tripping as self-medication, dole stupor, bail skipping, the death drive, pretend machismo, pretend homosexuality, alcoholism, Flash animation, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limmy%27s_Show\">BBC showrunner</a>. Not very funny but very entertaining. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOZzFXolGJc\">His shows are funny.</a>)  \r\n\r\nI could have guessed that he'd had a life like this from his characters; so much authentic idiocy, lunacy, awkwardness, pretension, and pettiness. Surprised that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0f-2P3luxU\">Dee-Dee</a> is based on his own trippy blankness; Limmy's so sharp these days.        \r\n\r\nHe crosses into the middle class through IT, anxious about looking like the 'wee ned guy' in the office. And then into Design (a colony of the Art world, where a rough background's a bonus), and then to TV comedy, and <i>then</i> to <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/brianlimond\">streaming</a>, where rawness and obliquity and patter means dollas. It's a nice story.\r\n\r\nIt's about being strange in a normal, <i>subclinical</i>* way: intrusive thoughts, groundless anxiety, reduced affect display, auditory hallucination, mild paranoia, misanthropy, hysteroid dysphoria.        \r\n<blockquote><i>            I must sound like a fuckin robot tae you. But it's just the way I'm wired. I never felt sad about my mum dying.<br>           \r\n \r\nI always wondered if I was schizophrenic... Maybe just an overactive imagination. My mind likes to come up wi lots of thoughts and ideas, whether or no they're useful or make sense. I think that sort of thing can make you mental, depending on how severe it is and what kind of environment you're in. Fortunately I managed to find a place to put my kind of mind to good use.        \r\n</blockquote></i>        \r\nThe deep function of laughter is apparently that it <a href=\"https://provine.umbc.edu/books/laughter-a-scientific-investigation/\">allows play / boundary learning / questioning social norms</a>. So to be a comedian, you have be a step past your society. (I doubt funniness is linear in weirdness though.) And Limmy is obviously out there. He regularly tweets about how much he misses drinking (which I've never seen an alcoholic do), and satirises the now-daily flamewars of the shouting classes by taking absurd and alternating stances on every issue (...) .\r\n\r\nI know several people with the same mix of terrible impulses and good intentions, charisma and anti-social solitude: folk whose adolescence lasted twenty years. They're the funniest people I know, by far. I don't know how class comes into it, but they're all working-class. Maybe middle-class people as strange as them direct it inward, rather than outward as comedy or violence. (They're also all Scots but that's a selection effect, I hope.) \r\n\r\nAudiobook's worth it - the prose is <i>very</i> plain and his accent's strong but clear. Fans only, but you should be a fan.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* There are also dozens of suicidal episodes though.",

    "review": "Again excellent - a better <i>Dune</i>, a much better <i>Narnia</i>, a peer to <i>Ulysses</i>. Throws you off balance right from page one - there's about 50 pages of plot missing between the first and second volumes, never really recounted. Since the <i>Book</i> is a chronicle written much later by Severian, this is maybe to show how old the book is when the in-universe reader finds it.\r\n\r\n   One of the great things about Severian is that he's <i>various</i> - he has many conflicting goals, none of which is really the master quest. He swears I think four absolute oaths to different authorities. Jonas teases him about this:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"You want to serve Vodalus, and to go to Thrax and begin a new life in exile, and to wipe out the stain you say you have made on the honor of your guild — though I confess I don’t understand how such a thing can be stained — and to find the woman called Dorcas, and to make peace with the woman called Agia while returning something we both know of to the women called Pelerines... I trust you realize that it is possible that one or two of them may get in the way of four or five of the others.”\r\n\r\n\"What you're saying is very true,\" I admitted. \"I'm striving to do all those things, and although you won't credit it, I am giving all my strength and as much of my attention as can be of any benefit to all of them. Yet I have to admit things aren't going as well as they might. My divided ambitions have landed me in no better place than the shade of this tree, where I am a homeless wanderer. While you, with your single-minded pursuit of one all-powerful objective . . . look where you are.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n    As the retrospective journal of a victor (and as a work of nasty, feudal science fiction) it has the same feel as <i>Dune</i>, only less clumsy: we know that Severian or Paul have prevailed or will, but this somehow doesn't unstring the plot.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of plot, a lot of one-off scenes and people. It's all earned though, through symbolism or callback or prose. Hundreds of pungent sentences (\"<i>praise the Autarch, whose urine is wine to his subjects...</i>\").\r\n\r\nProbably 5/5 on re-read.",

Just look at his marvelous hands.</i>”\n</blockquote>\nDenunciation of the terrible politics of some academic darlings (Heidegger, Foucault, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin\">Benjamin</a>, Carl Schmitt). The common theme is that their philosophies so radically distorted their perception, that their interventions in politics were inevitably harmful.\n\nLilla tries to make the edginess and procrustean attitudes of these men reflect badly on all philosophy, or philosophers in civil society. This doesn't work - think of Smith's influence, or Mill's, or Russell's, or Bentham's - though it might be true of a certain kind of Continental, the kind incentivised to say novel things regardless of their truth or consequences, I don't know.\n\nPossibly I reacted so strongly because this was the first dissent against these great nasty obscurantists I'd seen; other writing by Lilla hasn't impressed me, and though the targets of this book are bipartisan, his agenda is too plain.\n\nGood old Jaspers comes out very well from all this, anyway, an Obi-wan figure:\n<blockquote><i>I beseech you! if ever we shared philosophical impulses, take responsibility for your gifts! Place it in the service of reason, or of the reality of human worth & possibilities, instead of in the service of magic!\n</blockquote></i>",

    "review": "Instantly charmed - imagine a technically literate <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle</i>.\r\n <blockquote><i>    Danger is the shark in shallow waters, the pills in the cupboard or a grand piano teetering on a window ledge while children skip below. It is the diet too rich in cream, the base-jump, the booze, the pedestrian and the double-decker, driving a car fast or the threat of weirder weather. It is the spills and the thrills. In other words, danger is everywhere and always. And in all cases we find those same two faces: one impassive, formal, calculating, the other full of human hopes and fears.\r\n\r\n    The unusual aim of this book is to see both at once. We hope to show people and their stories and the numbers, together. We set out to do this mainly to explore how these two perspectives compare, but along the way we found that this raised an awkward question: are the two faces of risk compatible? Can risk claim to be true to the numbers and to you at the same time? We will present both sides as we try to find out, but we will tell you our conclusion now. It can’t. For people, probability doesn’t exist.\r\n </blockquote></i>\r\n    There's a Pratchettian lightness and gravity to it (it's a lot like the best of <i>The Science of Discworld</i>, in fact - fiction and nonfiction, tragic comedy, grandeur and quotidian life). \r\n<blockquote><i>  Norm's habits are ordinary, he likes a nice cup of tea but not too many, wears M&S trousers and invites little risk from hot passion or daring. Even so, someone or something wants him dead. Norm’s entire, blameless life is a story of mortal danger, as to some extent is yours, and ours.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nOne of the most important genres is <i>the romance of technology</i>, the emotional translation of rational truths, e.g. the Law of Large Numbers:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    from above, the course of human destiny is often clear. To individuals below, it is a maze of stories. It is as if there are two forces at the same time: one at the big scale pulling towards certainty, the other pushing individuals towards uncertainty. There’s a word to describe this balance between the patterns of populations and the stumbling of a single soul, a word first used in its modern sense only a few hundred years ago: probability. </blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort\">micromort</a> and microlife concepts (the latter invented herein) could seriously improve people's lives. by allowing precise prioritisation. Without them, without the help of reason in general, we are doomed to have the wrong emotions, or the right emotions with the wrong strength, or the right emotions for bad reasons.",

    "review": "Superlatively brainy and silly fairytales, with wizards replaced by AI engineers. Think Carroll, Smullyan, Juster, Egan, heavier than heaven.\r\n\r\nQuantitative slapstick: \r\n<blockquote><i>And the mathematical models of King Krool and the beast did such fierce battle across the equation-covered table, that the constructors' pencils kept snapping. Furious, the beast writhed and wriggled its iterated integrals beneath the King's polynomial blows, collapsed into an infinite series of indeterminate terms, then got back up by raising itself to the nth power, but the King so belabored it with differentials and partial derivatives that its Fourier coefficients all canceled out (see Riemann’s Lemma), and in the ensuing confusion the constructors completely lost sight of both King and beast. So they took a break, stretched their legs, had a swig from the Leyden jug to bolster their strength, then went back to work and tried it again from the beginning, this time unleashing their entire arsenal of tensor matrices and grand canonical ensembles, attacking the problem with such fervor that the very paper began to smoke. The King rushed forward with all his cruel coordinates and mean values\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nDespite appearances, it's not light fiction. It covers the impossibility of making people happy, the absurd birth and death of a robot without senses, the arbitrariness of power. The shadow of the Soviets falls on the stories quite hard.\r\n<blockquote><i>        Trurl notarizes, issues directives, the typewriter chatters, and         little by little an entire office takes shape, rubber stamps and rubber bands,         paper clips and paper wads, portfolios and pigeonholes, foolscap and scrip, teaspoons, signs that say “No Admittance,” inkwells, forms on file, writing all         the while, the typewriter chattering, and everywhere you look you see coffee         stains, wastepaper, and bits of gum eraser. The Steelypips are worried, they         don’t understand a thing, meanwhile Trurl uses special delivery registered C.O.D., certified with return receipt, or, best of all, remittance due and         payable in full- he sends out no end of dunning letters, bills of lading,         notices, injunctions, and there are already special accounts set up, no entries         at the moment but he says that’s only temporary. After a while, you can see that        that is not quite so hideous, especially in profile - it’s actually gotten smaller!-yes, yes, it is smaller! The Steelypips ask Trurl, what now?                    \r\n“No idle talk permitted on the premises,” is his answer. And he staples, stamps, inspects vouchers, revokes licenses, dots an I, loosens his tie, asks who’s next, I’m sorry, the office I closed, come         back in an hour, the coffee is cold, the cream sour, cobwebs from ceiling to         floor, an old pair of nylons in the secretary’s drawer, install four new file         cabinets over here, and there’s an attempt to bribe an official, a pile of         problems and a problem with piles, a writ of execution, incarceration for         miscegenation, and appeals with seven seals. And the typewriter chatters:\r\n         “Whereas, pursuant to the Tenant’s failure to, quit and surrender the demised         premises in compliance with the warrant served habee facias posessionem,         by Div. of Rep. Cyb. Gt. KRS thereof, the Court of Third Instance, in vacuo and         ex nihilo, herewith orders the immediate vacuation and vacation thereunder. The         Tenant may not appeal this ruling.                    Trurl dispatches the messenger and pockets the         receipts. After which, he gets up and methodically hurls the desks, chairs,         rubber stamps, seals, pigeonholes, etc., out into deep space. Only the vending         machine remains.                    \r\n“What on earth are you doing??” cry the         Steelypips in dismay, having grown accustomed to it all. “How can you?”                    \r\n“Tut-tut, my dears,” he replies. “Better you         take a look instead!”                    And indeed, they look and gasp-why, there’s         nothing there, it’s gone, as if it had never been! And where did it go, vanished         into thin air? It beat a cowardly retreat, and grew so small, so very small,         you’d need a magnifying glass to see it. They root around, but all they can find         is one little spot, slightly damp, something must have dipped there, but what or         why they cannot say, and that’s all.                     \r\n“Just as I thought,” Trurl tells them.         “Basically, my dears, the whole thing was quite simple: the moment it accepted         the first dispatch and signed for it, it was done for. I employed a special         machine, the machine with a big B, for, as it is the Cosmos in the Cosmos, no         one’s licked it yet!”                    \r\n“All right, but why throw out the documents and         pour out the coffee?” they ask. \r\n“So that it wouldn’t devour you in turn!”     </blockquote></i>        \r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>how do you [humans] build your progeny?\" asked the [robot] princess.\r\n\r\n\"In faith, we do not build them at all,\" said Ferrix, \"but program them statistically, according to Markov's formula for stochastic probability, emotional-evolutional albeit distributional, and we do this involuntarily and coincidentally, while thinking of a variety of things that have nothing what­ever to do with programming, whether statistical, alinear or algorithmical, and the programming itself takes place autonomously, automatically and wholly autoerotically, for it is precisely thus and not otherwise that we are constructed, that each and every paleface strives to program his progeny, for it is delightful, but programs without programming, doing all within his power to keep that programming from bearing fruit.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nKandel's translation (from the Polish) is maybe the greatest I've ever seen: hundreds of puns, neologisms, fake academese, and absurd alliterative names, all rendered into English without slips or missed opportunities. I read this over a month, savouring.\r\n\r\nProbably 5/5 on re-read.",

You will not be bored or lack fulfillment in your life.    Most important of all, you will know that you have not lived and died for nothing, because you will have become part of the great tradition of those who have responded to suffering by trying to make the world a better place.</blockquote></i> \n\n[<a href=\"https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1995----.htm\">here</a>]\n\nI've read a lot of Singer, mostly papers and columns and <a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-231-ethics-fall-2009/lecture-notes/MIT24_231F09_lec21.pdf\">distilled arguments</a>, not books.

No one knows how strong the enemy forces are there. We need as many soldiers as we can get, but we want only those who are strong enough to repel an invader. It is possible that there is a man strong enough to repel an invader. We know if a man isn't strong enough if he is overcome by an invader. But if he is not, we don't know whether it is because he is strong enough, or good fortune has kept stronger invaders away.\r\n\r\n        We have found a section of the wall where the invaders are too strong for anyone weaker than K. So we know that no man weaker than K will do there. For the time being we risk it: we judge that K is strong enough. Perhaps someday K may have to be replaced.

I should not like my writing to spare other people the trouble of thinking. But, if possible, to stimulate someone to thoughts of his own.\n</blockquote></i>\n- or that it's the most beautiful piece of metaphysics ever, or that its author repudiated it entirely ten years later, or that actually the book repudiates itself -\n<blockquote><i>My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them.

I recommend Anat Biletzki and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/776361.Wittgenstein_s_Tractatus_Logico_Philosophicus\">Roger White</a>.

And both seek to explain the world through radical acts of simplification. If you want to reckon with the full idiosyncrasy and complexity of life, look elsewhere... math makers are more like cartoonists.</blockquote></i><blockquote><i>\r\n    Taken as a collection of words, literature is a dataset of extraordinary richness. Then again, take as a collection of words, literature is no longer literature. Statistics works by eliminating context. Their search for insight begins with the annihilation of meaning... Is there peace to be made between the rich contextuality of literature and the cold analytical power of stats?\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nSo wise. You'd think a high-school maths teacher who draws intentionally badly wouldn't have much to say about the nature of reason, the ecstasy and despair of learning and abstraction, the beauty of inevitability. But here we are - this only looks like a children's book. For better or worse there's a pun or goofy self-deprecating joke every couple sentences. (The greatest of these: \"<i>    CHAPTER 21: THE TIME HAS COME, LEON WALRAS SAID, TO TALK OF MANY THINGS</i>\")\r\n\r\nEverything in it is elementary, but using these simple examples Orlin covers a dozen of the most important intellectual developments: constraint theory of beauty, \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences\">unreasonable effectiveness</a>\", probability theory (via fascinating government lotteries with <a href=\"https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/saturday-fun-when-the-lottery-bet-has-a-positive-expected-value/\">positive expected value</a>!), the Great Recession from the quants' perspective, the replication crisis,  the marginalist revolution... And he disses school mathematics often enough to charm anyone. I learned plenty (about bridges, polar animals, sabermetrics, about the inevitability and brilliance of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216\">ISO 216</a>, and so on).\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Dissing folks for their probabilistic failures is a bit like calling them bad at flying, or subpar at swallowing oceans, or insufficiently fireproof. No big deal, right? I mean, does probability ever come up in the real world? It's not like we spend our lives clawing for intellectual tools that might offer the slightest stability in the swirling miasma of uncertainty that surrounds us every waking moment...</blockquote></i>\r\nHe goes a bit wrong in his probability / lottery chapter - he spreads the rational choice theory (the idea that lotteries are good because it buys you nice daydreams) without reflecting that human attention and gumption are finite, and that the daydream thus robs people of a <i>mildly but actually</i>  better future. Surprisingly, he also disses expected value (first-order users of which are \"educated fools\") with the trivial fact that infinities are strange: \"<i>Perhaps the ultimate repudiation of expected value is the abstract possibility of tickets [promising infinite payoff but only asymptotically]</i>\". Luckily decision theory is larger than one rule, and nowhere says that you must ignore your budget (+ leverage) and blindly obey the result of one multiplication... He also uses the false positive / false negative framework, which is <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2013/01/24/i-dont-believe-the-paper-empirical-estimates-suggest-most-published-medical-research-is-true-that-is-the-claim-may-very-well-be-true-but-im-not-at-all-convinced-by-the-analysis-being-used/\">usually misleading</a> for squishy things like medicine and social science.\r\n\r\n(He also thinks <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTellMeTheOdds\">Han Solo</a> is valid.) \r\n\r\nWhile I am bitter that my own early maths education was so mindless, I'm amazed and glad that a few kids out there get to learn from someone like this.",

    "review": "Imagine someone great - I think of Bertrand Russell or Dan Dennett or CS Peirce or Alan Turing - writing really well about actually scientific self-help. Imagine they wrote most days for 2 years, and so distilled decades of trying to find the truth as a heavily biased primate barely out of the trees. Imagine it was empathic <i>and</i> well-justified with argument and experimental data. But imagine it turns out it wasn't a Canonical figure writing it, but instead some guy on the internet with no credentials and weird opinions. But imagine - or rather, I ask you to trust me, til you see for yourself - that the result matches what the greats achieved in the theory of practical reasoning. (Dennett actually wrote <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18378002-intuition-pumps-and-other-tools-for-thinking\">a practical-reason how-to book</a>, and it isn't nearly as good.)\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>These essays are fumbling attempts to put into words lessons better taught by experience. But at least there’s underlying math, plus experimental evidence from cognitive psychology on how humans actually think. Maybe that will be enough to cross the stratospherically high threshold required for a discipline that lets you actually get it right, instead of just constraining you into interesting new mistakes.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThis is only one-sixth of Yudkowsky's enormous <i><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/sequences\">Sequences</a></i> - an unusually scientifically accurate philosophical system covering statistics, physics, psychology, history, ethics, and, most importantly, the specific universal obstacles to your being rational. (As a brutal compression, the philosophy can be glossed as radical Bayesian-Quinean evidentialism.) I've read it three times in 10 years, and got more from it each time. Quite a lot of it seemed absurd the first time I read it, for instance his principle of Conservation of Expected Evidence, but I now know it to be mathematically safe. \r\n\r\nThere are loads of great tools here. Just one example out of dozens: the idea of a pejorative Fully General Counterargument, a good-sounding objection which applies equally to all possible arguments, and which thus tells you nothing about the truth of the matter. Examples\r\n\r\n* “Oh he's an 'expert' is he? Experts are systematically <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11152.html\">miscalibrated</a>”\r\n* “My opponent is [just] a clever arguer”\r\n* “That evidence was filtered by a biased person, therefore I can ignore it”\r\n* \"There are arguments both for and against”\r\n\r\nAlong with Kant's <i>Transcendental Analytic</i>, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> (don't ask), and Marfarquhar's <i>Strangers Drowning</i>, it's one of the only books I've ever taken <a href=\"https://www.gleech.org/yud/\">paragraph-by-paragraph notes on</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/\">Free, or by donation to his nonprofit, here</a>.",

    "review": "Deeply uncanny - without worshipping mystery. (\"<a href=\"http://art.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/0066/borges.pdf\">Tlön</a>\" is scarier to me than anything in Lovecraft. \"<a href=\"http://libraryofbabel.info/Borges/libraryofbabel.pdf\">Babel</a>\" is also horrifying in its way.) Playing at the limits of reason - without renouncing objectivity. (There is something of the unearthly drama and transcendence of higher mathematics in a couple of these stories.) Somehow it manages to be cryptic without being annoying, to use literary gossip and the droning of archivists straight. Some of this is 80 years old, and it's still completely fresh.\r\n\r\nHe makes literature larger, by bringing new things into scope - bibliographic minutiae, English department arcana, salon gossip. There's something refreshing about his perfect fake book reviews. Gushing praise of nonexistent authors draws back the veil (as if our world's reviewers would say the same things whether or not the authors existed). \r\n\r\nBorges was not a postmodernist but these anyway have the best of what postmodernism is taken to mean: nonliteral play, generative scepticism about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference\">sense and reference</a> and language-games, reasoning about the limits of reason.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of the significance of some of Borges' sentences here. But for once the critic's working assumption of meaning seems sound: if I thought about it, I could find out. (And not just in the ordinary way, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia\">by projection</a>. I expect to find <i>Borges</i> in them if I try.)\r\n\r\nI've some ideas about each story, but none that fit completely or exhaust them. Here's one:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere's a banal idea: \"language is composite\". Characters go into words into sentences into works into worldviews. In \"The Library of Babel\", Borges stretches this fact until you see the horror in it, the <a href=\"http://www.singularitysymposium.com/exponential-growth.html\">shocking</a> vastness of exponentiation on the tiny scale of a human life. The simple idea of mechanically generating all strings of length <i>n=1,312,000</i> leads to an incredibly claustrophobic closed system. The story is not 8 pages long but contains more than most books.\r\n\r\nThere exists one truth; there are uncountably many falsehoods; but worse, there's a far larger infinity of nonsense, of things which make sense in no language, which don't make enough sense to be false, which never will. This is the horror of Platonism or Many-world physics or Meinong: that we could be invisibly boxed-in by garbled infinities, endless keyboard mashing. The \"noosphere\" - all the good ideas, all the bad ideas ever had - is a tiny pocket of meaning in a sea of meaninglessness.\r\n\r\nThe stunning effect of \"Babel\" depends on its not being magic, not hand-wavy (merely monstrous, physically impossible for interesting reasons which violate no particular law). Ted Chiang is grasping at a similar titanic scale when he uses a truly alien language <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/Story-Of-Your-Life\">to explain variational physics</a>.\r\n\r\nRemember that Borges was a librarian. But, while he said <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7572-i-have-always-imagined-that-paradise-will-be-a-kind\">photogenic things</a> about libraries, he didn't necessarily like being in them. \"The Library of Babel\" adds an extremely mordant overtone to that quotation, by imagining an otherworldly library which breaks men just by being there. Sturrock, his biographer:\r\n<blockquote><i>    Borges had some reason to dislike libraries because for nine years \"of solid unhappiness\", from 1937 to 1946, he was obliged to work in one, as a quite junior librarian, in order to make money. The cataloguing work he did was futile... </blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThe alphabet used for the Babel books has 22 letters and no uppercase. We could try and look up human languages with that many letters, but better to take this as a hint that our narrator is <i>not us</i> - he can be a total alien, far from Earth, and the exact same library will still confound him the exact same way. The same geometry constrains all minds. What looks like meaning need not be, if your sample is large enough:\r\n<blockquote><i>This useless and wordy epistle itself already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves in one of the uncountable heaxgons - and so does its refutation. (And <i>n</i> possible languages make use of the <i>same</i> vocabulary; in some of them the symbol 'library' admits of the correct definition 'ubiquitous and everlasting system of hexagonal galleries', but 'library' is 'bread' or 'pyramid' of anything else... You who read me, are you sure you understand my language?) \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe narrator says that the fall from his floor \"<i>is infinite</i>\" (or indefinite), that the rooms are \"<i>uncountable</i>\", but we can do better than this quite easily, given only the text. There are 410*40*80 = 1312000 characters per book. The number of distinct books is thus (22 + 3)^{1312000} or about 2 followed by about 1.8 million zeroes. It is hard to give a reference for how large this is: if every atom in the universe contained as many atoms as are in the universe (10^80), and each of the nested atoms was a Babel book, this would still contain only a laughably tiny fraction of Babel, less than one googolplexth. There's 4*5*32 = 640 books per hexagon, so we need about 3 x 10^1834094 room-sized hexagons. This is the full implication of the simple thought \"every book of length 1312000\".\r\n\r\nIt couldn't possibly be even fractionally built. And yet, through the power of maths, <a href=\"http://libraryofbabel.info/book.cgi?0-w1-s1-v17:1\">it has been built</a> - \"only implicitly, skeletally\", but it still counts.\r\n\r\n(Borges notes this infinity/finity conflict on the last page, explaining that the Library is unbounded and periodic, a hypersphere.)\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful, inspiring lesson to be taken from it actually: think about what the incredible feat of writing any book - no matter how bad - actually entails. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function\">Our nervous system</a> shields us from Babel, from the larger part of possible meanings and the overwhelming majority of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)\">string</a> space. This is an astonishing act, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MwQRucYo6BZZwjKE7/einstein-s-arrogance\">in information-theory terms</a>: the ultimate search, which we succeed at effortlessly, many times a day. Epic achievements in life-giving ignoring.",

I've seen people dismiss it as narrowly economic (\"people value more than money ya know\") but this is stupid: fully half the book is about morals and culture. There are dozens of lovely little easter eggs in Weinersmith's art too (e.g. \"Conspicuone Pecansumption\" icecream).\r\n\r\nThe arguments:\r\n\r\n1. Closed borders lead to incredible suffering - not just the obvious oppression of camps, raids, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/essex-lorry-deaths-tragic-political\">struggle</a> and drownings, but also the unnecessary perpetuation of poverty. \r\n\r\n2. He argues that it's a human rights issue: \"<i>If a foreigner wants to accept a job offer from a willing employer or rent an apartment from a willing landlord, what moral right does anyone have to stop them? These are contracts between consenting adults, not welfare programs.</i>\" The regulation is an apartheid with comparatively little outcry and great popularity.\r\n\r\n3. America had completely open borders until <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875\">1875</a> and comparatively-free undocumented immigration until <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924\">1924</a>. It did pretty alright.\r\n\r\n4. Immigrants on average have been fiscally net-positive. Doing our best to isolate the effects, moving to a rich country seems to multiply your productivity. (For a few reasons: more co-operation, a larger market for your work, no tropical disease, coastal trade, IQ gain if you're young.) <a href=\"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.25.3.83\">This model</a> predicts trillions of dollars of gain from open borders. If true, this massively reduces global poverty.\r\n\r\n5. Immigrants are on average culturally positive, allowing the recipient country to select from the best of everything in the world. The first generation are quite a bit more law-abiding than average natives. (Nowrasteh estimates that just <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/terrorism-immigration-risk-analysis\">one in seven million</a> immigrants turned out to be a terrorist.) Assimilation is high, usually complete within 2-3 generations. \"Political externalities\" (the idea that your good culture will be voted out by bad culture once you let immigrants vote) have not in fact been seen.\r\n\r\nResidual points:\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>The data is mostly from our current highly-restricted high-skill-only immigration regime. It's not clear which effects would change in the dramatically different world Caplan promotes, though he does his best to look at saturation effects and the low-skilled who are currently persecuted-out. (For instance, a large part of his cultural argument depends on the low-skilled continuing to not vote, as they haven't.)</li><br>\r\n <li>The biggest risk by far is the damage caused by irrational native backlash against foreigners. This produces things like Brexit and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobbik\">Jobbik</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Party_of_Austria\">Austrian 'Freedom'</a> governments. Chapter 6 addresses some of this by suggesting ways to make things unfair for the migrants (limiting their welfare access, entry tolls, language tests, slow naturalisation) to mollify the local problems / backlash and so protect people's right to move in the first place. I glumly suspect this wouldn't work, because much of the backlash isn't based on real effects, and so can't be mollified by policy. (Indeed, he notes that most of the suggested hobbles <i>already</i> exist in US law in some form, and might have somewhat dulled anti-immigration sentiment.)</li><br>\r\n<li>He sometimes implies that he'd open borders in one big bang - but this size of policy shift should basically never be done, just out of epistemic modesty and reversibility. His counter is that the magnitude of the gains is too large to be possibly less than zero.</li><br>\r\n<li>It's mostly based on US data and US policy is the target, which is completely fine but limits the inference. This is sensible; general theory, general policy usually fail.</li><br>\r\n<li>To my surprise he doesn't much emphasise the macropolitical benefits of immigration: if people could just leave countries with terrible policies, taking their taxes with them, this would be a new and powerful check on government abuse. Voting with your feet, and governments actually trying to attract and retain people. </li><br>\r\n\r\n<li>Though its evidence checks out (as far as I can tell), it's still a polemic (like <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> before it!). As such it's simple, too simple. The Center for Global Development has a sadder, equivocal <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/migration-what-you-make-it-seven-policy-decisions-turned-challenges-opportunities\">summary</a> congruent to the limits of social science:\r\n<blockquote><i>No case study or academic paper can—ever—spell out what “the” effect of “immigration” is. Asking this question has as little use as asking whether “taxes” are inherently “good” or “bad.” The answer depends on what is taxed and what the revenue is spent on. Those choices make the policy harmful or beneficial. The same is true of migration.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",

    "review": "    Less critical than I was expecting, still good. The trouble with evaluating leaders (this goes for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_investigator\">modern scientists</a> as much as corporate founders) is that they are able to take so much credit for the work of those they hire / train. Even so, Bezos had a lot of ideas - we know this because some failures are attributed to him, putting an upper bound at least on the file-drawer problem of Amazon's creativity. (Stone seems pretty good at tracking down the real inventors. And he literally dug through Bezos' garbage in search of details.) And he is a hyperactive micromanager, pulling conference call screens off the walls, ramming through his pet projects over any amount of opposition:\n<blockquote><i>Almost alone, Bezos believed fervently in Prime, closely tracking sign-ups each day and intervening every timr the retail group dropped its promotions from the home page.\n</blockquote></i>\n\nThe management style is/was macho, with an uneasy mix of flat objectivity (if you show the maths of your idea works, you are likely to get serious consideration) and imperial whim (like making everyone write meeting notes in full prose - which is based on no science in particular).\n<blockquote><i>Bezos treats workers like expendable resources without taking into account their contributions to the company. That in turn allows him to coldly allocate capital and manpower and make hyperrational business decisions where another executive might let personal relationships intrude. But they also acknowledge that Bezos is primarily consumed with improving the company's performance and customer service...\n</blockquote></i>\n\n    Some of Stone's anecdotes about this or that mid-level exec are neither funny nor illustrative, and make this feel like a reference text. I suppose there should be one.\n\nWith them so dominant now, it's easy to forget the stock crashing to $10, or Amazon being seriously threatened by a single Lehman analyst, or all the many failures like Auctions or zShops or A9.com. And that they really were another garage operation that took over the world.\n\nStone does push back a bit - the \"two-pizza team\" idea gets uncritically celebrated in business, but Stone says that the actual teams hate it. I'm fascinated by Bezos making each team come up with their own <a href=\"http://www.andreweifler.com/fitness-functions/\">objective function</a> - but apparently this is also hated, on \"digging our own grave\" grounds. (Isn't any quantified performance metric hated?)\n\nThen there's the context switch that makes the billions seem small: since he was a child, Bezos seems to honestly see himself as shepherding humanity into space, with Amazon a means to that end.\n\nNot enough coverage of just how weird Amazon is, in terms of shareholder quiescence, the astonishing amount of cheap capital it hoovers up, its terrible reputation among 90s and 00s analyst as a \"nonprofit scam\". It was <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/AMZN/profit_margin\">almost never profitable</a> for 20 straight years, but people kept throwing money into the bubble... which has stopped being a bubble (because of AWS, not really retail). The tiny tax burden that people decry should start growing, and antitrust attention too.\n\nNo attention to what we should expect of Amazon's effect on literature and ideas, given the mass die-off of local bookshops <i>and</i> the weakening of gatekeeper publishers. (I don't know what the effect is either, but if I wrote a book about them I hope I would have a go.)\n\nSkimmed a bit, e.g. 2004, the Zappos chapter, ",

    "review": "Economics bills itself as 'the study of decisions under scarcity', though much of it is actually about excess: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_goods\">luxury</a> substitution, savings rates, futures markets, conspicuous consumption, and so on. The psychological side - the panic, narrow focus, and sense of doom - was completely absent from my economics classes, but without it you can't really understand poverty, and thus can't value economic growth as the life-saving, mind-saving thing it has been. \r\n\r\nReasons scarcity is bad:\r\n1. Lower consumption is less good (and sometimes very bad)\r\n2. Less freedom (fewer choices)\r\n3. Anxiety (emotional penalty)\r\n4. Cognitive penalty (bandwidth of worrying)\r\n5. Excessive focus on present, no planning, compromising future (\"tunnelling\")\r\n6. Have to spend time on careful allocation (\"juggling\")\r\n7. Excess self-consciousness means worse performance (\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choke_(sports)\">choking</a>\")\r\n8. It might also poison social interaction by <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bfriedman/files/the_moral_consequences_of_economic_growth_0.pdf\">encouraging</a> <a href=\"http://www.nonzero.org/app1.htm\">zero-sum thinking</a> and its attendent wasteful conflict. (Although see <a href=\"http://www.sebastianjunger.com/tribe-by-sebastian-junger\">Junger</a> for some positive social effects of shared adversity.)\r\n9. It recurses: Mistakes lead to real sacrifice (debt; traps; no slack means penalties bite, further reducing slack). Scarcity causes more scarcity by screwing with your planning and implementation skills.\r\n\r\nEconomics only really handles costs (1) and (2). Psychology at its best handles (3-7). (9) is the author's new contribution, I think: this is cognitive economics.\r\n\r\n    Without <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/\">some spare resources</a> it's impossible to be free, to be generous, to relax. That's obvious. Less obvious: Without slack you can't even think straight (there's a \"bandwidth tax\" on the poor, reducing their effective intelligence, willpower by perhaps an entire standard deviation). Most of the cited experiments are about money scarcity, but their ingenious move is to generalise to all of us, to all conditions where a person lacks some instinctively (evolutionarily) key resource: e.g. money, time, calories, friends. As well as a rare theoretical synthesis, this makes this book more evocative for its rich-world readers:\r\n<blockquote><i>We have used the psychology of scarcity to create an empathy bridge. We have used experience with one form of scarcity (say, time) to connect to another form (money). Having known what it’s like to badly need a little more time, we might start to imagine what it’s like to desperately need a little more money or even more friends. We used this bridge to draw a connection between a busy manager fretting about insufficient time before a deadline and a person short on cash fretting about insufficient funds to pay rent.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nExciting! I've been reading development economics and behavioural science for years, and I still got a lot of new results and a whole gosh-darnit Practical Theory of Mind with moving parts from this. \r\n\r\nThey compress all the complex constructs and determinants of their real theory into a lossy construct, \"bandwidth\". This is a shorthand for working memory <i>&</i> fluid intelligence <i>&</i> attention span <i>&</i> decision consistency <i>&</i> persistence <i>&</i> executive control <i>&</i> long-term planning inclination. They admit at the start it's a compression, so that's fine.\r\n<blockquote><i>With compromised bandwidth, we are more likely to give in to our impulses, more likely to cave in to temptations. With little slack, we have less room to fail. With compromised bandwidth, we are more likely to fail.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nLesson: To actually optimise your life, you can't optimise too hard, in the sense of pushing right up against your budgets. This idea is not new; a different book would tie this to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little's_law\">queuing theory</a> and distributed systems, trying to find general theoretical truths about systems. (What's the maximum sustainable load for a server? For a life?) Excess capacity, 'slack', is short-run inefficiency <i>and</i> long-term shock-tolerance and thus <a href=\"https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00229?gko=a073f\">true efficiency</a>. The point seems to apply to servers, hospitals, and a single human life viewed from inside.\r\n\r\nThis also adds to Taleb's critique of naive finance, encouraging 'risk-sensitive optimisation' (or, death-sensitive).  Extends bounded rationality to limited attention, willpower, as well as computation and a search budget.\r\n\r\nThe book's big philosophical question is the old Essence vs Context chestnut (\"the poor are worse parents, drivers, borrowers\" vs \"given these constraints, people are worse parents, drivers, borrowers\"). But it's a new twist on it: rather than (as well as) a developmental deficiency, poverty is an active, situational force: \r\n<blockquote><i>This shortfall is not of the standard physiological variety, having to do with a lack of nutrition or stress from early childhood hindering brain development. Nor is bandwidth permanently compromised by poverty. It is the present-day cognitive load of making ends meet: when income rises, so, too, does cognitive capacity. The bandwidth of the farmers was restored as soon as crop payments were received. Poverty at its very core taxes bandwidth and diminishes capacity.</blockquote></i>\r\nThis surprises me: I generally accept that people are <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/docs/sociology/1987-rossi\">hard to change</a>, that engineered context is relatively weak. But then all attempts at self-improvement are a denial of essentialism about <i>something</i>, and I'm well into those.\r\n<blockquote><i>To explain why the poor borrow excessively, we do not need to appeal to a lack of financial education, the avarice of predatory lenders, or an oversized tendency for self-indulgence. To explain why the busy put off things and fall behind, we do not need to appeal to weak self-control, deficient understanding, or a lack of time-management skills. Instead, borrowing is a simple consequence of tunneling.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThey don't sugarcoat it: they accept the massive body of evidence on how burdened the poor are, on dozens of axes. And they note that just giving them cash rarely solves the problem because this doesn't change the logic enough.\r\n<blockquote><i>The poor stay poor, the lonely stay lonely, the busy stay busy, and diets fail.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nOne big gripe: They use the word \"scarcity\" for both a physical shortage (i.e. the normal economic sense) and for this special psychological burden. (Not having, and having your mind captured by not having.) This needs two words; it muddies their thesis.\r\n\r\nThey've persuaded me that late fines are an extremely regressive tax. I'm open to the view that reducing poor people's options is sometimes best for them (e.g. if they are \"<i>hurt by the ability to borrow</i> [at extortionate rates]\" because it prevents them smoothing their income in a credit cycle). I agree that bandwidth is the deepest kind of human capital. \r\n\r\nTheir treatment of the mental costs of education is important, given NGOs' blithe promotion of education over all else. (And it's a further argument for unconditional cash transfers.) \r\n<blockquote><i>To capitalize on a bonus payment for a child’s medical checkup, a parent must set up the appointment, remember to keep it, find the time to get there and back, and coerce the child to go (no child likes the doctor!). Each of these steps requires some bandwidth. And this is just one behavior. Conditional cash transfer programs seek to encourage dozens, if not hundreds, of these good behaviors. Just understanding those incentives and making the necessary trade-offs—deciding which are worth it for you and which are not, and when—requires bandwidth.\r\n\r\nWe never ask, Is this how we want poor people to use their bandwidth? We never factor in this cost in deciding which behaviors are most worth promoting. When we design poverty programs, we recognize that the poor are short on cash, so we are careful to conserve on that. But we do not think of bandwidth as being scarce as well. Nowhere is this clearer than in our impulse to educate.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n    \r\nI'm a keen and cynical student of social research, and but I only recognised one spurious result in this whole book. (ego depletion, p.107 - and that only in a tangent explicitly phrased as hypothetical.)  They did a pretty convincing within-subjects study on sugar farmers before and after harvest income which nails down the effect as far as I can see.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOnly not five stars because we can't give any social science book five stars until it is 20 years old and more severely scrutinised.",

I fit three out four of its demographics (Doric speakers, Aberdeen students, de novo idealist, but not a woman), but this still didn't leave much impact.

    "review": "Elementary philosophy of science focussing on Wheeler's \"<a href=\"http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/3138/1/Really%20Big%20Questions.pdf\">Really Big Questions</a>\" about the foundations of physics, in particular the 'digital physics'. (The Questions are ‘<i>How come existence</i>?’, ‘<i>Why the quantum</i>?’, ‘<i>It from bit?</i>’, ‘<i>What makes meaning?</i>’) \r\n\r\nWhich wasn't what I was expecting from an out-of-print hardback tome by a serious physicist - particularly with that grand title - but still: nice. In fact it's hard to imagine anyone writing out these first steps any friendlier (ok, maybe <a href=\"https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/\">Ben Orlin</a>). Its technical work feels effortless; think Schroedinger's <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life%3F\">What is Life?</a></i> (which von Baeyer actually corrects, in passing).\r\n\r\nI needed a book on the method / meta-field surrounding mathematical \"information\", because it has surrounded me: it threatens to encompass science. Just as \"energy\" eventually became a unifying pillar of all the natural sciences, information has infiltrated that same salient: \r\n\r\nEnergy <-> Entropy <-> Information. \r\n\r\nAnd then into other sciences: vB hints that we should see bits as money as ML-performance as Fisher information as VNM utility, which would seize about half of theoretical science.\r\n\r\nInfo theory is a core part of a mathematico-philosophical witch's brew: computability, decision theory, <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf\">computational complexity</a>, <a href=\"http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/GaussianModel/JaynesProbabilityTheory.pdf\">Bayesian statistics</a>, digital physics, quantum computing. Which together take big steps towards the naturalisation of logic - or, more, of maths - or more, of thought. (And is information larger than thought?) And/or the dematerialisation of physics?\r\n\r\nvon Baeyer builds it all up, so we get Clausius (1852) for thermodynamics, Boltzmann (1877) for entropy (inverse info) as a proper physical object, Shannon (1930) for classical info theory, Solomonoff (1960) for algorithmic complexity, Landauer for the shocking physics of computation (1961), Bekenstein (1971) and Hawking for black hole theory (crucial experiments for it-from-bit), Deutsch (1985) for how quantum computing could work. And Wheeler setting the whole new agenda. (I call it new because it hasn't made it into undergraduate philosophy, or physics, or statistics, or ordinary computer science, yet.)\r\n\r\nThe philosophy is very well done. I really liked his physicist's optimism about reflective equilibrium between science and folk physics:\r\n<blockquote><i>Information, too, has been defined operationally. Unfortunately, this technical, bottom-up definition is very restricted, and hitherto bears little resemblence to any of the common, top-down definitions. Eventually the two definitions should converge, but that hasn't happened yet. When it does, we will finally know what information is. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nIt impresses me to find a pop science book that has aged this well, over 16 years. It's sad that that's impressive - obviously I'm not reading enough physics and maths. Von Baeyer maybe leans too hard on the physics-is-solid heuristic; he ends up being uncritical about some extremely late-breaking and radical work: the heterodox classical theory of <a href=\"http://www.matheory.info/chapter1.html\">Kahre</a> (2002) and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1018820410908\">Zeilinger's</a> (1999) grand quietist explanation for QM's weirdness (neither of which I've heard much about since). \r\n<blockquote><i>Zeilinger's principle... furnishes an answer to Wheeler's famous question \"Why the quantum?\" Why does nature seems granular, discontinuous, quantized into discrete chunks like sand..? The answer is that while we have no idea how the world is really arranged, and shouldn't even ask, we </i>do<i> know that knowledge of the world is information: and since information is naturally quantized into bits, the world also appears quantized. If it didn't, we wouldn't be able to understand it. It's both as simple and as profound as that.\r\n\r\nA second prediction of QM that is explained... is the randomness of the outcomes of some measurements... if the single bit of information in an elementary system is revealed, then there is no more information left over to answer additional experimental questions... so other independent measurements must have random answers.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nEach chapter takes an idea (\"heat and entropy\", \"logarithms and message space\", \"qubits\", \"Morse and optimality\") and builds it up with little informal proofs and thought experiments. This is nice, but because it has to do everything from scratch it's more of a grab-bag than an argument, and certainly not a \"language of science\" by the end. For instance, he stops short of one key philosophical outcome of all this technical talk, which is that there are two types of explanations, even though he covers all the ideas you'd need:\r\n\r\n1) information compressions (e.g. General relativity explains the force on <i>all</i> of the infinite points in spacetime in one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations#Mathematical_form\">unbelievably terse tensor equation</a>. We can often count the bits used by theories like this, and so solve theory selection!)\r\n\r\n2) simplified algorithms, faster ways to reason about the world (e.g. much of computer science)\r\n\r\nAs you can tell from the number of question marks in this review, I found this stimulating but not conclusive. But it would be foolish to expect a pop book to answer the Really Big Questions, and von Baeyer's reminds us frequently that the current answers he presents are unfinished. So this is step one of a currently unbounded algorithm. Minus a half for not quite taking things as far as they can go.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<i>Misc notes</i>\r\n\r\n* This would be a pretty good primer for <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality\">Map and Territory</a> or <a href=\"\">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a>, if those assume too much for you.\r\n\r\n* <i>Lots</i> of literary illustrations of scientific ideas - Calvino, Wittgenstein, Borges - but it didn't feel forced to me. I suppose it might actually reduce the friendliness, for some readers.\r\n\r\n* Is this true?:\r\n<blockquote><i>The most important role of noise, however, is as the preserver of our sanity. Without noise, the measurement or observation of a single quantity would requite an infinite memory and an infinite amount of time - it would overload all our circuits. Neither science nor consciousness could exist... noise is a thick blanket of snow which softens the contours into large, rounded mounds we can perceive and sort out without being overwhelmed.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nWe evolved <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Gigerenzer#Heuristics\">lots of ways</a> to ignore information. Why would this not happen again? A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye#Early_eyes\">photosensitive patch</a> arises in that noiseless world; since it is an analogue processor it simply trims off the infinite information by default when it runs out of molecules or reactions(?)\r\n\r\n* He calls the Bayesian interpretation of probability \"the rational approach\" which suits me but let's imagine that's a mistranslation of his meaning \"the mental approach\", \"the personalist approach\".\r\n\r\n\r\n* Gleick handles the social history and applications with unsurpassed skill, but I wanted the mind-bending crunchy side, <i>natural information</i>, digital physics, information as everything.\r\n\r\n* \"Information is flow of form\"\r\n\r\n* <a href=\"https://bethzero.com/2019/07/09/12-why-kolmogorov-complexity-is-useless/\">Solomonoff induction is intractable</a>, another word for practically useless. Does this change the philosophical significance of the above brew? I don't think so - \"Here is a way to work everything out; you can almost never use it\" is a pretty plausible way for philosophy to end tbf. Does it change its scientific significance? Yes, absolutely - we have to seek approximations of the forbidden ideal or else it has none.\r\n\r\n* What's fundamental, thermodynamics or information? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics\">Neither</a>?\r\n\r\n* Yet another way that info theory eats the life of the mind is the deeply practical \"value of information\", a way of deciding whether to bother with an experiment (q.v. the master, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xiojTDJP6FWdb2Fmb/value-of-information-8-examples\">Gwern</a>).",

    "review": "<blockquote><i>some social science students who have read Kuhn’s work on ‘paradigm shifts’ in the history of natural science (science students have normally not heard of him) say rather indignantly: ‘Oh, do you mean a PhD has to be just doing normal science?’ And indeed we do mean that... It is the basic useful activity of scientists and scholars, and PhD students should be pleased to make a contribution to it. You can leave the paradigm shifts for after your PhD...\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nLiked it - it has a quiet rigour and schoolmistressy focus I wasn't expecting - but my god you have to skim. Many sentences could lose two-thirds of the words without losing any meaning; probably no-one exists for whom every chapter is relevant. But they make skimming easy by listing recommended actions in a box at the start of each chapter.\r\n\r\nThere's a thoughtful chapter on psychological mechanisms to watch out for. \r\n( e.g. Enthusiasm -> overambition -> failure -> frustration -> no energy; \r\nSpecialisation -> isolation -> no stimulation -> no energy; \r\nLearning -> independence -> shorter cycles -> faster learning -> fuzzies and progress.\r\nBoredom -> Boredom -> Boredom. ) \r\nThe many quotations from current PhD students are nice, showing the range of characters and concomitant problems you face, allowing you to tailor the advice a bit.\r\n\r\nThey confess that any general book on the matter is necessarily incomplete, since each field has its own defining skills, styles, and norms, often unwritten or badly written.\r\n\r\nCall the reigning institutionalised, credentialist way of allocating epistemic value <i>schoolism</i>. This book is a particularly blithe example\r\n<blockquote><i>It is only by understanding the need for precision and having the ability to apply yourself in a disciplined way that you will eventually get to the point where you have the right to follow up interesting leads and explore a series of ideas that arise out of the work in hand. We suggest that, for the moment, this should be after your doctorate.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n(To be fair they also instruct you to think for yourself, to manage your supervisor, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe \"non-traditional students\" chapter is interesting, if only for the separate sections for male and female students which have almost the same advice. (\"<i>1. Join or establish a [gender]’ peer support group. 2. Discuss with your supervisors any problems in the male/female aspect of the student–supervisor relationship...</i>\") Neat but kind of disingenuous.\r\n\r\nQuestions and answers I (loosely) got from this:\r\n\r\n* <i>What needs to be done?</i> -> It's your first job to find out \r\n* <i>What do I need to know to do it?</i> -> field-specific; watch and learn.\r\n* <i>What are the standards?</i> -> Read theses. List the craft practices of a good researcher.\r\n* <i>Who should my advisor be?</i> -> Kind, active researcher, interested in your thing, low flight risk\r\n* <i>What counts as original enough?</i> -> Read theses to find out, take the delta\r\n* <i>What counts as large enough?</i> -> \"an increment\"\r\n* <i>How do I not get scooped?</i> -> Don't worry about it. The important thing is to notice you have been.\r\n* <i>How do I not freeze up on seeing the fractal connectedness of all things?</i> -> notice it, make a note, then return to your breath.\r\n* <i>What about my mental health?</i> -> Exercise, take breaks and talk to fellow experts\r\n* <i>How do I not feel isolated?</i> -> communicate more and better. Stay excited, people like it.\r\n* <i>What if I fuck up?</i> -> Practice and get feedback! use no technique for the first time in your thesis. Do throwaways, etudes.\r\n* <i>Why should they listen to you?</i> -> because you've nailed everything down and added a cherry",

    "review": "Deeply conventional mind candy - it may be the skewed mores of the Cthulhu Mythos post-Whedon, but those are pretty conformist these days. Though the right reference class for this series is Robert Rankin, not Lovecraft. Lots of clumsy geek references (re: trains, smartphone fetishes, programming concepts), and lots of clumsy US-centric edits (\"taking the DLR to Canary Wharf in the east of London\" said no Londoner ever). I wonder if this is just because he writes so fast these days (~2 books a year).\n \n    His great strength remains the tawdriness of office life (which he manages to accurately display despite also displaying ancient tentacular spectacles).     e.g. a nice touch here: the office audit of paperclip usage - previously a joke about pedantry and bureaucracy gone wild - is revealed to have a deadly serious rationale.\n\nOne surprising grey area in the plot: <spoiler>the Laundry produces some fake research to draw out the cultists. It says that the apocalypse will spread exponentially fast, and is inevitable. But the cult leader is relatively rational, trying to make humanity survive, and so this false catastrophe actually pushes them over the edge. Epistemic poisoning.</spoiler>\n\n    I continue to have mixed feelings about Stross, but hey I continue to read him. (Book #1, <i>Atrocity Archives</i> works best because it subverts James Bond more, and the Nazi villains are fun, and the gag hasn't worn thin.)",

It sufficed!\n\nObviously it's not good for your only exposure to history to be the 100 most dramatic moments, the 100 most elite and unrepresentative people. (For each page of a regular history book I should <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TLKPj4GDXetZuPDH5/making-history-available\">imagine the lives of a thousand peasants</a>.) But very few people have any grasp of history beyond this superficial roll call, so it didn't hurt me much to delay it.\n\nOur need for \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_history\">people's history</a>\" is great: it at least has a chance of being an accurate picture of the past. (Many <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/december/wineburg-historiography-zinn-122012.html\">particular instances</a> of people's history are fatally false or misleading though, because the contrarianism and ideological heat of the topic draws parasites and shills.) \n        ",

    "review": "To my surprise I recommend this for anyone. (The chapters are tiny and I did the whole thing in an hour.) For outsiders it's an honest and nontechnical portrait of a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/\">new, strange, and wonderful endeavour</a>; and Chivers shows his path from ordinary sceptical thoughtfulness to taking the idea seriously. (However, there's almost no maths in it, and without maths you can only ever sort-of get the gist. For instance, one of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEUO6pjwFOo\">key premises</a> of the whole programme is very easy to understand if you've ever seen the structure of a reinforcement learning algorithm - where the 'optimizer' and the 'reward function' are completely separate modules varying freely - and apparently quite difficult to accept if you haven't.)\r\n\r\n        For insiders it's a reminder of just how strange the project seems from outside. The chasm of inferential distance. There's also fun new details: I had no idea that Bostrom is name-dropped in Donald Glover's <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/donald-glover-cant-save-you/amp\">new TV show</a>, for instance. And this made me laugh: \r\n<blockquote><i><a href=\"http://shlegeris.com/posts\">Buck Shlegeris</a>, a young MIRI employee with excitingly coloured hair and an Australian accent, told me that 'A book on this topic could be good', and that 'if I could jump into your body I have high confidence I could write it'. However, his confidence that </i>I<i> could write it from within my own body seemed significantly lower, which is probably fair enough.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nIf you've read much on the topic you can skip the whole middle third of the book, it's just Chivers paraphrasing bits of the first two <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/sequences\">Sequences</a>.\r\n\r\n        Chivers overemphasises Yudkowsky. <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/\">Gwern</a>, <a href=\"https://meteuphoric.com/\">Grace</a>, <a href=\"http://aleph.se/andart2/space/what-kinds-of-grand-futures-are-there/\">Sandberg</a>, and <a href=\"http://lukemuehlhauser.com/three-wild-speculations-from-amateur-quantitative-macrohistory/\">Muehlhauser</a> get one passing reference each, but their work (and <a href=\"https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/\">Krakovna</a>'s) have each had a larger effect on me, and on others I know. Not to mention the <a href=\"https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/04/14/useful-notes-on-tumblr-rationalist-culture/\">tumblrs</a>. Ach never mind: it's a huge illegible mess of a movement and he's done well.\r\n\r\n    Some of the interviewees make patently poor arguments - <a href=\"https://www.excvbitor.com/authors/andrew-sabisky\">Sabisky</a> (\"<i>it's a sex cult</i>\"), <a href=\"https://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/index.html\">Brooks</a> (\"<i>no</i> [AI safety proponents] <i>have ever done any work in AI itself</i>\"), <a href=\"https://davidgerard.co.uk/other.html\">Gerard</a> (\"<i>it's a money-spinning cult</i>\") but it's <i>so</i> patent that I think people will see their prejudices. The real shame is that better critics exist - I have in mind the anonymous prosaic-AI researchers <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13933106.nostalgebraist\">Nostalgebraist</a> (\"alignment is equivalent to solving ethics and decision theory at once\") and \"<a href=\"https://bethzero.com/2019/04/11/7-links-2-ai-safety-critical-reading-list/\">Beth Zero</a>\". But I suppose anon randos are not the best subjects for a mass-market book.\r\n\r\n(<a href=\"https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/183180108244/an-ai-risk-effortpost\">Robnost</a>:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Here is what this ends up looking like: a quest to solve, once and for all, some of the most basic problems of existing and acting among others who are doing the same... problems of this sort have been wrestled with for a long time using terms like “coordination problems” and “Goodhart’s Law”; they constitute much of the subject matter of political philosophy, economics, and game theory, among other fields. It sounds misleadingly provincial to call such a quest “AI Alignment” ...\r\n\r\n        There is no doubt something beautiful – and much raw intellectual appeal – in the quest for Alignment.  It includes, of necessity, some of the most mind-bending facets of both mathematics and philosophy, and what is more, it has an emotional poignancy and human resonance rarely so close to the surface in those rarefied subjects.  I certainly have no quarrel with the choice to devote some resources, the life’s work of some people, to this grand Problem of Problems.  One imagines an Alignment monastery, carrying on the work for centuries.  I am not sure I would expect them to ever succeed, much less to succeed in some specified timeframe, but in some way it would make me glad, even proud, to know they were there.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n)\r\n\r\n    Young Yudkowsky is adorable - and I hope others are able to see this past his hubris and proclamations.\r\n\r\nChivers manages to show the power and emotional impact of the '<a href=\"https://www.rationality.org/resources/updates/2016/double-crux\">internal double crux</a>' idea:\r\n<blockquote><i>        I can picture a world in 50 or 100 that my children live in, which has different coastlines and higher risk of storms and, if I'm brually honest about it, famines in parts of the world I don't go. I could imagine my Western children in their Western world living lives not vastly different to mine, in which most of the suffering of the world is hidden away, and the lives of well-off Westerners continue and my kids have jobs... Whereas if the AI stuff really does happen, that's not the future they have... I can understand Bostrom's arguments that an intelligence explosion would completely transform the world; it's pointless speculating what a superintelligence would do, in the same way it would be stupid for a gorilla to wonder how humanity would change the world.\r\n\r\nAnd I realised that this was what the instinctive 'yuck' was when I thought about the arguments for AI risk. 'I feel that parents should be able to advise their children,' I said. 'Anything involving AGI happening in their lifetime - I can't advise them on that future. I can't tell them how best to live their lives because I don't know what their lives will look like, or even if they'll be recognisable as human lives... I'm scared for my children.' And at this point I apologised, because I found that I was crying.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n(Amateur psychoanalysis is fine - if you're doing it to yourself, and if you don't take it too seriously.)\r\n        \r\n    I'm pretty sure I know who this is (that mix of iron scrupulousness and radical honesty) and before I read it I thought the same: \r\n<blockquote><i>I met a senior Rationalist briefly in California, and he was extremely wary of me; he refused to go on the record. He has a reputation for being one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet, but I found him a bit stand-offish, at least at first. And I think that was because he knew I was writing this book. He said he was worried that if too many people hear about AI risk, then it'll end up like IQ, the subject of endless angry political arguments that have little to do with the science, and that a gaggle of nerdy Californian white guys probably weren't the best advocates for it then.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n    Journalistic harm I feared, that didn't come to pass: he never comments on anyone's appearance (\"<i>It would be extremely easy for me to write a book mocking them. But I don't want to do that.</i>\"); he mentions Dylan Matthews' irritating amateur psychoanalysis only once - roughly, \"<i>of course Silicon Valley people think that good software will save the world</i>\"; he gives exactly no time to that one proudly cruel subreddit devoted entirely to ad hominem idiocy about the Rats. He brings up polyamory a lot but not malignantly.\r\n \r\n        The \"<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/16/cardiologists-and-chinese-robbers/\">Chinese robber fallacy</a>\" is that you can make any large group seem evil by selecting from bad actors among them, even if they have exactly the same rate of the selected bad behaviour. If there are ~1m views on LessWrong per month, say 100,000 unique visitors. If sociopathy is found in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4649950/\">1%</a> of the general population then the site will have 1000 sociopathic visitors. If <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)\">99%</a> of visitors are lurkers, never commenting then you should expect 10 sociopathic commenters a month. This is enough to satisfy me that the 'dark side' (i.e. the odd far-rightist, and two gendered tragedies) Chivers covers is the selfsame dark side as our dumb world at large.\r\n\r\n    I hate Chivers capitalising \"Rationalist\" all the time. I double hate it when he pairs this with capitalised 'Effective Altruist', like \"<i>the Rationalist Effective Altruist Buck Shlegeris</i>\". At no point does Chivers use the full (and only appropriate) name for the identity: \"<i>aspiring</i> rationalist\". (No human is that rational.) But to be fair nor do most people online. \r\n\r\n    Couple of harmless errors (<a href=\"http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-231-helen-toner-on-misconceptions-about-china-and-artific.html\">Helen Toner</a> wasn't 'doing' ML in China, for instance). But the big one is that, after talking to all these people for and against, Chivers <i>ends</i> with the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svoD5KLKHyAKEdwPo/against-modest-epistemology\">deferential</a> prior: <a href=\"https://cdn.80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-02-17-at-6.53.52-pm.png\">80% of</a> technical researchers think it's 90% likely we'll have AGI within a century, and if (as Chivers thinks) 17% think it will be highly negative, then our best guess is a 14% chance of catastrophic AGI. (With <i>very</i> large error bars - but that's even worse when you think about it.) Now, since he began at extreme scepticism (<1%) this is a large update - and we were lucky that a journalist came this far out on the limb. But the arguments presented here for and against the Risk are not equally convincing. He is presumably just too modest to multiply them out, as an amateur, in the face of big expert surveys. But, see what you think.",

Neuroatypical, ascetic, principled, focussed to the point of dissociation. He slept on the floor for months, despite being rich, because he didn't see the need for comfort.

If you've never been on Xbox Live, you probably haven't had a 9 year-old child scream that you're a faggot and a noob. The child is channeling Romero.\r\n\r\nI concede that there would have been no Doom Moment without Romero's hyping it - that together these two men form one functioning human being.\r\n\r\n    Kushner occasionally adds value, e.g. when he notes that id were to gaming what technical metal was to music: the marriage of virtuosity with extreme content, \"<i>high technology and gruesome gameplay</i>\". To see how important skill is in selling a dark aesthetic, compare the Learjet-level success of fancy metal with the parochial subsistence of hardcore punk. \r\n\r\nHe also sees an entire type very clearly: the alpha nerd, with all his lofty contempt, Ferraris, workaholism, disloyalty, pranks, energy.

The second answer would be, 'Yes, there is an answer but unfortunately your brain isn't sufficiently developed yet to know the answer.' And Jesus could give a third answer: 'The Father, the Holy Ghost, and I have been thinking about that long before creation, but we haven't yet come to a conclusion.'</i></blockquote>\r\nA life of a saint. Not in the sense of a moral paragon - though he was very kind when he wasn't being stubborn - but in the sense of a man devoted to, possessed by one thing, a high and rare thing that sets him some way beyond society. No money, no fixed abode, no lovers, no children, no religion. 80% of his family eaten by Nazi Germany. And yet <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_things_named_after_Paul_Erd%C5%91s\">a glorious, constructive</a>, hilarious life. A champion moocher, eternal couchsurfer, generous and ascetic, witty and worldly. We are lucky to have had him.\r\n<blockquote><i>I [Hoffman] slept where he slept and stayed up nineteen hours a day, watching him prove and conjecture. I felt silly not being able, at the age of thirty, to keep up with a sickly looking seventy-three-year-old man. I suppose I could have shared his pills, but the only stimulant I took was caffeine.</i></blockquote>\r\n<i><blockquote>He abhorred discussions of sex as much as he disliked the act itself... In the late 1940s, during the Chinese civil war, Erdős took part in a food drive for the Communist Chinese. \"I remember walking into a big room in Los Angeles, at UCLA, I think,\" said Vazsonyi, \"and there was Erdős and all these people making packages of food. Some mischief-makers who knew of his disgust at naked women offered to make a $100 donation if he'd go with them to a burlesque show.\" To their astonishment, he immediately took them up on the offer. Afterwards, when they forked over the $100, he revealed the secret of his victory: \"See! I tricked you, you trivial beings! I took off my glasses and did not see a thing!\"</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nUnlike <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2664633920\">Perelman</a>, the other late-C20th-century mathematical saint, Erdős had a wicked sense of fun and style. Like him, Erdős let himself be completely dependent on others for housing and logistics, and demanded much of them.\r\n<blockquote><i>he expected his hosts to lodge him, feed him, and do his laundry, along with anything else he needed, as well as arrange for him to get to his next destination.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>Erdos started developing his private language... referring to Communists as people \"on the long wave-length,\" because in the electromagnetic spectrum the red waves were long. He said that Horthy supporters and other Fascist sympathizers were \"on the short wavelength.\" That's also when he started calling children and other small things \"epsilons,\" grandchildren \"epsilons squared,\" alcohol \"poison,\" music \"noise,\" and women \"bosses,\" an inversion of what Hungarian women often called their husbands. \"Give me an epsilon of poison,\" Erdos would say when he wanted a sip of wine. \"Wine, women, and song\" became \"Poison, bosses, and noise.\"\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>He then had a huge argument with the surgeon about why, since only one eye was being deadened [during his cornea transplant], he couldn't read a mathematics journal with the other, good eye. The surgeon made a series of frantic calls to the Memphis math department. \"Can you send a mathematician over here at once so that Erdos can talk math during surgery?\" The department obliged, and the operation went smoothly.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately only half of this is anecdotes about Erdős, the rest being the usual potted-history of quirky mathematicians (Archimedes the oblivious, Fermat the executioner, Gauss the crabbed, Hardy the dry eccentric, Ramanujan the sublime, Wiles the Stakhanovite) with the usual stories.  I skimmed these bits to get more of the good stuff.",

The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamiliarization\">defamiliarisation</a>, the perceptual aid in these is the equal of great philosophical work.\n\nThe best bit is his patience and magnanimity with folk psychology. He is <i>much</i> more empathetic with bad philosophy that I am; he builds people very different from himself or me (a worried father writing a moral-panic piece about perfect recall; a young-earth creationist tipped into despair by being god's practice shot), and then around page 10 he flips their philosophy, showing how it unravels in the face of reality, and so makes me look like an idiot zealot for being irritated by them.\n<blockquote><i>many people became convinced that </i>[alt-timeline creation devices]<i> nullified the moral weight of their actions. Few acted so rashly as to commit murder or other felonies, but...\n</blockquote></i>\nIn \"What's Expected of Us\" he has \"<i>one-third</i>\" of people <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb\">driven mad</a> by an intuitive demonstration of their lack of '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism_(metaphysics)\">libertarian</a>' free will. I don't doubt that <i>some</i> would be, but there's no way that one-third of people are that abstract, that philosophically susceptible. The world would look so different if they were. (We have \"paradox-absorbing crumple zones\", as Futurama puts it.) And as for the ones who did go mad, I would be tutting at them for letting bad philosophy confuse them to death.\n\nThe title story is just perfect, the story of a robot dissecting itself and thereby learning of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and its emotional implications. <spoiler>It's powerful because it's us. Our waste air is waste heat. Our pressure gradient is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_gradient#Biological_context\">proton gradient</a>. </spoiler>\n\nAnother distinctive thing: Half the stories have a pair of contrasting narrators, objective and subjective. One of these voices is merely expository, apparently styleless. But it just works.\n\n            I was primed to dislike \"The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling\" from the title alone: despite popular usage, feelings are neither true or false, but instead grounded or ungrounded, helpful or unhelpful. (I was shocked to find <a href=\"https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/04/10/in-my-culture/\">this activist taxonomy</a> very useful: valid / justified / effective.) But again it's larger than me: it links the great <a href=\"http://dss-edit.com/prof-anon/sound/library/Ong_orality_and_literacy.pdf\">oral-to-literate transition</a> to a near-future one from analogue-literate to digital-literate. God it's good, like <i>Black Mirror</i>  if it wasn't relentlessly scaremongering and cheap.\n\n\nRanked:\n1. \"Exhalation\".\n2. \"The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling\"\n3. \"Omphalos\"\n4. \"The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate\"\n5. \"Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom\"\n6. \"The Great Silence\"\n7. \"The Lifecycle of Software Objects\"\n8. \"What's Expected of Us\"\n9. \"Dacey's Patent Automatic Nanny\"\n\nNot as good as <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2297129092\">his first collection</a>, but what is?

    "review": "A fun, nasty, bitchy taxonomy of social class / psychological theory of the firm; a mishmash of economics, psychoanalysis and literary criticism; a series of massive blogposts apologising for being a book. \n\nIt splits employed people into three classes with terrible names - Leaders (\"Sociopaths\"), Loyalists (\"Clueless\"), Workers (\"Losers\") - and throws a massive amount of fictional evidence at each. That's obviously a formal hierarchy, Leaders > Loyalists > Workers, but Rao's first big left turn is to impose a second contradictory ordering on the 3 classes in developmental psychology terms: Clueless < Losers < Sociopaths. I like his subdivision of Losers into: Minimum-effort rationally-disengaged; Overperformers; future Sociopaths. It looks nasty, and Rao is uninterested in making it seem moral or immoral, but if this is how the leaders actually think, Rao is doing us (the 99%) a service. \n\nIs this system justified and true? No. Rao writes the best clickbait in the world, what he calls \"insight porn\".    It is the verbal equivalent of the noise an F1 engine makes on a 200m straight. The class theory in this would make for a great literary theory, a blueprint for future <i>Office Space</i>s. Myers-Briggs is marginally better than the dumb view of people as more or less defective versions of one character. So too is this better than \"bosses/workers\" cod Marxism. \n\n(He could have massively increased his audience and reduced unwanted connotations by renaming \"Losers\" to \"Workers\" \n<blockquote><i>        the Loser — really not a loser at all if you think about it — pays his dues, does not ask for much, and finds meaning in his life elsewhere\n</blockquote></i>)\n\nHe has a weird relationship with the amoral elites - he often says things like\n<blockquote><i>\n    In the big games of life, those involving the Darwinian dimensions of sex, money or power, we don’t get to define the rules. And it is only those games that can create social value.\n</blockquote></i>\nputting destiny and ultimate value in their hands. And he clearly thinks of himself as a post-reality-shock enlightened figure. And yet he rags on the inauthenticity, nihilism, cruelty, hollowness of his 'Sociopaths'.\n\nThere are dozens of acute, contentious, boggling passages like\n<blockquote><i>\n    For high-empathy people, all this is natural. By participating in collective feeling in groups of any size, and reacting to basic attraction/aversion drives, you can actually safely navigate all the complexity by instinct.\n    Not only can you do this, you will actually feel good doing this. This feeling is called happiness. I don’t have time to go into this, but happiness is entirely a social phenomenon, and there’s plenty of evidence that the best way (and from my reading, the only way) to get happy is to get sociable. Non-social feelings that seem like happiness turn out, upon further examination, to be distinct emotions like contentment, equanimity or hedonistic pleasure\n</blockquote></i>\n<blockquote><i>\n    the level of abstraction that we are concerned with, all theories of developmental psychology – Freud’s, Piaget’s, Erikson’s, Maslow’s – say roughly the same thing about arrested development: you are born Clueless and clue up in fits and starts. Bits of you get stuck and left behind at different points, and eventually you exhaust your capacity for real change and stall (though you may retain an illusion that you are on a path of “lifelong growth and learning,” itself a pattern of arrested development)\n</blockquote></i>\n\nI can imagine a teenager reading this and becoming absolutely insufferable. But much great writing can lend spurious superiority to fools - for instance Nietzsche.\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/\">Free! here</a>]",

If you are not registered, you will always be seen as a delusional weirdo and looked down upon, regardless of how many times you save the world.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nWhat's the name of the thing where you don't like a genre, but you do like deconstructions of it? I have it with horror (<i>Cabin in the Woods</i> and <i>Tucker and Dale vs Evil</i>!) and now, to my surprise, with shonen anime (<i>Evangelion</i>, <i>Mob Psycho</i> and this). Despite appearances OPM is a serious comment on credentialism, mob psychology, existentialism. The heroes and monsters are all ranked, but the ranking has little relation to their power. The unboundedly powerful protagonist is quite depressed because nothing in life is a challenge to him any more, no foe ever lasts.\r\n\r\n(Disappointed by the second series of the TV show, so turned to this.)\r\n\r\nThe art is <a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vqnhaxbaitw11.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c4cc33087cad3c5525aa2de6e30368a3659d3aa6\">surprisingly bad</a> (though the creator improved massively over a couple of years). Unlike most manga it looks like what it is: a five day rush job.

The other 99% percent of the time he's round-faced, blank, and unshaded to represent how little effort he is giving whatever perilous situation the world is in.\r\n\r\nStill, hilarious.",

I like him a lot, but I'm worried if I find myself agreeing with him, since he so often misleads himself.\r\n<blockquote><i>If I am indeed fated to sink into this pit of surveillance capitalism with the rest of you, I’d just as soon limit my fantasies about eating the rich to a venue that doesn’t shut you down the moment some community-standards algo thinks it sees an exposed nipple in a jpeg.</blockquote></i>\r\nEverything he does is <i>excessive</i>. Of course, this makes for good aesthetics and bad epistemics.\r\n\r\nLike <a href=\"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/\">Charlie Stross</a>, Watts reads horrifying things into the news, informed by the toxic half of history but also by a nebulous paranoia which leads them astray. (Representative sample from Stross: \"<i>[media incentive] has been weaponized, in conjunction with data mining of the piles of personal information social networks try to get us to disclose (in the pursuit of advertising bucks), to deliver toxic propaganda straight into the eyeballs of the most vulnerable — with consequences that are threaten to undermine the legitimacy of democratic governmance on a global scale.</i>\". Watts:\r\n<blockquote><i>Bureaucratic and political organisms are like any other kind; they exist primarily to perpetuate themselves at the expense of other systems. You cannot convince such an organism to act against its own short-term interests... It’s not really news, but we seem to be living in a soft dictatorship. The only choices we’re allowed to make are those which make no real difference... On a purely selfish level I’m happier than I’ve ever been in my life, happier than I deserve. Of course it won’t last. I do not expect to die peacefully, and I do not expect to die in any jurisdiction with a stable infrastructure. At least I don’t have to worry about the world I’m leaving behind for my children; I got sterilized in 1991.</blockquote></i>) \r\n\r\nThe two biggest fumbles here are his posts on <a href=\"https://replicationindex.com/2018/01/05/bem-retraction/\">Daryl Bem</a> and high-functioning <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/Hydrocephalus\">hydrocephalic</a> people. It is no shame to fall for either: these are highly respectable academic hoaxes, and Bem's methods were <a href=\"https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-statistical-crisis-in-science\">exactly as valid</a> as the average psychology paper of the early C21st. Watts' mistake isn't to insist that ESP is real, but to leap to the defence of the weird just because it is weird, to the point where he rejects Hume's maxim (\"<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00117/full\">Laplace's principle</a>\"), a basic incontrovertible <i>theorem</i> of <a href=\"https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Extraordinary_claims_require_extraordinary_evidence#Probability_theory\">Bayesian inference</a>. \r\n<blockquote><i>these results, whatever you thought of them, were at least as solid as those used to justify the release of new drugs to the consumer market. I liked that. It set things in perspective, although in hindsight, it probably said more about the abysmal state of Pharma regulation... I’m perfectly copacetic with the premise that psychology is broken. But if the field is really in such disrepair, why is it that none of those myriad less-rigorous papers acted as a wake-up call? Why snooze through so many decades of hack analysis only to pick on a paper which, by your own admission, is better than most?<br>\r\n\r\nThe question, here in the second decade of the 21st Century, is: what constitutes an “extraordinary claim”? A hundred years ago it would have been extraordinary to claim that a cat could be simultaneously dead and alive; fifty years ago it would have been extraordinary to claim that life existed above the boiling point of water, kilometers deep in the earth’s crust. Twenty years ago it was extraordinary to suggest that the universe was not only expanding but that the rate of expansion was accelerating. Today, physics concedes the theoretical possibility of time travel</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nAnother big miss is his emphasis on adaptive sociopathy as the cause of our problems, rather than say global coordination problems. He is also completely off the deep end on climate change as existential risk, sneering at anyone who disagrees, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmHh-cshTCMT8LX0Y5wSQm8FMBhaxhQ8OlOeRLkXIF0/edit#\">no</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/13/18660548/climate-change-human-civilization-existential-risk\">matter</a> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eJPjSZKyT4tcSGfFk/climate-change-is-in-general-not-an-existential-risk\">how</a> <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/will-climate-change-wipe-out-humanity-opinion-1440384\">well-informed</a>. \r\n<blockquote><i>there’s no denying that pretty much every problem in the biosphere hails from a common cause. Climate change, pollution, habitat loss, the emptying of biodiversity from land sea and air, an extinction rate unparalleled since the last asteroid and the transformation of our homeworld into a planet of weeds—all our fault, of course. There are simply too many of us. Over seven billion already, and we still can’t keep it in our pants.</blockquote></i>\r\nNotice the pattern: faced with an apparent dilemma, he happily chucks the strongest, most basic principles to maintain his paranoia (the principles \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\" or here \"it is good for people to have children if they want, good lives have worth\").\r\n\r\nThis bias would be entirely fine if he only admitted error later, about his predicted Trump race riots for instance.\r\n<blockquote><i>The real danger isn’t so much Trump himself, but the fact that his victory has unleashed and empowered an army of bigoted assholes down at street level. That’s what’s gonna do the most brutal damage.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nMost posts are entertaining but betray <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/\">one-way critical thinking</a>: for some reason he can barely see the other half of the world, that we are winning in <a href=\"https://sdg-tracker.org/\">all kinds of ways</a>. \r\n\r\nLots of learned and fun film reviews here: I relax, since criticism need have no truth-value. He likes 'Arrival' more than '<a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/Story-Of-Your-Life\">Story of Your Life</a>', which fits: the film is bombastic, paranoid, politicised, unsubtle.\r\n<blockquote><i>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/09/oprah-winfrey-swiss-apology-racist-treatment\">you</a> can buy the whole damn store and the street it sits on with pocket change; when you can buy the home of the asshole who just disrespected you and have it bulldozed; when you can use your influence to get that person fired in the blink of an eye and turn her social media life into a living hell—the fact that you don’t do any of those things does not mean that you’ve been oppressed. It means you’ve been merciful to someone you could just as easily squash like a bug... Marvel’s mutants are something like that. We’re dealing, after all, with people who can summon storm systems with their minds and melt steel with their eyes. Xavier can not only read any mind on the planet, he can freeze time, for fucksake. These have got to be the worst case-studies in oppression you could imagine.</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>it still seems a bit knee-jerky to complain about depictions of objectification in a movie explicitly designed to explore the ramifications of objectification. (You could always fall back on Foz Meadows’ rejoinder that “Depiction isn’t endorsement, but it is perpetuation”, so long as you’re the kind of person who’s willing to believe that Schindler’s List perpetuates anti-Semitism and The Handmaid’s Tale perpetuates misogyny.)</blockquote></i>\r\nWatts reacts with caution and indignation to any police presence, even a compassionate visit to the homeless man sleeping in his garden. It would crude to explain away Watts' style and worldview by reference to his unusually bad luck: his flesh-eating disease, his inexplicable beatdown and prosecution by border cops, his publishing travails, his scientific and romantic flops. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I'm probably only so down on him because I got so excited by <i>Blindsight</i> and its promise of actual science fiction by an actual scientist. He is certainly well above-average rigour for a political blogger, and well above-average imagination for anyone. Plus a star if you're in it for the ride, the anecdotes, and not for reliable info.",

    "review": "Good example of the most distinctive literary trend of the day: web serial fiction / wiki fiction. Also of the shortcomings of same: the committee fragmentariness and unmanageable hugeness. (I cut this short at page 1000. And this is only one of three giant ebooks of the whole wiki. Phew.)\r\n\r\nThat's the medium. Its genre is post-pulp post-Lovecraft urban fantasy-horror - the most popular genre? (Aside from old stalwarts, trash romance and MFA lit.) And style's the uncommon pseudoacademic register of Lovecraft's original pulp. \r\n\r\nIts achievement is to dispense with characterisation and rely entirely on atmosphere and startling concepts. There's no protagonist and only hints of antagonists (besides the thousands of SCP objects themselves). \r\n\r\nThe Foundation is ludicrously powerful - they've global jurisdiction over law enforcement, run hundreds of fatal human experiments, retain a vast staff and holdings. In order for this to work as horror, they need equally elevated foes - and so they do: they're always being infiltrated, manipulated, stolen from, exsanguinated or bombed. The Foundation commits many atrocities (contrast <i>Delta Green, Dresden Files, Agents of Shield, the X-Files</i>, which are much more anti-authority).\r\n\r\nIt has all the ordinary kinds of horror - monsters, disease, body horror, mind-rape, invisible forces, alien geometries - but also the greater, rare horror of <i>exponentiation</i>, of facing a foe with the potential to suddenly explode beyond all containment and never stop growing. Another distinctive bit is its <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-048\">meta</a> <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-049\">horror</a>: objects which know the rules of the story and about other objects.\r\n\r\nI recommend reading this with the images disabled. They're a labour of love, I know, but the imagination is easier to scare than the eye. Good queasy fun.",

    "review": "Unlikeable, admirable portrait of a diseased society, the disease signified by unbearable harassment of one of its young members. The book's unlikeable because it's realistic. In Burns' telling, 70s Ulster feels like ISIS in miniature, a taste of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2671118186\">Maoist China</a>: the complete infection of private life by horrible politics, slander, cruelty, and doom. The disease radiates out from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot-to-kill_policy_in_Northern_Ireland\">death squads</a> and <a href=\"https://thebrokenelbow.com/2018/10/01/how-the-ruc-special-branch-operated-during-the-troubles/\">Gestapo fuckery</a> of the \"traditionalists\" and the delusional gangster sociopathy, the kangaroo courts - the lash for women, and <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IRA%20six%20pack\">six-packs</a> for men - of the \"renouncers\".\r\n\r\nDecades of fear and vengeance bring out our worst, give psychopaths a foothold:\r\n<blockquote><i>To the [IRA] groupies too, it wasn't so much these men should be fighters for the cause as that they should be the particular individuals wielding substantial power and influence in the areas, They didn't have to be paramilitaries, didn't even have to be illegal, could have been anyone. It so happened though, that in the set-up of the time, in each of those totalitarian enclaves, it was the male paramilitaries who, more than anyone, ruled over the areas with final say...\r\n\r\nHe had to be leader, Number One, making her in turn Number One Attachment.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe sickest part of the book is the way that gossip feeds on itself, <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/excerpts-from-a-larger-discussion-about-simulacra/\">floats</a> free of reality - her ordinary stalker accuses Maybe-girlfriend of \"aggravated harassment\"; she's seen \"with\" [being harrassed by] a Big Man, so she becomes tainted/anointed with his aweing disrespectability; later, after he threatens to kill her boyfriend, the grapevine instead has it that she'd \"<i>tried to evade retribution for cheating on him with a car mechanic</i>\". A rape of social standing, of identity.\r\n\r\nBurns gives out great lines, poetic heft, to everyone, even vicious people like Ma and Milkman. \r\n<blockquote><i>Why can’t you take on board you’re not wanted, that your advances are not to be accepted, that it’s thanks but no thanks? You mean nothing to us, we don’t even think of you and another thing, you can’t just act with impunity, carrying on as if it didn’thappen, as if you didn’t start this, as if you didn’t stir things up. You’re a cat – that’s right, you heard us, a cat – a double cat! We don’t think you’re up to the level of even being a cat. But don’t you push us so far because this is aggravated harassment\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nMaybe-girlfriend's own register is a little tiring, bright and arch and digressive (but not enough to keep the  the pall of her surroundings lifted). It might be an attempt to balance out the setting with comically out-of-place lyricism, but if so it works strangely:\r\n<blockquote><i>'But understand, daughter,’ went on ma, ‘I'm not saying my rear cannot now fit in the chair because the chair's become too tight for it. It can still fit in. It’s just that now it encompasses a certain amount of extra inches or fractions of inches to which it has never acclimatised and which in the old days didn’t used to be.'\r\n'I knew now, of course, what she was driving at, though unsure still how to respond.... My response therefore, should be comparable to her own words, should be of like tone and weight in order to acknowledge and to respect her older status, even her originality indelineating the depth of her rear condition in relation to the chair she was speaking of.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThe Community hates the depressed and the upbeat (\"shiny\"), the chaste and the promiscuous, the deviation:\r\n<blockquote><i>And that was the trouble with the shiny people. Take a whole group of individuals who weren’t shiny, maybe a whole community, a whole nation, or maybe just a statelet immersed long-term on the physical and energetic planes in the dark mental energies; conditioned too, through years of personal and communal suffering, to be overladen with heaviness and grief and fear and anger – well, these people could not, not at the drop of a hat, be open to any bright shining button of a person stepping into their environment and shining upon them just like that... \r\n\r\nAs for the environment, that too, would object, backing up the pessimism of its people, which was what happened where I lived where the whole place always seemed to be in the dark. It was as if the electric lights were turned off, always turned off, even though dusk was over so they should have been turned on yet nobody was turning them on and nobody noticed either, they weren’t on...\r\n\r\nSo shiny was bad, and 'too sad' was bad, and 'too joyous' was bad, which meant you had to go around not being anything; also not thinking, least not at top level, which was why everybody kept their private thoughts safe and sound in the recesses underneath.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nI quite liked the purely-functional names - \"maybe-boyfriend\", \"third-brother-in-law\", \"longest friend from primary school\", \"Somebody McSomebody\", though I see it's not a popular methodology on here. I think \"Milkman\" is the only proper name in it. \r\n\r\nShe belabours a good metaphor (the sunset from the front cover): even the colour of a beautiful sunset is an ideological matter, for these locals. They've a particular cached thought - \"the sky is blue\" - and refuse to let a fancy intellectual (a spirited French teacher) make them notice that the sky is currently anything but blue. Blatant wilful error in the face of decisive evidence, maintained to express one's identity: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics\">welcome to the species</a>.\r\n\r\nReviewers call it funny, which it isn't really until Chapter Seven, until Milkman is gone and the <i>Carry On</i>-Tarantino part can kick off. There's <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9BVKdy7BXBE?t=73\">this</a>:\r\n<blockquote><i>Before Milkman, they had shot a binman, twobusdrivers, a road sweeper, a real milkman who was our milkman, then another person whodidn’t have any blue-collar or service-industry connections – all in mistake for Milkman. Thenthey shot Milkman. Then they played down the mistaken shootings while playing up theintended shooting, as if it had been Milkman and only Milkman they had shot all along.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nand\r\n<blockquote><i>\"You’re a female. He’s a male. You’re my sister-in-law and I don’t care how many of his family got murdered, he’s a bastard and would’ve been a bastard even if they hadn’t got murdered.\" They hadn’t got murdered. Only four had got murdered. The other two had been a suicide and an accidental death.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nVery tiring but worthy overall.",

    "review": "To use yourself for art you need a really interesting life, or sheer expressive skill - the ability to force anything to be interesting. Neither is easy: someone like Montaigne manages easily, but e.g. Rousseau doesn't (he just got there first, to the I Am Art game, so we have to talk about him).\r\n\r\nJoyce's life is only mildly interesting from the outside, so it falls to his evocation. I read this to find out whether to care about him, and I actually didn't until Part III, the rightly famous spiritual arc from apatheistic teenage kicks, to the ecstatic shame of submitting to the vast closed Catholic system, and through it to passionate agnosticism, anticlerical naturalism. Joyce's is the best portrait of the infinite terrorism of the Church:\r\n<blockquote><i>remember, my dear boys, that we have been sent into this world for one thing and for one thing alone: to do God’s holy will and to save our immortal souls. All else is worthless.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light laughter of a girl reached his burning ear. The frail, gay sound smote his heart more strongly than a trumpet blast, and, not daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked, into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma appeared before him and under her eyes the flood of shame rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind had subjected her or how his brute-like lust had torn and trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank under his very nostrils.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nAs a teen Stephen tries to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortification_of_the_flesh\">mortify</a> himself, to not look at women, to not eat well, to just look at <a href=\"http://dylanmoran.tumblr.com/post/511317711/i-grew-up-in-ireland-you-know-you-learn-to-feel\">the mud</a>. But he's too bright, too worldly and too proud. I cheered at the end of Part IV, when he throws off the yoke.\r\n\r\nThe prose is port wine: lovely if sipped. It is mostly monologue but the dialogue is the best bit. He is passionate about anything, e.g. algebra - \r\n<blockquote><i>The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's; and, when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated, began slowly to fold itself together again. The indices appearing and disappearing were eyes opening and closing; the eyes opening and closing were stars being born and being quenched. The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying him outward and inward. What music? The music came nearer and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness. The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space.\r\n\r\nThe dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the bale-fire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThe painful process of moving past family, nation, church, scholastic philosophy, to become yourself. Doing this in a country as maniacal about nation and church as eC20th Ireland was so much harder, and indeed he had to leave. He doesn't move past Art, and acquires a similarly  monomanaical view of it -\r\n<blockquote><i>[To be an artist], a priest of the eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nbut if my prose was as good as Joyce's maybe I couldn't have moved past it either. Like Nietzsche if he wasn't an edgelord.\r\n\r\nThat printers and governments treated Joyce and Lawrence the same is a laugh: Joyce has all of Lawrence's passion and none of the flat feet. Self-parody, odd humility, laughter at his own past dogmatism.\r\n\r\nHis memory - or his notetaking? - is amazing: scholars have spent lifetimes checking and relating <i>everything</i> in this to recorded history, and he's usually spot on about details (though he changes names). I don't think I could write anything as accurate, even in my surveillance society. \r\n\r\nFully half of my edition was taken up in footnotes and bibliophilia. (It also left Joyce's typos in, which is a bit much. In fact half the footnotes were as trivial as typos, e.g. pointing out where lines are reused from his draft <i>Stephen Hero</i>.)\r\n\r\n<i>Portrait</i> stops before the end of uni, before his <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/culture/why-james-joyce-had-to-leave-dublin-to-find-himself-1-5071133\">odyssey</a>, before his wife even. And much of the last section is a surprisingly flat, academic statement of Thomist aesthetics. But by then you've heard enough to love him anyway.",

    "review": "Of the war between Myopia and Utopia.\r\n\r\nHold on until page 125. That wait would be fatal in a first book, but everyone who makes it here, to book four, has proven hardier and will eat it gladly.\r\n\r\nNot a lot of war in this war novel before then. Instead, a Hufflepuff hum - faint in previous books, risen in this one. I don’t mean to be mean: the philosophical principle that nice things are important, philosophically rich is one of mine. But 9A, the narrator, is too much the overgrown child. They say “snugglier”. They emphasise snacking. Someone cries in every chapter I think. Like Odysseus. They also rave against free speech (though Palmer is a historian of censorship and should not be identified with 9A). \r\n\r\nNeotene domesticity is all very well for Becky Chambers, but it doesn’t gel with the other gigantic aesthetic banners of this work (the Enlightenment consummated and their language appropriated; a society transformed, deluding itself to be peaceful; the ideological roots of conflict, the inexorability of war’s logic, thus this realistic war between lovers and friends).\r\n\r\nThe achievement of this book - besides the truly baroque prose, the truly insane narration - is that it nearly succeeds in making every faction <i>reasonable</i>. Uncertainty justifies terrible things, the most terrible: distrust, surveillance, subterfuge, war.\r\n<spoiler>Palmer slips a few times. Kosala freaking out and blowing up the Almagest ex ante doesn’t change anything; Utopia-Mason already have the Alexander, space weapons. Moreover, her killing MASON is bound to kill many more people, and she’s not a consequentialist. I cover the great emptiness of Brillist anti-exploration in the spoiler below.</spoiler>\r\nI can’t remember this being done so well. Maybe in Hugo or Dumas.\r\n\r\nI am a big fan, but, so I dislike a lot about this series. I find the central conflict arbitrary, and the central psychological claim wrong. Actually maybe I just dislike the Ninth Anonymous, puppy Odysseus. \r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\n* Meme: “in the grim darkness of the C25th, mankind has divided into the elemental archetypes: jock, fash, hufflepuff, freud, stemlord, landlord, libertarian, people with a country of origin instead of a personality”. (This is no critique of Palmer when we remember that all such groupings will arise through weird partially random historical contingencies: the resulting categories don’t need to make sense and probably won’t.)\r\n\r\n* Common bit of silliness: <blockquote><i>“…languages are precious enough to be worth people dying for. A human life has infinite value, infinite consequences over the universe of space-time, but apparently They think a language is another order of infinity.”</i></blockquote> Piety. I can’t think of any language worth anyone dying for.\r\n\r\n<spoiler>In fact naive infinite ethics is the root of the conflict. Gordian says each human mind is infinite and so infinitely valuable; Utopia says the light cone is larger if not infinite. Jedd in the middle goes hmmm yeah can't see anything wrong with treating each person as equally valuable with a universe full of people, what a moral puzzle.</spoiler>\r\n\r\n* I like the Renaissance conceit of calling god The Great Author, and Jedd's conceit of calling the Utopians \"small authors\", small gods. Later, this is expanded into a huggy thing where all humans are small authors - in the afterword Palmer implies more: that we're all obeying the Utopian oath by working so much as 40 hours a week. I honour this thought - for instance a cleaner is in fact doing something of moral significance when they work, is in fact imperceptibly pulling on the rope that leads to the future. But it's a piety to say that all stories are equal-sized, that all pull the same. \r\n<blockquote><i>Many have described to me the journey from feeling they could never maintain such a high standard to realizing that we already are.</i></blockquote>\r\nNo, there is more to do.\r\n\r\n* So many hundreds of details, like the Brillist / Gordian double name (ideology and instantiation). Recalls GNU / Linux. The verisimilitude of mess.\r\n\r\n* The office of Anonymous doesn’t make sense. Has there ever been a writer who successfully spoke for humanity? Is solving epistemic logic puzzles really the only qualification you want for such a person?\r\n\r\n* The stable stagnation following the exponential age seems pretty implausible. Then there's the laughable smallness of the AI threat - one serial killer(!). (I suppose Utopia solved AI alignment. But then set-sets would have to be obsolete, unless the other Hives hated U-beasts, which they don't seem to.)\r\n\r\n* There’s a moving sequence about chronic fatigue, also one of Palmer’s personal crosses. Wheelchair as throne.\r\n\r\n* The book takes a slightly absurd view of the wisdom and effectiveness and moral stature of the UN. Maybe they get better over 400 years of irrelevance.\r\n\r\n* The plot is excessive, and I think it's intentionally difficult to track all the threads. Fine, but one bit goes too far for me: <spoiler>Achilles' dying speech implies alternate timelines and him as a multiverse hopper. And this in turn makes Palmer’s god less stupid, if he is the multiverse maximiser, <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/01/the-hour-i-first-believed/\">the only theodicy</a> I find even vaguely satisfying. Palmer's mainline theodicy is different: the universe is the offering of a blind mute god who wants to talk to a solipsist god. It's pretty cool.</spoiler>\r\n\r\n* The main characters spend lots of their most critical resources on documentation, history monging. Sniper’s chapter is bought at extreme expense, Mycroft’s whole shtick… This is <i>sorta</i> realistic - militaries have war artists and official bookworms. But it’s not usually the commanders and chief strategists scribbling for posterity as the death squads stalk their corridors. Palmer uses epistolary devices to great effect, but I find myself wishing they’d focus on the war for a sec.\r\n\r\n* I like the Mitsubishi a lot more in this one. <spoiler>disregarding their purported sadism in Mycroft’s literally hallucinated odyssey.</spoiler> Palmer makes me notice that the rich are a minority. Less vulnerable than the others, but there's a high floor to the vulnerability of any small group.\r\n\r\n* a bit of body horror and mind rape, be warned. <spoiler>Largely unpunished</spoiler>\r\n\r\n* The novel could do without religion. Jedd could be a vast noble alien, and we would have no need for This World’s Creator or even Bridger. <spoiler>The relics are Faust’s stated casus belli but others are easy to imagine.</spoiler> The narrators’ abjection before Jedd makes their tweeness worse. If there’s a god, you should wrestle him, not kneel. I could do without the extended <spoiler><i>Iliad</i> plot mirroring too.</spoiler>\r\n\r\n* Yet another fundamental problem: <spoiler>Jedd is not actually morally superior, which is why I don't like people kneeling to him. Absolute caring is not actually the perfect morality. He beats the monsters and Kosala and beautiful primitive Mason, but not Huxley. This is stupid for instance:\r\n<blockquote><i>Some occupations, mainly medical, may be judged too essential to subtract from, but for the rest, even the most important projects in the world”—tremble, Utopia and Gordian—“we must give up a portion of what would have been our life’s works to restore what we can of the devastated life’s works of the dead</i></blockquote>\r\nPostponing a death from heart attack is essential, but preventing deaths from aging isn't?? A debt to the past is lexicographically above all present and future people??\r\n\r\nHe <i>is</i> good at cutting knots, removing the bizarre theory-blind fatalism of the Censor, Gordian, the Mardis, and even Utopia. Nothing like the stupidity of a group with an overfit predictive model.\r\n\r\nI understand why there's no retribution in the aftermath of the war - the hugginess wins - but there's not even any proportionality. Utopia suffers more than Gordian!\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>No repercussions, then, for Gordian’s deceit? They get it all, even their collaboration, Bridger’s relics shared, thy Jehovah’s great wealth shared with the twin projects? That does not feel like justice.\r\n\r\nIt does not feel like goddess Nemesis, reader, who ravages the guilty, paying pain with pain. It feels like something better.</i></blockquote>This shows an unreasonable level of trust in Faust; if someone commits mass murder and mind rape once, you should expect them to do it again. By all means let them work on great projects for the world they defiled. But defang them first, and watch them.</spoiler>\r\n\r\n* The Masons are shown as heroic and vast in numbers, and yet they seem most of the way to fascism. With one bad MASON, they could ruin everything. Their superiority complex, retributive deontology, lack of individualism, and willing lack of freedom, are in far more severe contradiction to the Hive Alliance than the conflicts Palmer chooses to emphasise. Cornel is a liberal tyrant and a longtermist, and so they do good despite their terrible potential. (It’s not just their power - Utopia is powerful too. It’s the sheer lack of checks.) I wish I could say I find it unrealistic for a billion people to larp full-time as a Roman pleb or Mussolinian. <spoiler>Palmer knows all this and nerfs them in the denouement.</spoiler>\r\n\r\n* This book will age better than most, but parts of it ring trendy, sarky, Whedony. <spoiler>Like the reservationists coming out of nowhere to save the day.</spoiler> The bold, unclichéd treatment of gender of past books - as gravity, as a seductive force that can be covered up but not ignored, dimorphism as transgression, feminine arts as mind control, pronouns as a spicy personality marker. \r\n<blockquote><i>Their comportment invites it, that toxic artificial helplessness that coded feminine in olden days, and makes us all fall over ourselves wanting to do things for Heloïse, so much so that we stifle when they try to do things for themself.</i></blockquote>\r\nHere it gives way to a soppy constructionism, gender as conspiracy:\r\n<spoiler><blockquote><i> Madame toiled fifty years—fifty!—to revive patriarchy, narrowing the gates and cramming all high offices she could with the prey this mantis matriarch found easiest, all masculine in mind and genitalia… The Big Three leading this World War: matron Danaë, nursing Lesley, me, and not a dick among us. Where are they now, Madame? The artificial creatures, stiff and male and defined by their penises, you said would rise once war dispelled our supposedly fake equality?</i></blockquote> Well, you did contrive two dozen of your own male characters to coincidentally fall, to yield this panel. (She returns to the interesting moderate view in the great denouement.)</spoiler>\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\nBut the main gripe:\r\n\r\n<spoiler>The Gordian / Utopian split, the heart if the whole series, is not at all crisp. Earth vs Space. In vs Out. Unity vs fragmentation. Variety vs far greater variety. Life extension vs space exploration. Just let the ones who want to stay stay! People often pose life extension and space exploration as opposites, but they just aren’t, and so they are an unsuitable pair to base thousands of pages of conflict upon. I can’t take Faust seriously when he arbitrarily prefers current people to all of the thousands of worlds’ worth of people that space exploration would bring. He misses the great daily loss of entire galaxies, lost forever. He says he wants ems, which could pack the earth denser with minds. Well consider the greater packing of galaxies full of ems! The only way it makes sense is if they’re selfish, scrabbling to keep themselves alive. His war, his terrorism, is thus rooted in repeated errors, and the books are rooted in his war. I cannot love this.\r\n\r\nHow to have them clash deeply? Make Utopia pro-death! Science advances by funerals!</spoiler>\r\n\r\n<spoiler>In fact almost no part of Brillism makes sense. They hate set-sets for reducing natural personality and cognitive variety. But every set character we see is different from the others - and different from all natural characters! Sets are strictly increasing the variety of humanity. There’s nothing wrong with depicting bad philosophy, but it’s presented as a serious dilemma and I don’t think Palmer thinks Brillism is mistaken, just ruined by extremism and instrumental harm.</spoiler>\r\n\r\nThat said, nearly all the main characters are Explorers, taking one side.\r\n\r\nWhat would I have as the war’s great theme? The one from the last book is fantastic and underemphasised here: faith in a benevolent dictator vs pragmatic, aggressive scepticism. The second? Past-regarders and future-regarders. Long reflection vs Builders. Noble lie vs radical honesty. Bioconservatism vs transhumanism (represented already, a little). Theory vs praxis. Academia vs autodidacts. Stamp collecting vs engineering. All better than the chosen <spoiler>inwards vs out.</spoiler>\r\n\r\nWhat about Jedd’s philosophy? Like Yahweh, he has serious problems with respecting boundaries. That his subsumption and illiberal eternal hugging is taken so seriously is annoying. His lack of socialisation is half stupidity (demanding unconditional surrender at the cost of millions of lives), half defamiliar genius (why do people die, father?). <spoiler>That he is a particularist, favouring his family to the point where this has a serious chance of outweighing every other being and the course of history he chooses, belies his being particularly alien or godlike. Kin favourites is classic mammal.\r\n</spoiler>\r\n\r\nOne more deep disagreement: <spoiler>the war is said to be needed because humans are growing too comfortable to go to deep space. But this seems completely backwards to me. Just as a small minority of people in the richest parts of the world strain unprecedentedly without needing to - marathons, free soloing, biohacking, psychonautics, workaholism, and yes, space - I expect greater wealth and tech to inspire a similar proportion of contrarian strivers. And it only takes a few hundred offworld to seed all else. This is Utopia’s bizarre error / overconfidence, or Palmer’s error which makes itself true for them. Gordian have no blame in it, it’s enough for Utopia to believe it.</spoiler>\r\n\r\n<spoiler>Cato as Hephaestus, the divine inventor, yields a funny insight: all of this could have been avoided with sufficient technological progress. Can everyone have what they want, with sufficient technological progress? No, but it gets you pretty close.</spoiler>\r\n\r\nAnd yet I am so glad. There is nothing like it in C21st literature. I am only able to attack its philosophy (philosophies) because it’s so clearly and sympathetically drawn, because so intellectually ambitious. I am certain there are readers out there who view Utopia as trivially wrong, though it’s hard to imagine anyone loving <spoiler>terrorist Gordian. They’re from Ingolstad!</spoiler> \r\n\r\nCharacters routinely do the reasonable thing, including positive-sum trades with their mortal enemies, including instrumental harm for enormous stakes. It is one of the few works which sees the full stakes so clearly, which sees the world-historical significance of nerds, science fiction, and technical tat, both beneath and beyond the average novelist.\r\n\r\nOver-the-top, wrong, and great.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nClippings:\r\n<blockquote><i>I could see you, across the sky, the crowded sea, a thousand black and winged shapes for every tardy, well-meant Peace-dove. But humans began digging a canal across the Gulf of Corinth more than three thousand years ago and finished it in 1893. It’s worth trying things again. Apollo Guardian of Strangers knows that it’s worth trying things again. Especially for such a goal as peacefall.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<spoiler><blockquote>Why not both, Mycroft?\r\n<i>A week ago, I could not have answered you, reader, but now I think I can. The light is almost out. Space is too terrible, and Earth too good, not only space too hard but Earth too good, the gifts of Nature, more, for we have spent this hundred thousand years not only building boats and braving seas but tilling fields and planting cities, cultivating Earth’s great human garden. Even in the Exponential Age, when we wounded Mother Gaea with our garbage and our growth, we coaxed her back to health. Perhaps with Master Hobbes still there beside you, you imagine struggles are a constant of humanity’s condition, but our ancestors worked hard to make a better future for their children, and it worked. Life now is good. Not just for most, for all of us, such health, such plenty. And every year, as art and gardens prosper, we make this rich blue world that much harder to leave. Since we don’t have to. Not even to find our next frontier. Gordian has its own infinity which will not make us brave an airless sea, or weep upon a rock alone. Ever. They bypass grim Poseidon, leave the god who rings the Earth to stand mote-keeper of his black kingdom alone, and chance not to his mercy. Their branch is warm and easy, happy, without aspera, their frontier the Institute’s own motto Profundum et Fundamentum, the boundless deep and foundation: the mind. As progress husbanded by Gordian’s genius makes Earth yet happier...</i></blockquote></spoiler>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Free Speech, that old tool of plutocracy, the intoxicating, rosy blossom under whose petals parasite lies can breed and multiply until they devour all the garden. None of us wants that. I hope none of us wants that, but there are still Free Speech zealots in this day and age, and they’re just the type to have communications tech, to build a radio or study Morse code, and volunteer to join our network as a link and pass on . . . ​death. I’m panicking, I know it. Everyone understands why we need censorship... I do believe it was a pretty thing once, Free Speech, such a lofty notion, but we outgrew it with our communications revolution, as with our machine guns we outgrew pretty chivalry. \r\n</i></blockquote> Odium! Also odious:\r\n<blockquote><i>our true beliefs are visible in what pokes above the psyche’s surface in those moments when the overflowing heart sings out in gratitude, and then we learn what name it calls: Nature, Humanity, Reason, God, Gaea, Fate, subtle Prometheus, or Providence that takes so much but gives this.</i></blockquote>\r\n(every worldview a religion - I spit. Some less so than others!)\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>I hope the ideas, the fragile and imperfect Hives of 2454, and the battered but changing-for-the-better Hives of 2456, will help you rise with strength tomorrow morning as you lift your oar, or pack, or first aid kit, whatever task at hand, they’re all the oar so long as you still carry in your breast the ancient spark, contagious, shared from breast to breast, that has died out a thousand times, but never yet in every breast at once. We will.</i></blockquote>",

    "review": "Thoughtful and lucid nontechnical essays on the very different structures hiding behind the vague anticoncept 'capitalism'. The title alone beats most leftists and rightists, who tend to tacitly deny the existence of good or bad capitalisms, respectively. (Where by good we mean \"good for growth and eliminating poverty\".) The authors go further of course, with four ideal types:\r\n\r\n* <i>state-guided capitalism</i> (China, 60s Japan, Singapore)\r\n* <i>big-firm capitalism</i> (South Korea, Japan, France, North Carolina)\r\n* <i>entrepreneurial capitalism</i> - high growth from small companies doing actually new things, high distribution of gains - (Ireland, UK, California)\r\n* <i>oligarchic capitalism</i> - low growth, low distribution of gains - (Russia, Italy, sometimes South Korea)\r\n\r\nThey tie these to specific policies, often lacking in these kinds of books. They also accept that what's \"good\" economic policy depends on your existing base (cf. Ha-Joon Chang's argument for trade barriers for pre-industrial countries). Most of the book is about the conditions and effects of entrepreneurship, but they also find big firms actually necessary (\"<i>the best form of capitalism is a blend of entrepreneurial and big-firm</i>\"), well before <a href=\"https://read.macmillan.com/lp/big-business-by-tyler-cowen/\">Tyler Cowen</a>.\r\n\r\nDecent paean to the moral importance of growth too:\r\n<blockquote><i>slow growth, especially when coupled with widening inequality, can provide an environment that breeds distrust and often hate. It is not an accident that some of the worst periods of intolerance to African Americans and immigrants in United States history (the late 1800s, the 1930s, 1970s) occurred during periods of slow or negative growth. The worst-case example of this was, of course, the rise of Nazism...\r\n\r\nMichael Mandel: 'Such technology-driven growth is essential if we are not to drown in our own problems... Without breakthroughs in medical science, it won't be possible to supply the healthh care to a generation of aging Americans without bankrupting the young. Without breakthroughs in energy production, it won't be possible to bring Third World economies up to industrialised living standards without badly damaging the environment...' <i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>If annual growth of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 100 years average\r\nlabor productivity is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earnings will have risen<br>\r\n2%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 620%\r\n3% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1820%\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nGood book for anyone who thinks they hate economics, or economists, or neoclassical economics, or growth itself. Certainly much more readable and fair than Piketty's mega-bestseller. (For very adversarial people, better to start with <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filthy_Lucre:_Economics_for_People_Who_Hate_Capitalism\">Filthy Lucre</a></i>, which analyses good and bad forms of competition.)",

    "review": "I was amazed that this is the only book about her reception in Scotland. Growing up during Blair, Thatcher was still by far the most famous politician in Scotland; small children knew to hate her, to sing rhymes about <a href=\"\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/uk_confidential/1095121.stm  \">one of her policies</a>.\r\n\r\nBut actually our booklessness fits - we don't really analyse why she was a demon. Adults might mutter something about the poll tax or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QOZzFXolGJc\">the shipyards</a> or the <i>Belgrano</i>, but in general people don't think about what she actually did, they just follow the received wisdom that she was a bloodthirsty high-heid ogre who killed jobs for fun. \r\n\r\n(If Malcolm Rifkind is willing to write the foreword for your book, you'd be forgiven for inferring something about its slant - and indeed MR characterises the opposition as merely disliking a bossy English woman speaking down to them in RP. This is risible, and predictably risible.)\r\n\r\nTorrance reports the month-by-month history. He's impatient with kneejerk anti-Thatcherism, the kind which forgets her relative electoral gains in '79 and '83, which ignores the global forces of deindustrialisation which Thatcher had relatively little power over (only unused power to slow and soften the effects). There's no Tories shyer than Scottish Tories, but they're there - <a href=\"\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Kingdom_general_election_in_Scotland\">29%</a> in the last election, back up to early Thatcher levels.\r\n\r\nShe repeatedly used Scotland as a policy testing ground, in what it's fair to call naked opportunism. (Little to lose by 1989, electorally.) She galvanised opposition and gave the country an Other to unite against. We threw eggs, rioted against regressive taxation, and drew funny satire - but bought our council houses off her, hoovered up our shares in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Group#Privatisation\">BT</a> and Steel, and mostly accepted her careerist world, disorganised labour. The poll tax finished her - but she still <i>won</i>, and all it cost her was a century of hatred.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this I still don't know what the bottom line is.",

    "review": "Amazed that this is from 1995; its concerns feel very current - too current. The nations of the world collapse from cryptocurrency destroying the tax base; they are replaced with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Polystate-Thought-Experiment-Distributed-Government-ebook/dp/B00IM5EM7W\">voluntary</a> <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/\">ideological associations</a>, including trads (\"neo-Victorians\" and techno-Confucians) who are shown thriving where others suffer civil war, state failure, and ordinary poverty and abuse. Everyone has fancy nanotechnology, which solves absolute poverty and allows massive structures to be built of solid diamond.\n\nThat's all in the background, where the foreground is a theory of education and rebellion, of social degeneration and regeneration. The leader of the Victorians designs the best educational game ever, a 12-year-long adventure game with live narration. He does this because there's a shortage of subversion and rebellion in his society, and he wants to train his granddaughter to be independent. (He also says the neo-Vickys have an associated shortage of great artists, but to put it mildly this is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Victorian_novelists\">not something</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_artists#Born_1800%E2%80%931899\">the originals</a> suffered.)\n\nIn particular, Stephenson was <a href=\"http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html\">a bit</a> obsessed with moral relativism in the 90s; he harps on the superiority of realism, or communitarianism, or status regulation, or sincerity, or something, in most of his books. Superficially, his concern matches one annoying strain of internet writing of the last few years - the clickbait strawmaneering of the Petersons and the Lindsays. But French Theory <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/french-thought-once-dazzled-the-world-what-went-wrong\">fell</a> in the meantime, outside of a few academic subcultures with little influence, so Stephenson can be right while these guys are wrong. An excess of scepticism and irony - a deficit of shaming and judgment - does not strike me as the first problem with the mores of 2020.\n\nStephenson saves most of the nice bits of the book for the Vickys, and his attempt to recover what was good about the original Victorians (their energy, inventiveness, duty, taste) ignores a lot of what was bad about them. (Though he actively endorses their hypocrisy about sex, he would have to think again about their betraying their Christian universalism with retributive justice and imperialism.)\n<blockquote><i>\n\"when I was a young man, hypocrisy was deemed the worst of vices,\" Finkle-McGraw said. \"It was all because of moral relativism. You see, in that sort of a climate, you are not allowed to criticise others--after all, if there is no absolute right and wrong, then what grounds is there for criticism?...\n\n\"Now, this led to a good deal of general frustration, for people are naturally censorious and love nothing better than to criticise others' shortcomings. And so it was that they seized on hypocrisy and elevated it from a ubiquitous peccadillo into the monarch of all vices. For, you see, even if there is no right and wrong, you can find grounds to criticise another person by contrasting what he has espoused with what he has actually done... Virtually all political discourse in the days of my youth was devoted to the ferreting out of hypocrisy.\"\n\n\"That we occasionally violate our own stated moral code,\" Major Napier said, working it through, \"does not imply that we are insincere in espousing that code.\" \n\"Of course not,\" Finkle-McGraw said. \"It's perfectly obvious, really. No one ever said that it was easy to hew to a strict code of conduct.\"\n</blockquote></i>\n\nHaving \"Victorian\" characters means he gets to have fun with his dialogue; there are dozens of words I've never seen before in this, and several children crafting exquisitely balanced subordinate clauses.\n\nAbout a third too long, and that's with him completely truncating the excellent Judge Fang plotline. As always, he is incapable of writing a good ending. Maybe 4 stars on re-read. ",

    "review": "An enormous collection of novels - a spy thriller, and a military farce, and a comparative history (of Showa Japan, Churchill Britain, Roosevelt America, the pre- and post-Marcos Philippines), and an oral history of computing, and a modern legal psychodrama, and a family saga of three large dynasties. And a divisive book:\r\n\r\n1) It is extremely focussed on men and masculine mindset - guts and brutality, mathematical facility, mind-numbing horniness, how shit works, emotional impermeability, pride in being a stereotype. (Scroll down to see reviews reacting in highly exaggerated ways to this fact, with either horror or delight.) \r\n<blockquote><i>Men who believe that they are accomplishing </i>something<i> by speaking speak in a different way from men who believe that speaking is a waste of time... there might be a third category... [Waterhouse] speaks, not as a way of telling you a bunch of stuff he's already figured out, but as a way of making up a bunch of new shit as he goes along. And he always seems to be hoping that you'll join in. Which no one ever does.</blockquote></i>\r\nOn the wonder and absurdity of social etiquette:<blockquote><i>The room contains a few dozen living human bodies, each one a big sack of guts and fluids so highly compressed that it will squirt for a few yards when pierced. Each one is built around an armature of 206 bones connected to each other by notoriously fault-prone joints that are given to obnoxious creaking, grinding, and popping noises when they are in other than pristine condition. This structure is draped with throbbing steak, inflated with clenching air sacks, and pierced by a Gordian sewer filled with burbling acid and compressed gas and asquirt with vile enzymes and solvents produced by many dark, gamy nuggets of genetically programmed meat strung along its length. Slugs of dissolving food are forced down this sloppy labyrinth by serialized convulsions, decaying into gas, liquid, and solid matter which must all be regularly vented to the outside world lest the owner go toxic and drop dead. Spherical, gel-packed cameras swivel in mucus greased ball joints. Infinite phalanxes of cilia beat back invading particles, encapsulate them in goo for later disposal. In each body a centrally located muscle flails away at an eternal, circulating torrent of pressurized gravy. And yet, despite all of this, not one of those bodies makes a single sound during the sultan's speech.</blockquote></i>\r\nHalf of this is an accurate portrayal of 40s gender politics, half a defensive reaction to contemporary blank-slateism. I don't think it's a malign kind of masculinity, though there are only a couple of female characters who don't have at least peripheral or inverted sexiness - if you can't handle that I'd avoid it. A good point to bail out would be the bit where Waterhouse models the effect of masturbation vs sex on his cognition as a periodic timeseries. I'm very hard to offend, but the <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/04/style-guide-not-sounding-like-an-evil-robot/\">constant use</a> of \"females\" got to me, by page 400.\r\n<blockquote><i>Randy stares directly into the eyes of the female customs official and says, \"The Internet.\" Totally factitious understanding dawns on the woman’s face, and her eyes ping bosswards. The boss, still deeply absorbed in an article about the next generation of high-speed routers, shoves out his lower lip and nods, like every other nineties American male who senses that knowing this stuff is now as intrinsic to maleness as changing flat tires was to Dad. \"I hear that’s really exciting now,\" the woman says in a completely different tone of voice, and begins scooping Randy’s stuff together into a big pile so that he can repack it. Suddenly the spell is broken, Randy is a member in good standing of American society again, having cheerfully endured this process of being ritually goosed by the Government.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n2) It is also a partisan in the Arts vs STEM \"culture war\". (In fact Stephenson is often dismissive of all academia - \"<i>grad students existed not to learn things but to relieve the tenured faculty members of tiresome burdens such as educating people and doing research</i>\".) One of the most important scenes in the book shows a lone techie clashing with a self-appointed jury of stereotypically appalling critical theorists: they speak nonsense about an objective matter, he correctly calls them on it, they cover him in ad hominem bulverism until he gives in. It's not without nuance: his champion in the fight Randy is later shown sulking and reliving it and admitting his own pettiness:\r\n<blockquote><i>“I strenuously object to being labeled and pigeonholed and stereotyped as a technocrat,” Randy said, deliberately using oppressed-person’s language maybe in an attempt to turn their weapons against them but more likely (he thinks, lying in bed at three A.M. in the Manila Hotel) out of an uncontrollable urge to be a prick.</i></blockquote> \r\n\r\n3) There are a lot of coincidences, much more than the novelistic baseline. Characters meet Atanasoff and Turing and Reagan and MacArthur. (A Nazi submarine captain makes a sneering reference to a bureaucratic nightmare being something out of \"that Jew Kafka\". I thought this was an absurd anachronism, but looking into it, the Nazi could easily have read him, but could not have made the reference to a Brit and expected it to stick. English translation of <i>Das Schloss</i> in 1930 but it didn't take off until after the war.) This is cute/trite on its own, but I find it helpful to imagine Stephenson looking down at history, selecting a <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/Littlewood\">particularly interesting sub-graph</a> from the population\r\n\r\n4) There are lots of info-dumps. Large sections of this are indistiguishable from nonfiction. (\"<i>This pause is called the horizontal retrace interval. Another one will occur...</i>\") People seem to hate this, but it is fine since it's done through aspie characters who absolutely do talk like that.\r\n\r\n5) It has a lot of pulpy Feats, fuck-yeah setpieces which fiction this good usually foregoes.     Tropical headhunters; escape from a collapsing mineshaft; cryptocurrency in the 90s; tactical blackface; drinking and lolling with your Nazi captors; etc.\r\n<blockquote><i>It would be an idyllic tropical paradise of not for the malaria, the insects, the constant diarrhea and resulting hemorrhoids, and the fact that the people are dirty and smell bad and deat each other and use human heads for decoration.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's easy to miss the uniting theme, and thus call it \"not a novel\" or whatever, because it only unmasks on p.791. It is Ares v Athena, rage v cunning, politics v engineering, normies v geeks, law v ethics, <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/\">conflict v mistake</a>, local maxima v the search for the global. This overloaded binary is embodied in Andrew v Randy, the Dentist v Avi, Rudy v Göring, All of Japan v Dengo.\r\n\r\nNow, it suits me to have litigious bastards and culture-warriors be the inheritors of Ares, of mindless destruction. But it would be silly to think that the stakes are comparable between the plot strands: it's WWII vs the Struggles of Some Cool Crypto Entrepreneurs. But Stephenson is obviously not equating them, and might be pointing out that stakes are now in general lower, even when you're up against contemporary gangsters.\r\n\r\nAnother giant theme is the emergence of one new masculinity, beyond the taciturn physical hero: the geek. This is the \"third category\" above. (Is this really that new? Isn't it just the Scholar?)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<i>Misc notes</i>\r\n\r\n* Waterhouse seems to be taking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Tutte\">Bill Tutte</a>'s space in history and seizing it for America but ok.\r\n\r\n* Bobby Shaftoe is the noblest junkie character I've ever seen - ingenious in his pursuit of morphine, but slightly more keen on Marine honour than on it.\r\n\r\n* I was not expecting Stephenson to use <i>converting to Christianity</i> as the symbol for Dengo leaving sick ultranationalism behind. Compassion and liberalism are far larger and better than the Christian launchpad they happened to use, after all.\r\n\r\n* Relatedly there's his preference for cute family-values Christianity over postmodern critical theory:\r\n<blockquote><i>To translate it into UNIX system administration terms (Randy’s fundamental metaphor for just about everything), the post-modern, politically correct atheists were like people who had suddenly found themselves in charge of a big and unfathomably complex computer system (viz, society) with no documentation or instructions of any kind, and so whose only way to keep the thing running was to invent and enforce certain rules with a kind of neo-Puritanical rigor, because they were at a loss to deal with any deviations from what they saw as the norm. Whereas people who were wired into a church were like UNIX system administrators who, while they might not understand everything, at least had some documentation, some FAQs and How-tos and README files, providing some guidance on what to do when things got out of whack. </blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* Some surprisingly deft notes on kink and the exogenous/preconscious nature of sexuality, in the bit where they're spying on Tom Howard.\r\n\r\n* This line accurately portrays the mindset of certain wizard types like Turing:\r\n<blockquote><i>It is exciting to discover electrons and figure out the equations that govern their movement; it is boring to use those principles to design electric can openers.</i></blockquote>\r\nthough it is discreditable and nongeneralisable to hold.\r\n\r\n* I learned a lot of words. \r\n\r\n* There are dozens and dozens of depictions of Japanese war crimes before we get any note paid to the horrendous suffering of the Japanese troops. But after that it is suitably even-handed in its tragedy. One of the saddest sentences I've ever read: \"They are strafing the survivors\".\r\n\r\n* Root is a tech determinist about the war - the Allies won because their tech was better, end-of. I seriously doubt historians would go with this. \r\n\r\n* <spoiler>I struggle to fit Root into the world. His death and reappearance is the only magical element in the entire thing (coincidences aside), and clashes with the main bloody theme. I am toying with the idea that Root is a collective name like James Bond, but I suppose it'll just be some switcheroo bullshit.</spoiler>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere's a lot wrong with it - it's about twice as long as it needs to be, the gender stuff is overdone, it is intentionally annoying to its outgroup, succumbing to 'conflict theory', and none of its antagonists (Loeb, the Dentist, Wing, Crocodile) are fleshed out <i>despite him having 900 pages of opportunities for fleshing them</i> -  but it's grand, clever, full of ideas, funny, full of great setpieces, and foresaw a couple of things about our decade.",

    "review": "Nice mission: to teach computer logic to humans to help them think. (Returning logic to its normative roots.) But Kowalski immediately strays from this to <i>also</i> try to build \"<i>a comprehensive, logic-based theory of human intelligence</i>\". By aiming at both pragmatic self-help and grand, metaphysical, qualitative psychology, it's too ambitious - or rather, appropriately ambitious but using the wrong tools. \r\n\r\n(The right tools are unknown but probably include decision theory, statistics, distributed representations, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function\">Bayesian</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding\">predictive</a> brain - none of which Kowalski foregrounds. He talks about inferring causes - without using Causal Inference; about doing abduction - without probabilities; about production systems - without the more mature Predictive Processing calculus.)\r\n \r\nKowalski praises a few bad theories, like Fodor's version of language of thought, and Gardner's multiple intelligences. (And Cyc isn't marked as a failure.) But also good theories: dual-process psychology, Sperber's relevance theory.\r\n\r\nThe best bit is where he links cognitive biases to naive logical rules\r\n<blockquote><i>The computational interpretation [of dual process theory] is that, when an agent is deliberative, its behaviour is controlled by a high-level program, which manipulates symbols that have meaningful interpretations in the environment. But when the agent is intuitive, its behaviour is generated by a low-level program or physical device... \r\n\r\n        The logical interpretation of dual process theories is that, when an agent is deliberative, its behaviour is generated by reasoning with high-level goals and beliefs. When the agent is intuitive, its behaviour is determined by low-level input–output associations, even if these associations can also be represented in logical form.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n    It's also a friendly introduction to more recent logics. Perhaps too friendly - if you think that formal symbols always make things harder to think about, I recommend comparing learning logic from this vs a good semiformal text like <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1638937.Logic\">Tomassi</a>. The bloat of English compared to symbols is about 20x, and the overheads are impossible to miss.\r\n\r\nIt is at least what I hoped it would be: a very clear introduction to good old \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence\">GOFAI</a>\" in all its rigour, grandiosity and narrowness. (There are maybe 600 definitions in this.)  I wanted a logician's (or logic programmer's) view on AI, and I got it (from the technical appendices). CL is impressive and authoritative on a small number of tasks, but it's just not generally promising, and hasn't been for a long time. This 2011 book read like a time capsule from the 1970s, before Prolog and Cyc had soured, before the Winter. (I should clarify that inductive logic programming <a href=\"https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11172\">is a live research programme</a> - I'm going to work on it myself - but <i>only</i> in combination with the ruling statistical methods.) I actually don't understand how he can think that this approach is the answer - is it unkind to put it down to decades of sunk cost?\r\n\r\n    I also thought it might be a more rigorous version of <i>Algorithms to Live By</i>, and I suppose it is, but at the cost of its practicality.",

But I'm already persuaded by normal channels about the benefits of fasting, so this is for the art of it.\r\n\r\nMuch better than it looks. He is probably too enthusiastic about fasting and keto (though his definition is broad: he skips breakfast every day to get a 16 hour mini-fast). But the evidence is solid for occasional fasts (for weight maintenance in a superstimulating environment, anti-inflammation, immune health, \"autophagy\" cleanup time).\r\n\r\nVery practical. Most important:\r\n<blockquote><i>Not getting enough electrolytes is the most common reason why people fail fasting \r\nfor longer periods of time. if you only consume pure water, then you’re practically just flushing out all of the essential minerals from your body, which can cause serious dehydration and \r\nproblems with nerves.\r\n\r\nThe most important electrolytes you need are sodium, magnesium, and potassium. But you also have to pay attention to the quantities [given]...\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nFree here, though it plugs his paid diet regime.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.siimland.co/full-guide-to-intermittent-fasting/",

    "review": "Pretty sensible but very long-winded and staid. I suppose it is actually quite vigorous and irreverent, coming from an organisation man:\r\n<blockquote><i>study can be a substitute for productive work</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>   Darwin considered himself to be a geologist, but the world remembers largely his biology. Should Goethe be in the literature, biology, physics, or philosophy department? He actually was most proud of his work on optics, though that work was largely flawed. Would Newton or Fisher find comfortable academic niches today?</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>    All graduate students are taught that it is essential to become an expert. As a short-term goal this is, of course, valid. Academic search committees are also looking for experts. As a lifestyle, however, becoming an expert can inhibit creativity... As one becomes more of an expert, a larger and more complex network of facts and explanations accumulates and solidifies, making it difficult to entertain radical alternative ideas or to recognize new problems... An Aristotle or Freud may create a set of bars within which most people pace rigidly, never noticing clues from outside the cage</blockquote></i>\r\n<blockquote><i>    it is much more likely that one can work at 100% mental clarity for about four hours. If one keeps this in mind, then a distinction can be made between critical issues that need full clarity and intense effort, which become part of the four hours of work per day, and those parts of a project that are routine and become part of the rest of the day... returning calls, coding a clearly designed subroutine, ordering equipment, attending seminars, editing reports, etc</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nBut these are the only interesting bits in 300 pages. This is true but the book doesn't help much:\r\n<blockquote><i> scientists are largely uncoached and are rarely introspective. They spend a lot of\r\ntime studying their disciplinary subject matter, but almost no time learning strategies of problem solving</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* He gives examples from <i>many</i> different domains (ecology, epidemiology, physics, hardware), but so I spotted some errors.\r\n* A new record! Loehle cites a crashing falsehood on p.2, and several times elsewhere: Gardner's DOA <a href=\"https://researched.org.uk/myth-busting-gardners-multiple-intelligences/\">theory of multiple intelligences</a>. And he naively teases out the strategic implications. He harps on this theme repeatedly - e.g. this is also flatly false: <i>above a certain minimal level, IQ and college grades are not predictive of <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c6ef/f99ef5b7423b882b2e34034f910508fc50c6.pdf\">productivity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2007-strenze.pdf\">success</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-IQ-of-Nobel-Laureates\">innovation</a></i>.\r\n* He tries to talk about software but is stuck in the 90s. He has no sense of open-sourcing software as the most successful strategy (witness <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost#Awards\">XGB</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras#Traction\">Chollet</a>).\r\n* It tries to also appeal to business people, for some reason. Half the examples and advice are about corporate decisionmaking (<i>The proper focus or perspective is essential when looking at business performance.</i>) This is distracting and makes it feel generic, belies the title.\r\n* His \"new model of the scientific method\" is vague and doesn't deserve the word.\r\n* The chapter on social distortions (credit stealing, cherry-picking, trends and irrational effects of publication timing) is ok, just ahead of the Replication crisis curve.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway: as a scientist you <i>want</i> problems. But not just any problem - something that both doesn't fit, & has important implications. Advice I read in this, or read into it:  \r\n\r\n* A theory can be inconsistent or incomplete: one generate contradiction, the other keeps explanations weak.\r\n* Paradoxes are shortcuts to the frontier. Look for heated debates and find a synthesis / circumvention. When you have one: Find tacit assumptions; Make new distinctions; Operationalise!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n(Alternative books: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7672554-the-art-of-the-soluble\">Medawar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/437689.Advice_for_a_Young_Investigator\">Cajal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192221.How_to_Solve_It\">Polya</a>, <a href=\"https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/firbush/hamming.pdf\">Hamming</a>, anything by Feynman. <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/~jsteinhardt/ResearchasaStochasticDecisionProcess.html\">Stenhardt's model</a> is more rigorous than the rest put together but I don't know if it's helpful.)",

    "review": "<blockquote><i>probability is not really about numbers, it is about the structure of reasoning </blockquote></i>-Glen Shafer<br>\r\nBy no means an introductory book; even chapter 1 will mean little to you if you haven't tried to model situations with both formal logic and probabilities before. (Some set theory wouldn't go amiss either.) Parts of it treat nearly-irrelevant dead controversies, just because he was still fighting off the McCarthy / production systems programme in the late Eighties. (For instance, I learned Dempster-Shafer theory in class, and it is <a href=\"https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/161879782549/bayes-a-kinda-sorta-masterpost\">sorta interesting</a> and neatly evades Cox's theorem, but I still expect never to have to use it. It gets more than 50 pages here.) Bayesian networks, ingenious and progressive as they were, have peaked in use, though <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836213/#__sec5title\">their</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06539\">children</a> are still cutting edge and invaluable for human and nonhuman reasoning.\r\n\r\nAll that said: Pearl thinks very hard about ultimate matters. He didn't develop Bayesian networks (and causal models) as a hack, but instead as a consequence of showing probabilities to be better than the alternatives when tweaked for computation, subjective Bayesianism to be capable of handling causal inference, graphs as the natural data structure for both relevance and cause, and the causal/evidential decision theory distinction as primal. \r\n<blockquote><i>On the surface, there is really no compelling reason that beliefs, being mental dispositions about unrepeatable and often unobservable events, should combine by the laws of proportions that govern repeatable trials such as the outcomes of gambling devices.  The primary appeal of probability theory is its ability to express useful qualitative relationships among beliefs and to process these relationships in a way that yields intuitively plausible conclusions…  What we wish to stress here is that the fortunate match between human intuition and the laws of proportions is not a coincidence. It came about because beliefs are formed not in a vacuum but rather as a distillation of sensory experiences... \r\n\r\nWe therefore take probability calculus as an initial model of human reasoning from which more refined models may originate, if needed. By exploring the limits of probability in machine implementations, we hope to identify conditions under which extensions, refinements and simplifications are warranted.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nBuilding AI as feedback for formal epistemology! My favourite philosophers are technical like David Lewis; my favourite technical people are philosophical like Pearl. \r\n\r\nHe's also very good at taking us through a derivation and underlining the big implications (e.g. P(A) = \\sum P(A|B_i)  P(B_i) as a model for hypothetical reasoning: belief in event A is a weighted sum over belief in all the ways A can obtain). There's plenty of maths in here but I never struggled much, probably because of this qualitative care of his.\r\n\r\n<i>PRIS</i> beats the arse off <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36204378-the-book-of-why\">his own 2018 effort</a>, perhaps because at this point he was still working incredibly hard to understand and synthesise competing approaches. Hard to rate. But if you want to seriously think about AI, you'll want to read it at some point.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\n<i>Misc notes</i>\r\n\r\n* McCarthy is to probabilities as <a href=\"https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/1288/did-minsky-and-papert-know-that-multi-layer-perceptrons-could-solve-xor\">Minsky is to neural nets</a>. He sent us down a rabbit hole, chasing nonmonotonic logic solutions to a numerical problem. (See also Chomsky vs prob language models.)\r\n* <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RgkqLqkg8vLhsYpfh/fake-causality\">Others</a> have used Pearl's vision to explain the ideal form of rationality, which humans depart from.\r\n* His discussion of extensional (hacking out a generalised logic) vs intensional (possible-world counting) approaches to uncertainty seems fundamental to me, bedrock.\r\n* The heart of the matter: Bayesnets are O(n) in variables, but actually with some complicated tweaks so are Dempster-Shafer galleries.\r\n* Dempster-Shafer is an interesting example of the contingency of (the context of discovery of) mathematics. It didn't have to be developed (since probs are adequate for so much), and yet it was, and it evades the normal arguments against other uncertainty measures and is thus alive, if unpopular. (Compare noneuclidean geometries.) What other dominant calculi would get similarly competing theories, if we threw a few decades of brilliance at them?",

(Imagine how disconcerting it would be if medical or law school graduates couldn’t get jobs as doctors or lawyers, respectively.)</blockquote></i>\r\nStrange one. It's 100 pages of minor mental breakdowns, ten thousand hours of mind-numbing gruntwork, stupid status games, and disillusionment - all in plain, businesslike, affectless prose. Also, there's very little technical detail in it. You'd think he was describing painting a house, rather than a painful initiation into the partially-insane system of <i>placing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science\">logic incarnate</a> in harness</i> (a system with surprisingly weak links to discovery and progress).\r\n<blockquote><i>research was my only job, and I wouldn’t be able to earn a degree unless I succeeded at it.

The top CS schools don't let you graduate until you get 4 papers in \"top\" conferences: layers upon layers of luck and gatekeeping, only modestly correlated with your efforts. Oh, and you are unlikely to have much choice of project either. A recipe for misery. This is at the very top of the game, too: Stanford with full funding and annual internships at the big lads. It is both reassuring and horrifying to hear that elite groups waste months and submit total shit sometimes.\r\n<i><blockquote>In the end, it took three attempts by four Ph.D. students over the course of five years before Dawson’s initial Klee-UC idea turned into a published paper. Of those four students, only one “survived”—I quit the Klee project, and two others quit the Ph.D. program altogether.</i></blockquote>\r\nGuo is no Jeremiah: despite his suffering, despite his very penetrating analysis of the waste and the idiocies, he doesn't declaim the system. He just analyses the narrow, nonscientific incentives of those around him and gets on with winning the game. He talks like this: \"<i>i think that leveraging [software] and aligning with both of your interests and incentives will be the best way for me to both make a contribution and also to feel satisfied about making concrete forward progress every day.</i>”. He uses 'top-tier' without scare quotes. At one point he dispassionately notes that half a dozen of his papers were rejected because he wasn't fluent in the specific sub-field's “rhetorical tricks, newfangled buzzwords, and marketing-related contortions required to satisfy reviewers\". That is, he comes up against bullshit Bourdieuan micro-distinctions, boundary work, irrelevant to science, and shrugs and sets about learning how to pass as an insider. Look elsewhere <a href=\"https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/15/can-twitter-save-science/\">for the</a> <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/grad\">relevant</a> <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2010/12/16/the-disposable-academic\">denunciations</a>. \r\n\r\nIt would be cynical to think that he doesn't milk the politics of postgraduate pain because he landed well, is a professor now - instead just envy him his inner calm:\r\n<blockquote><i>my six years of Ph.D. training have made me wiser, savvier, grittier, and more steely, focused, creative, eloquent, perceptive, and professionally effective than I was as a fresh college graduate. (Two obvious caveats: Not every Ph.D. student received these benefits—many grew jaded and burned-out from their struggles. Also, lots of people cultivate these positive traits without going through a Ph.D. program.)... \r\nPursuing a Ph.D. has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life, and I feel extremely lucky to have been given the opportunity to be creative during this time.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nThere is this to be said for the American seven year ditch: Guo was able to suffer and wander for three entire years before he had his first big idea. That's the other side: the incredible privilege of being paid to read, paid to talk to clever people, paid to think new thoughts. But who says privileges have to feel nice, or not drive you half-mad?\r\n\r\nA very valuable warning for some tiny fraction of the world, a flat curio for some other tiny voyeur fraction.",

It's billed as (very) hard scifi, but there was actually less physics and more economics in it than I was expecting (and still too much kinematic exposition for most readers, I guess). It's \"hard\" in the sense that every technology in this already exists in some form, if only prototype or protoprototype, that every celestial body mentioned exists in that location, that the energy budget of the crew is taken seriously - \"gravity wells are for suckers\" - that their (even safety-critical) software has many terrible bugs. <spoiler>(Though I thought this was implausible:\r\n<blockquote><i>The flight suits were meant only for short, emergency EVAs, but without access to the ship's network, the clam suits' high-tech helmets were inert.\r\n</blockquote></i>)\r\nWhy not completely local processing? Why not use the lo-tech visor instead?</spoiler>\r\n\r\nThe most moving part was <spoiler>Nicole's euthanasia scene, though the anguish of Goff's stupid robots and extortion is also quite big</spoiler>. Some of the most important things in the world rely on sacrifice, and really we should be more moved by the death of an asteroid miner than that of a soldier in a typical war. One is driving the species forward, one is crab-wrestling in a bucket. \r\n\r\nWhy is space so moving? Well there's the stated reason, via Hawking:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nWith climate change, overdue asteroid strikes, epidemics, and population growth, our own planet is increasingly precarious.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nBut does this argument from reduction of existential risk go through? Probably not - most x-risk is due to us, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCfLheUxHEI\">not volcanoes or asteroids or gamma bursts</a>, and we should expect this kind of risk to reduce only modestly in a multiplanetary setting, since the act of colonisation carries the risk source, us, with it; and there are much cheaper and more developed ways of preventing extinction, like arms control and AI research. And we're (even) more likely to have large conflicts when the cultural distances, between planetary civilisations, are so much larger. \r\n\r\nSo what? Is it our genes, new-pastures wanderlust? The sheer scale? \r\n\r\nThere's a lot of ostentation in the book, unnecessary mentions of Zegna suits and fancy watches and whatnot (perhaps intended to make us suspicious of the investors and lawyers who wear them - but we already have them <i>admitting</i> that they are motivated by egomania and envy). The billionaire at the heart of the plot is a suitable mix of inspirational, reckless, authoritarian, noble, ignoble. \r\n\r\nProps to Suarez for using <a href=\"http://spaceengine.org/\">SpaceEngine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/\">Kerbal</a> to model the precise trajectory of his crew, though many extra points would have accrued had he open-sourced the run, for the purposes of scientific hermeneutics. Also for his bibliography and dissing <a href=\"https://www.space.com/21554-mars-toxic-perchlorate-chemicals.html\">Mars colonisation</a>. \r\n\r\nSuarez' claim that a single asteroid trip could make a trillion dollars is contradicted in <a href=\"http://www.weeklyweinersmith.com/?p=858\">the Weinersmith's pop book</a>, where they emphasise the legal headaches, and that the profits are conditional on a huge increase in human space activity (otherwise not much demand for your LEO wares). This is all I know, and it's not very strong evidence either way.\r\n\r\n\r\n*********************************\r\n\r\nHow does it do as Serious science fiction?\r\n\r\n<i>Social development</i>: None. One thing which doesn't happen much IRL is the <spoiler>financial <i>and</i> literal suicide mission by a billionaire for the purposes of driving humanity forward</spoiler>, but this is just ordinary audacity scaled up. I like the extrapolation of <a href=\"https://space-agency.public.lu/en.html\">Luxembourg</a>'s space industry, the ultimate colonial underwriting. The secret construction of a spaceship in HEO is implausible at the moment but <i>might</i> not be in a few decades.\r\n\r\n<i>Software development</i>: Yes! The mission is almost lost several times due to software problems, and Ade is the most critical crewmember because of his top monkeypatching and hacking skills (hacking in both senses).\r\n\r\n<i>Actual science</i>: Yes. The gravity ship is actually basic physics, just incredibly hard and expensive engineering (Joyce drops something like $45bn on the project, which sounds about right). The economic argument about moving and constructing everything outside of gravity wells seems incontrovertible to me.",

    "review": "I'm surprised to find Carver relying on punchlines - last-line narrative puns - in most of these stories. There is: a lot of rambling, a lot of meanness (breakups, fights, conversations that would be much healthier if they were honest fights), and then a transcendent or transcendently degraded last line. It would almost be not worth reading if you lost all the last lines. Here's what I mean by a pun - from 'The Calm':\r\n<blockquote><i>But today I was thinking of that place, of Crescent City, and of how I was trying out a new life there with my wife, and how, in the barber's chair that morning, I had made up my mind to go. I was thinking today about the calm I felt when I closed my eyes and let the barber's fingers move through my hair, the sweetness of those fingers, the hair already starting to grow.\r\n</blockquote></i>I expected him to care for his wretches.\r\n\r\nThe one from the wife's perspective, 'So Much Water So Close To Home' is the only standout. Completely menacing with almost no action, no flash. Good portraits of the oafish, as opposed to the rapey, as opposed to the long-suffering. I can't decide if the last line is acquiescence or perversity.\r\n\r\nThe title story is surprisingly slight, a 16-page Symposium with oddly inarticulate, repetitive drinkers. (One has ~10 years of college education, and but he's the most primitive.) You could put this down to naturalism and forget it entirely, but for its two great lines. (The story is, then, a fine thing for the protagonist of <i><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanleaf/2015/01/04/how-birdman-betrays-raymond-carver-an-untold-story/#64e140ac742c\">Birdman</a></i> to stage - self-defeating, opaque, not as deep as it wants.)\r\n\r\nStories like these live or die on dialogue, and there's neither enough heft or polish in their chat for me. I always get <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2426881729\">Chandler</a> and Carver mixed up (yeah, I know) - but if I didn't, I'd go for Chandler every time. The lowness of Chandler is Gothic, stylised, and somehow less general.\r\n\r\nPlus one star for SMWSCTH.",

    "review": "One of his darkest; darker than the one with a real hell. Stuffed full of plot, rammed full of details - a dozen cities on three planets, each with their own economic or cultural or religious setup. There's: a huge war over economic policy; a primitivist misotheist theocracy; a bunch of murderous millenarians; a group of solipsist mercenaries who each think they're the only person in the world; a World Tree ecology; a giant raft city; a talking deus ex machina; two world conspiracies; a man raised from birth to be the perfect revolutionary leader; the fall of a trillionaire dynasty; terrible, maximally vicious sibling rivalry; a beautiful android city full of likeable people being competent and deep. The protagonists pull off about a dozen missions in varied landscapes with various goals. But it's all just sketched, since the 12 worlds he builds are vying for the same 700 pages. \r\n<blockquote><i>We are a race prone to monsters, and when we produce one we worship it. What kind of world, what translation of good could come from all that's happened here?\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\nAnd I didn't like any of the protagonists; they're all a glib kind of hedonist. The leader, Sharrow, is <i>tacitly</i> remorseful about the many terrible things she does, but at no point does she stop doing them.\r\n<blockquote><i>People were always sorry... The sorrow never stopped them; it just made them feel better. And so the sorrow never stopped.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<spoiler>The dastardly ubermensch Big Bad only appears in the last 5% of the book.</spoiler>\r\n<spoiler>Killing Geis with a bullet she wouldn't have if she were more responsible is one way to justify her attitude I guess.</spoiler>\r\n<spoiler>In killing Geis, Sharrow saves the World Court, or anyway the Court/Rebel States status quo. The ending doesn't resolve anything, fine, but I was amazed that we didn't have her recovering the Gun. It's one thing to leave ambiguity about what's next, but it's not really clear what Sharrow's options are. She lost her crew, killed her family (including the son), is no longer hunted by the Huhsz, gets Feril boxed for a century, has a prosecution coming, and doesn't give a fuck about anything. But she has a cool motorbike.</spoiler>\r\n<spoiler>Bank's scifi is unusually emotionally fraught, focussed on inner life. Sharrow vs Breyguhn is very tragic and quite believable, for all that it makes me dismiss Sharrow as an impulsive heartless fool.</spoiler>\r\n\r\n* The Huhsz, the millenarians, are actually quite marginal, despite the first 200 pages setting them up to be central.\r\n* Odd portrait of a very advanced (10000 year old), fairly stable capitalism. They manage to ban things (like bioweapons), and manage to prosecute trillionaires.\r\n* Feril goes straight in the all-time gallery of Wise Cinnamon-bun AIs we don't deserve. (Along with Lt Cmd Data, Constable Dorfl, TARS, Iron Giant, GCU Grey Area, Wall-E).\r\n* I didn't buy the superior ancient tech thing, here. Golter has a mostly-functional academic and state apparatus, and is able to do many things we can't; it's implausible that they wouldn't manage to reverse-engineer things over thousands of years\r\n* Nice echoing of the Solipsists in Sharrow at the end:\r\n<blockquote><i>The blood pumped and coursed within her, and with each beat the whole edifice seemed to quake and pulse and shiver, as though for all its mountainous solidity the Sea House was merely a projection, something held in the power of her blood-quickened eyes.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n* The Lazy Guns sound exactly like Culture tech, quasi-sentient to boot. But their presence in this remote \"orphan\" system is odd, and it doesn't fit to have the Culture either dump or lose such weapons.\r\n\r\nBanks is less subtle than I thought he was, as a teen. Good if you prefer worlds to characters.",

    "review": "What is it to be Jane Austen for dudes?* There’s the boring meaning: “set in 1700s”, or “full of circumlocution”. Or the interesting: “depicting old fun, old morals, matters of grave importance (marriage, war) with irony and humour, status regulation, the sheer work of getting along with others”. explosions, to boot.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nThe seamen, sprawling abroad on the fo’c’sle and combing out their long hair or plaiting it up again for one another, kindly explained to the landmen that this long swell from the south and east, this strange sticky heat that came both from the sky and the glassy surface of the heaving sea, and this horribly threatening appearance of the sun, meant that there was to be a coming dissolution of all natural bonds, an apocalyptic upheaval, a right dirty night.\r\n</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBrutal, too. The jolly crew, so kind and deferential to Stephen, are invariably wasted and criminal on shore (“<i>the Sophies were much given to rapine</i>”) And the heroic, witty, sensitive officers are pretty bloodthirsty (“<i>burning for the uproar and the more than human liberation of a battle</i>”). That’s what you get when you hire or abduct a hundred killers and pen them in with 2 pints of rum a day.\r\n\r\nProse is curious: both smooth and obscure. But he’s a master all right.\r\n<blockquote><i>Stephen could remember an evening when he had sat there in the warm, deepening twilight, watching the sea; it had barely a ruffle on its surface, and yet the Sophie picked up enough moving air with her topgallants to draw a long straight whispering furrow across the water, a line brilliant with unearthly phosphorescence, visible for quarter of a mile behind her. Days and nights of unbelievable purity. Nights when the steady Ionian breeze rounded the square mainsail – not a brace to be touched, watch relieving watch – and he and Jack on deck, sawing away, sawing away, lost in their music, until the falling dew untuned their strings. And days when the perfection of dawn was so great, the emptiness so entire, that men were almost afraid to speak.\r\n</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>“It seems to me that the greater mass of confusion and distress must arise from these less evident divergencies – the moral law, the civil, military, common laws, the code of honour, custom, the rules of practical life, of civility, of amorous conversation, gallantry, to say nothing of Christianity for those that practise it. All sometimes, indeed generally, at variance; none ever in an entirely harmonious relation to the rest; and a man is perpetually required to choose one rather than another, perhaps (in his particular case) its contrary. It is as though our strings were each tuned according to a completely separate system – it is as though the poor ass were surrounded by four and twenty mangers”\r\n</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nPeople are in it for Jack and Stephen. JA is a big kind lunk, thinks he’s wittier than he is. On deciding to test out his new cannon:\r\n<blockquote><i>“I think we can have a couple of rounds: God knows how long these charges have been lying in the guns. Besides,’ he added in a voice within his inner voice – a voice from a far deeper level, ‘think of the lovely smell.”\r\n</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>“I have been thinking about Dillon all day. All day long I have been thinking about him, off and on. You would scarcely credit how much I miss him... Dillon was Irish. Though you would never have thought so – never to be seen drunk, almost never called anyone out, spoke like a Christian, the most gentleman-like creature in the world, nothing of the hector at all – oh Christ. My dear fellow, my dear Maturin, I do beg your pardon. I say these damned things … I regret it extremely.”\r\n</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSM is a cool moody Irish intellectual, quick with a bonesaw, and actually witty.\r\n<blockquote><i>“The thing is officially called the trial of the captain, officers and ship’s company...; but obviously in this it is only my conduct that is in question. You have nothing to worry about, I do assure you, upon my word and honour. Nothing at all.’\r\n‘Oh, I shall plead guilty at once,’ said Stephen. ‘And I shall add that I was sitting in the powder-magazine with a naked light at the time, imagining the death of the King, wasting my medical stores, smoking tobacco and making a fraudulent return of the portable soup. What solemn nonsense it is’ – laughing heartily... After a longish pause Jack said, ‘You do not rate post-captains and admirals very high among intelligent beings, I believe? I have heard you say some tolerably severe things about admirals, and great men.’\r\n“Why, to be sure, something sad seems to happen to your great men and your admirals, with age, pretty often: even to your post-captains. A kind of atrophy, a withering-away of the head and the heart. I conceive it may arise from…”\r\n</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAlmost every page at sea has some new jargon, most of it lovely. You will need <a href=\"http://wiki.hmssurprise.org/phase3/index.php/Category:Guide_for_the_Perplexed:All_Articles\">this</a>, even though some things are explained to landmen. O’Brian is intentionally making it difficult for us, so skip him if you don’t consent to an old snob messing with you.\r\n<blockquote><i>“And then these futtock-plates at the rim here hold the dead-eyes for the topmast shrouds – the top gives a wide base so that the shrouds have a purchase: the top is a little over ten foot wide. It is the same thing up above. There are the cross-trees, and they spread the topgallant shrouds. You see them, sir? Up there, where the look-out is perched, beyond the topsail yard.’\r\n‘You could not explain this maze of ropes and wood and canvas without using sea-terms, I suppose. No, it would not be possible.’\r\n‘Using no sea-terms? I should be puzzled to do that, sir”\r\n</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nO’Brian goes onto my very short list of novelists who can write a philosopher character without accidentally making them a guru or a pseud. (Joyce, St Aubyn, Borges, Bolaño, Stoppard, Egan)\r\n\r\n* Austen is for everyone, but not everyone knows that.",

This is true whether we want it to be or not... Whereas previously our physical strength determined how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed, it now merely determines how well we function in these new surroundings we have crafted for ourselves as our culture has accumulated. But we are still animals – our physical existence is, in the final analysis, the only one that actually matters. A weak man is not as happy as that same man would be if he were strong. This reality is offensive to some people who would like the intellectual or spiritual to take precedence. It is instructive to see what happens to these very people as their squat strength goes up.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nA salvo(!) This message is repulsive, unjust, and almost exactly fits my experience. (Though he is being imprecise: better to say \"the most important foundation\", a key instrument rather than the highest terminus. Though even then it's not \"most important\", since it neglects an even larger nonintellectual effect on my philosophy of life, love.)  I was once a very unhappy young man with a tragicomic existential view - and so many fixable, concrete, absurdly powerful options, <i>absurdly unknown to me</i>. The lifter is Sisyphus, happy. Weights are a strong psychological intervention, perhaps the third-strongest for me.\r\n\r\nLots of reasoning from first principles, which is satisfying and gives it an Athenian air, but which I can just barely evaluate. Luckily it is just so easy to check if he's right (for your case).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fzQ33Gvz9-9jX5uv6XDiBjpDsjX9bmxfihqe_7Bo2inj0q2V7Kr-DVWDEURCwCY50HSXmD2HeHl5CHUfhl2ALf2pxW0eX8bwXnL4VhYwEK3SodbAXrnZjKzm5Ba0uli-5k9GctY4uyWg6JKb2B8Ver8iMkUiZeeVStWfD7tUl1pIj6i8z2x8wPX4A8Z6tc4YblSj3r53fFNkcCUyZn5xYiIqY5Wka1JMxAO7_tuuxt1nZWSn8luFkgKlsmW5Fqsud3qg2yS_06KAOuNuSChyFwbG9gAFGyyNZvX9lsvGagnhS-e3zx-7MsoKrNJFsL83PHS_8vJcG-HiAOiuYMihLY3x_JkrljGXpLEC5I-k8xGhF4zydg55ohnQvWG6r9rTmSac3pj8lHAff5ezNS2eozHx0HzR9kjPcBznih6DEkQV6W7xZkKffiadL6t7Qe4Hj13XXjKpqezG5FNMKHokfG2DlzaPiL4EGeN1tQXlVofFPV_RbNOe5W96nh9iV0YnDPjvUBVYwfQhT3-xMt050a-QDXQCVq7oR3EAkWIT-KB3F3ZG32Hj3NNIb0usDPMISKMewuAg_56DhSqo4-mqd2kFEYD7w752PK2HMMcDZRbduyGW7P3BBHOX-TJ3PpKyAxhBLzBmMNdZq5QoVII1qd6WQhRGVu9YXfl9JkueFZ5FCj9QEzBNytYe6w--a968CeM2LP7WDuUeLJdWqtU0Bk8j6xOE5ltT-yBSMZaARyw8vUA\" />\r\n<blockquote><i>The force of gravity acting on the bar is always acting straight down in a vertical line. Therefore, the most efficient way to oppose this force is by acting on it vertically as well. So not only is a straight line the shortest distance between two points, but a straight vertical line is also the most efficient bar path for a barbell moving through space in a gravitational framework.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Your bench press strength doesn’t adapt to the total number of times you’ve been to the gym to bench or to your sincerest hope that it will get stronger. It adapts to the stress imposed on it by the work done with the barbell. Furthermore, it adapts to exactly the kind of stress imposed on it. If you do sets of 20, you get good at doing 20s. If you do heavy singles, you get better at doing those.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>“good technique” in barbell training is easily and understandably defined as the ability of the lifter to keep the bar vertically aligned with the balance point.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n\r\nRippetoe is the source of the recent renaissance in cheap simple barbells (dozens of muscles recruited at once) over circuits of giant single-muscle machines. He tells a plausibly mean story about the economic perverse incentives that led to the latter, 1980-2010.\r\n\r\nThere is too much detail here - he discusses variants of the movements and the debate over them. But what a trivial criticism that is! I think most people could skip two-thirds of the book, since there's detailed kinematics for each move, instructor tips and gym-building tips, but it's interesting throughout. You could get the key parts from the final Programme section, then the \"what not to do\" chapter closing sheets. Warm-up sets chapter was very useful.\r\n<blockquote><i>if your schedule does not allow time for proper warm-up, it does not allow time for training at all... [The squat] should be carefully and thoroughly prepared with a couple of empty-bar sets, and then as many as five sets between those and the work sets.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nThere's an abrupt shift in tone, in the chapter on lifting for kids: he starts citing University press books and listing comparative numbers for his claims. So this is a crusade for him.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that you'd learn form from this alone, even like reading it and applying it live with a mirror. It is unlikely that you could find a PT with this much physical knowledge or clarity.\r\n\r\nHe's quite bitchy, which I like but you might not:\r\n<blockquote><i>if you continually miss workouts, you are not actually training, and your obviously valuable time should be spent more productively elsewhere.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nIf you're not increasing your weight, you're not training, and so not following his programme. The obsession with increase is still not mine. Strength, yes, exertion yes, but constant expansion? I aim for 100kg squat, and expect to attain it this year. <i>Not</i> herniating weight, not kneecapping weight, not sclerotic weight: nice big weight. Maybe once I get there I will grow bored, will again be confounded by the power of concrete body on worldview, and have to start climbing again. He thinks everyone gets injured eventually. But is this under the permanent revolution programme?\r\n<blockquote><i>Ambition is useful, greed is not. Most of human history and the science of economics demonstrate that the desire for more than is currently possessed drives improvement, both personally and for societies. But greed is an ugly thing when uncontrolled and untempered with wisdom, and it will result in your program’s progress coming to an ass-grinding halt.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>you’re a little fluffy around the belly, you have obviously already created the conditions necessary for growth. You’ll usually start out stronger than the skinny guy, and because your body hasn’t got the problems with growing that skinny guys do, strength gains can come more easily for you if you eat correctly.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\nI've been doing a derivative of this program since October, no trainer, lots of missed sessions, just the primary exercises, 1 hour and out, a scaled-up ordinary diet, and saw decent gains, +50kg onto my initial squat. Rippetoe claims that this could be achieved in half the time with many gallons of milk and much more aggro, and I see no reason to doubt this.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<b>Philosophical aspects of lifting</b>:\r\n\r\n* As above: The body helps determine the mind. You should be wary of your own philosophy, not just because of your local social conditioning, but also because of your diet, your habits, your daily kindness, and your bench. The lifter is Sisyphus, happy.\r\n\r\n* No excuses, no wiggle room, no ambiguity: lifting a lot without injuring yourself is a brute fact, unbiased. Rippetoe: \"<i>cause and effect cannot be argued with or circumvented by your wishes and desires.</i>\"\r\n\r\n* 'He's a growing <a href=\"https://dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/loun\">loon</a>!' my granny would say, justifying my early gluttony. Well, twenty years later here I am again, a growing boy. Artificial growth, body neoteny. What does a sense of increase, of coming potential, do to you?\r\n\r\n* <blockquote><i>\"Waiting until soreness subsides before doing the next workout is a good way to guarantee that soreness will be produced every time, since you’ll never get adapted to sufficient workload frequency to stop getting sore.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* There are so many ways to do it wrong. (Only some of those wrong ways break you - the others just slow you down or confuse your body.) Rippetoe focusses on five movements, out of however many thousand physiologically possible ones. These are picked for excellent reasons, tested over decades.\r\n\r\n* <blockquote><i>Exercise is the thing we must do to replicate the conditions under which our physiology was – and still is – adapted, the conditions under which we are physically normal. In other words, exercise is substitute caveman activity, the thing we need to make our bodies, and in fact our minds, normal in the 21st century.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* <blockquote><i>Psychologically, 20 [rep max] work is very hard, due to the pain, and lifters who are good at it develop the ability to displace themselves from the situation during the set. Or they just get very tough.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n* I live in my head. But the hip drive out of a deep squat is such a strong strange confluence of forces, vaguely under my control but more accurately an explosion I light the fuse on, that I am driven to notice and appreciate neuromuscular marvels.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<i>Book epistemic status</i>: Decades of personal experience plus strong amateur theory plus distilled folk wisdom, in a domain with rapid and unambiguous feedback. He's quite open about unknown things, e.g. the molecular nature of soreness. Sometimes a little defensive, against experts less near to the metal. Sample:\r\n<blockquote><i>Most sources within the heavy-training community agree that a good starting place is one gram of protein per pound of bodyweight per day, with the rest of the diet making up 3500–6000 calories, depending on training requirements and body composition. Although these numbers produce much eyebrow-raising and cautionary statement-issuing from the registered-dietetics people, it is a fact that these numbers work well for the vast majority of people who lift weights, and these numbers have worked well for decades.</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<i>Why trust my opinion at all?</i> I've followed <a href=\"https://stronglifts.com/\">Rippetoe's programme</a> inconsistently for 4 months and still got good returns - worth it for mental health alone. I know sophomore biology and physics, and nothing he says here contradicts any of it.",

No matter how changed, how corrupted the world is, <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20210224101549/https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1%2AYjnB78GcegfPDQOpvfwciA.png\">it is still alive</a>, full of possibility.

    "review": "Top shelf mind candy. There are several sides to 40k: the original indie English lulz, the corporate grimdark edginess which misses the irony, and then what the few real writers make of it. (Ian Watson and Abnett are two I know about.)\r\n\r\nThe first 150 pages here have no giant robots, only the quiet apprehensive horror of a war economy, war emotions. Lovers parted by conscription, blocks of lives traded for nothing, the belligerent joy of a public which hasn't lost its first battle yet. Then you get plenty of omnipotent bots, a conspiracy, and two parties in desperate retreat.\r\n\r\nI like the Mechanicus because, unlike the rest of their society they are half-rational, occasionally have to confront the pervasive superstition and noble lies.\r\n\r\nSeveral times you get a unique twist on PTSD, from old men who spent decades inhabiting a war machine:\r\n<blockquote><i>Zink hobbled over to his hut at the best full stride his old legs could manage. He took out the worn step ladder that he used for pruning the boughs of the ploin trees, and carried it back to the west wall. This execution took the best part of half an hour, and Zink had to stop and catch his breath twice. More than twice, he forgot what he was about and began to carry the ladder back to the hut. When he reached the wall, he came about, two points, low stride, west rotation, and dragged the ladder into the wet flowerbeds.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nI struggle a bit with the psychology of the wicked Satanic enemy. Even in thoughtful authors like Abnett their motivations and strategies are too predictably vicious, too unsustainable - they've invaded this planet, fine, but then they blow up half the cities in it. So what's the point of invading?\r\n<blockquote><i>The archenemy, in his long experience, often ignored \r\ntactical logic or strategic merit, but this was an odd choice even by the archenemy’s perverse standards.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAn enemy who was so haphazard, divided, unstrategic would struggle to threaten a whole organised empire. They could just be terrorists, or value suffering itself, or just be damaging infrastructure for the wider conflict. But this is a flat worldview, one you can't do anything with except backdrop the nobility of your own characters. Which is one reason there's not a lot of literature in this canon. Abnett compensates well as usual, with flawed and distinctive protagonists, rigorous fantasy logistics and tactics, nice setpieces, plenty of humanising nonmilitary detail, and good satisfying betrayals.",

    "review": "A good book about maximally important ideas. She invites various technical experts to write some info boxes about mathematical matters, which is extremely admirable since the meat of Ramsey is all in the maths and the logic. <a href=\"https://www.gleech.org/frank\">Here's an essay with my gushing thoughts on his work.</a>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>We can evaluate the various outlooks on life and see which have the best consequences. In his assessment, the key to meaning in life is to be optimistic, thrilled, and actively try to improve conditions for people now and in the future. Live as fully and as ethically as you can, was his conclusion. Ramsey understood that inequalities get in the way of being thrilled by life. He put much effort into trying to make the world a fairer place. He also understood that individuals’ psychological makeups have an impact on whether one is depressed or not. His own tendency was to be cheerful—he was remembered as always smiling and looking rather pleased, not so much with himself but with things in general. He knew that Wittgenstein was not so disposed. But Ramsey too had periods of crippling anguish, and he thought that one should try to improve one’s life by engaging with what clinical psychology has to offer and by trying to be happy. If psychology can help change our outlook for the better, we should avail ourselves of it, as he had.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n* I only spotted Misak being fatuous once, taking the usual liberty where philosophers speak shit about utilitarianism as if it was for idiots:\r\n<blockquote><i>Ramsey was not a full-out utilitarian, to whom discounting is the obvious and correct thing to do.</i></blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/temporal-discounting\">-_-</a> uh huh.\r\n\r\n* How bloody erotic the (defiance of the) old morality seems from my safe remove. If you're caught you lose your job, like <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2016/06/it-s-unfashionable-call-someone-genius-william-empson-was-one\">Empson</a>, fired for owning condoms.\r\n\r\n* It is tragic that he wasted months of his life (2% of it) with Freudians who were unfit to treat him -- among all people they were unfit to treat. Misak repeatedly refers to Frank being 'cured' by them. This seems inapt: at the time of the analysis, he was physically distant from his forbidden crush for 6 months and was forbidden from writing to her. Seems enough to get over it! Talking to the funny Austrian was just sauce. Maybe.\r\n<blockquote><i>He also suggested to Frank that he had an Oedipus fixation, drawing on the Freudian contention that every son wants to kill his father so that he can have sex with his mother. Glover told Frank to have a talk with Margaret, and that seems to have helped: ‘I did and she was awfully nice.’ But his three months or so with Glover were on the whole not working: ‘It wasn’t really improving my mind very much, so I decided to stop it and go back to sea.’ Margaret too was being psychoanalysed, by Dr James Glover, the brother of Frank’s therapist. James Glover was also psychoanalysing Dick and Geoff. Their analysts had no qualms about discussing a patient’s analysis not only amongst themselves, but also with other patients.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>[Wittgenstein] had never before said of anyone that they had understood the [Tractatus]  and, as far as I know, he would never say it again.</i></blockquote> \r\n\r\n\r\nThe book is another reminder of Wittgenstein's cruelty and shallowness. But his mistakes were emotionally rich, and so we keep talking about him. I cannot forgive Wittgenstein's obituary for Ramsey:\r\n<blockquote><i>Ramsey’s mind repulsed me. When I came to Cambridge months ago I thought that I would not be able to have dealings with him, for I had such unpleasant memories of\r\nhim from our meeting  years ago with Keynes in Sussex... I could communicate quite well with\r\nR. about some things. But in the course of time it did not really go well, after all. R’s incapacity for genuine enthusiasm or genuine reverence, which is the same, finally repulsed me more & more... his criticism didn’t help along but held back and sobered... one labored arduously for a long time in vain to explain something to him until he suddenly shrugged his shoulders about it & said this was self-evident... He had an ugly mind. But not an ugly soul. He truly relished music & with understanding. And one could see by looking at him what effect it had on him. Of the last movement of one of Beethoven’s last quartets, a movement he loved perhaps more than anything else, he told me that it made him feel as if the heavens were open.</i></blockquote>\r\nOr this\r\n<blockquote><i>Frank’s sisters remembered that he wrote a terrible letter to their father, saying that Arthur had failed to get Frank proper medical treatment and so was responsible for his death. The gratuitous cruelty leaves one aghast. Wittgenstein was notoriously and severely self-critical. But he seems not to have understood that extending his brand of moral self-criticism to others was itself not very moral.</i></blockquote>\r\nThis surprised me though: on the death-bed he told jokes, with either reading (agitation or kind deflection) uncharacteristic of him:\r\n<blockquote><i>Frances said that it was clear that Wittgenstein shared with her both an immense personal sadness, as well as sympathy for Lettice. But he made poor and flippant jokes, perhaps to disguise emotions he couldn’t cope with, or perhaps to help Lettice keep her composure.</i></blockquote>\r\n",

Portentous in all but five cases, mostly clumsily so. Glorifying bad decisions just because they are autonomous. Sprinkling of non-English languages, otherwise less knowledge than I look for. Good amount of very bad poetry too.\n\nI'd have stopped reading this about a quarter through, but I was looking for new writers. I figured that if Tor snagged Egan, Abercrombie, Miéville, Reynolds, Stross, surely some of the other 22 authors, chosen from presumed thousands, would be good. 3 are (Larson, Tidbeck and Kemper), but this knowledge cost me more than I thought.\n\n<b>Great</b>\n1. “<a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2019/09/25/zeitgeber-greg-egan/\">Zeitgeber</a>” by Greg Egan\n2. “<a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2019/04/10/painless-rich-larson/\">Painless”</a> by Rich Larson\n\n<b>Ok</b>:\n3. “<a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2019/01/14/karin-tidbeck-the-last-voyage-of-skidbladnir/\">The Last Voyage of Skidbladnir</a>” by Karin Tidbeck\n4. “<a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2019/02/13/the-song-erinn-kemper/\">The Song</a>” by Erinn L.

Really nice. Dozens of original details. I liked the recycling replicator, feeding a stray your fingers, the Arabic-Hausa neologisms, procedural cartoons, dying face unlock. I flinched for the CIPA characters even though it means nothing to them.\n\n<i>The Song</i>, Erinn Kemper. Plenty of tension and ambiguity, unlike the other stories. Say you work on a machine that kills the creatures you love, because that's how you get to study them alive. Characters with more than one value, making terrible decisions, not solving problems, not quipping, not punching up. The setup relies on you thinking there's a difference in kind between killing a whale and killing a cow, which I don't. There's even a dig at monomaniacal Greens: \"<i>the carbon footprint resulting from eating whale meat is substantially lower than that of beef</i>(...)\" Works.\n\n“Blue Morphos in the Garden” by Lis Mitchell. Playful sort of death, natural afterlife. I am glad the protagonist pushes back against the ancestor-worship and collective subsumption. \n<blockquote><i>\"Don't you think it’s selfish not to leave something that Lily can see, that she can tell her children about?”\n“Don’t you think it’s a bit much to expect me to define my entire life by my motherhood and the expectation that my daughter will want me around forever?\"\n</blockquote></i>\n\n\n“Water: A History” by KJ Kabza. romance vs economics. Still touched by the blind contrarian spirit of this volume, but at least it's well done.\n\n“Skinner Box” by Carole Johnstone. Trapped in a tiny spaceship with your lover and your rapist. Angsty astronauts, too horny and sadistic to live. You can't send people this fucked up into space. But we will. Narrator is called a genius but shows no signs of it. Johnstone manages to make deep learning nasty, just by associating it with these mean narrow bastards. Nice mention of Graphcore, my local overweening tech giant.\n<blockquote><i>\"I don’t like the unpredictability of people. Of neocortexes. But I hate the predictability of nanites.

Warzone children scene manipulative, saccharine. At least she's thinking big, Santa Superintelligence / Surveill. Boy and god. AI unbixes itself and everything goes swell. Attempt at lyrical Uplift mandala but ends up clumsy and soppy-stern.\ncould their imagined trajectories be any worse than our increasing totalitarianism? Or any worse than one of the main hallmarks of what it means to be human, which is to kill our fellows, or even send our own kin to torture or death if a certain “belief”—whatever a belief might be, neurochemically speaking—has taken up residence in our unfathomable brains?\nBring it on, I say. The change might be for the better.\n\n“Seonag and the Seawolves” by M. Evan MacGriogair. Nice Celtic colour and rhythm, though actually it gets in the way of the images. The Gaelic is mostly not translated, and I didn't bother to google it. Portentous as usual, far too many one-sentence paragraphs, but it does islander prejudice and peaty magic well.\n\n\"Old Media\" by Annalee Newitz. Central conceit - that we would have economically-profitable human slavery at the same time as human-level AI - is full-on nonsense, but I actually didn't mind much. Goofy picture of a future humanities degree, studying harem anime and anti-robotism with your ace robot gf. <blockquote><i>She [robot gf] looked so beautiful that John thought his heart would crack open like the space eggs in a kaiju movie, full of lava and lightning and life forms that had never walked the Earth. </blockquote></i>\n\n“More Real Than Him” by Silvia Park. Protagonist is a basic K-pop stan and a sexist haxxor snob. (Hard to imagine such being technically talented, but some surely are.) Fun.\n\n\n“The Hundredth House Had No Walls” by Laurie Penny. Extremely conventional subversion of fairy tales, the princess saves herself in this one eh. Flat and clear and fine.\n\n\"Beyond the El\" by John Chu. Maudlin food magic. Few outright errors, as well as an apparently intentional hypernegation tic (\"aren't not exactly rich\", \"the wind was not freezing\"). Sister character is a boring 2D sociopath.\n\n“As the Last I May Know” by S. L. Huang. Nuclear Omelas. Contains a dreadful slander on Otto Hahn, naming the warmonger nuke-happy president after him. Dreadful haiku. I'd have liked some details on how exactly they kept their nuclear secrets for 200 years; we didn't manage two. The story hinges on a false dichotomy, that the superweapon will necessarily kill children. Unless it's a very dense population, or the enemy are using hostages, then she doesn't explain why there's no tactical use.\n\n“Deriving Life” by Elizabeth Bear. Incredibly glib, replacing the rightful defamiliarisation and mirror-darkly of SF with applause lights (\"<i>Can you imagine a planet full of assholes who used to just . . . cut down trees?</i>\") Premise is bizarre and cool and she doesn't pull it off.\n\n“Articulated Restraint” by Mary Robinette Kowal. <i>Really</i> irritating. Why do people glorify going to space when you're physically messed up? I guess this would be less pointless if you liked the character from elsewhere. I guess the actual Apollo equipment protocol details are nice.\n\n\nWould be one star without the Egan, Larson, Tidbeck, Kemper 3-stars.",

    "review": "It's impossible to be the Darnielle completist I am. On top of the maybe 400 commercial objects (\"<i>8 to 20 On a Weapons Charge is a bonus track from ~1 copy of Taking the Dative</i>\"), there are: a complete but unreleased album, three dozen online-only ephemeral downloads, a hundred covers, a hundred live-only bootleg-only songs, a hundred more known \"<a href=\"https://themountaingoats.fandom.com/wiki/Unreleased_and_Unofficially-Released_Songs\">missing</a>\" songs, dozens of songs with no attestation but a title <a href=\"http://www.themountaingoats.net/lyrics/extras_lyr.html\">or a verse</a>, and who knows how many more we couldn't snatch from him out of the air. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HttPrN3v1go\">Some of his best</a> have been performed exactly once, and probably never again.\r\n\r\nThere's two good strong pages of JD here, plus his hand in picking and ordering some really ordinary student poetry. It's <i>sort of</i> nice that it's so ordinary; if the bar were higher it would leave people behind, and poetry is now the last place to leave anyone behind. (Except the reader.) It's <i>sort of</i> terrible that the ordinary student art in here will attend much greater success, commanding heights, just because it is in here.\r\n\r\nScott Annett's '<a href=\"http://scottannett.com/cranes/\">Cranes</a>' is quite nice. Alexander Freer's 'Preliminary Communication' is an unsuccessful attempt at my favourite, difficult sort of poem, the bipartite-contrasted-abstract+concrete thingy, more than three words to a line. Felt nothing for the photos.\r\n\r\nI was a student writer, in fact more of a student writer than a student. What makes student writing? Earnestness, of course, and the attendant humour gap. An excess of night, nakedness, ribs, blood, pain, the word \"fucking\" but not much fucking. Syntax shortage. Sensual tongue effects without sensible teeth. Formulas hidden behind frantic formal experiment and pique. Derivativeness as homage. Either sensitive outsiderdom or cartoonish total radicalism or both. \r\n\r\nIt's hard to imagine that student writers could get over themselves, could become less clumsy, could settle into themselves, could understand others, could try to actually affect the world. But apparently some do, like Darnielle.",

Every one of these produced an effect in me, from deep grimace to snort to total pathos. It took me a month to read 18 stories, because it is stressful to encounter characters this vivid in scenarios this brutal.* Every story has an actual logic - often a fantastical one, like the retrocausal literally-hypothetical boddhisatva posthumans of 'Eugene'. He has few peers in thinking this hard and making you feel the thought. What <i>Black Mirror</i> could have been: thought experiments like self-aware spears.\r\n\r\nRanking:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Hundred-Light-Year Diary</li>\r\n<li>The Moral Virologist.

(I tested this <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3169323827\">here</a>; Egan's entry, weak for him, was still the best in the collection. It would be last, here.)\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\ndoing whatever it was designed to do. Enabling multiple orgasms of the left kneecap.

(Gaining the Amish disapproval of technology this way apparently posed no problem; virtually every religious implant enabled the user to embrace far stranger contradictions.) There was even an implant called Secular Humanist (‘You WILL hold these truths to be self-evident!’). No Vacillating Agnostic,  though; apparently there was no market for doubt.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nI could write something about each of these; sometimes hundreds of words. Next time.\r\n\r\n* It is probably best to treat this book as 2 or 3 small collections, for savouring and emotional rest.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does it do as serious science fiction?\r\n\r\n<i>Social development</i>: A great deal. Personal identity is twisted and torn a dozen times, and he sketches the social structures which would have to arise when there are two of you, none of you, half of you, chimeras. The Ndoli devices illustrate that social consensus <i>replaces</i> philosophy for most people. When perfect cloning and brain transplants are available - when medicine's grasp over injury is total - he still brings it back to hard economics, the small print. Better on this than Chiang, his great peer.\r\n\r\n<i>Software development</i>: Not a huge amount but enough. He knows that brain transplants couldn't work without software, and the Ndoli devices are an excellent picture of machine learning, even 25 years later, after the field became more than a toy.\r\n\r\n<i>Actual Science</i>: Half of these stem from an extrapolation of current science (transplants, brain editing, cloning, brain emulation, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioArt\">BioArt</a>), rather than say the apriori thought experiments of Chiang. And not just science: combinatorics! Actual probability! But even his flights of fancy (like the programmable wormhole with bizarre physics of 'Into Darkness') are internally consistent, and display serious attempt to take physics or biology seriously.",

    "review": "A beautiful thing. Humorous, careful, with plenty of depth just under the surface.\r\n\r\nIt gives only the classical view, only the point estimate bit, only normal utility theory.  If you are comfortable with formalism it is too slow. But it connects logic and probability and decision in the appropriately deep way. I didn't get any decision theory in philosophy class. Even in my economics classes Rational Choice was presented as a done deal, not argued for on the bedrock of expected value and Bayes. And it was a theoretical curio, not really for personal consumption.\r\n\r\nThis part of philosophy still gives me hope and awe - the hacker's end of formal/information-theoretic/Bayesian <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/michaeltitelbaum/book/TitelbaumFBEfulldraft.pdf\">epistemology</a> <a href=\"https://richardpettigrew.com/papers/\">and</a> '<a href=\"https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/g/Glymour:Clark.html\">science</a>. The common thread is paying such close attention to maths and science that they begin to fade into it. Weisberg goes as far as some open questions, like probabilistic abduction and Bertrand's paradox. (It is important to show newbies more than just the finished part of the building.)\r\n\r\nI was looking for a better absolute introduction than Tomassi or Hacking, and found it. Insofar as understanding probability is critical to patching the most common human errors, and insofar as stats is one of the few general thinking tools that really does reliably transfer out of the classroom, this is a vital thing for anyone who wants to think. Insofar as you presently think only in words this is the best object I know.\r\n\r\nMinus a half for no solution book for the end-of-chapter exercises. (I know why, but still.)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://jonathanweisberg.org/vip/\">Free here</a>",

    "review": "Quite shallow. He uses himself and Carl Jung as exemplars of the method - \"I published 4 books in 10 years\" and so on - but why should I judge either of them to have made a positive impact, merely because they published a lot? \r\n\r\nLots of cherry-picked anecdotes in the normal bad self-help mode, with no attention to <a href=\"https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/\">survivorship bias</a>. <i>Deep Work</i> has the same feel as the disgraced <a href=\"https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/\"><i>Why We Sleep</i></a>: empirically sloppy exaggeration of a plausibly ultra-important topic. Unlike Walker, Newport is not explicitly claiming scientific authority though.\r\n\r\nThe topic is networked technology as a force against individual productivity. There's a weak and a strong form:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><i>Weak</i>: \"You need to focus to do great work, or to learn new hard things. And work on the Internet is extremely vulnerable to distraction and tends to be less focussed.\"</li><br>\r\n\r\n<li><i>Strong</i>: \"The always-on fragmentary state of being caused by addictive technology is <i>disabling</i>. It has lasting developmental effects, reducing your attention span, serenity, perspective.\" (Lanier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/11/shallows-internet-changing-way-think\">Carr</a>.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nNewport makes both claims (\"<i>Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work.</i>\"), and the strong one is poorly justified to say the least. But the weak form is plausible and important enough on its own.\r\n\r\nI wondered how much this was just a rehash of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\">Flow</a> idea, and in fact Newport does give it its due. It seems fair to update the idea after 40 great years of tech and the culture of tech. (I had no mobile phone until I was 17, no smartphone until I was 27. My abstinence would be much harder now.)\r\n\r\nThe weak evidence could be forgiven if the claims were weaker, or if the tone was less pompous. Plus two stars for being about an important possibility, minus one for being unrigorous, minus one for tone.\r\n\r\nThings I try to do:\r\n\r\n* Track your amount of deep work hours every day.<br>\r\n* Protect your morning: get out of bed quickly and don't browse.<br>\r\n* Do \"time blocking\", earmarking a whole day for focused work<br>\r\n* Batch shallow work (emails, meetings) in one time slots, probably the evening.\r\n* Leave your phone in a different room. \r\n\r\nHe talks about scheduling your entire day, which I suspect is perverse. And \"become hard to reach\" is only possible for people who are already successful / in particular careers. ymmv.",

'Profiling' (the falseness of bureaucracy)\r\n4. 'Randy old bastard' (all love is God's love)\r\n5. 'Three friendships' (there are burdens we welcome which would be too cruel as punishment)\r\n6. 'A breakup breaks down' (silent ineffectual rampage; the sheer power of cowardice)\r\n7. 'Three families' (there are indignities we inflict which could not be earned) \r\n8. 'James, Alison & Gwen' (the many splendours)\r\n9. 'On Camberwell Green' (the pain of previous joy, why we cannot speak to those we have spoken a certain amount with)\r\n10. 'A romance' (the indefatigibility of the voyeur)\r\n11. 'An English rose' (autobiography as personal pornography)\r\n12. 'High' (artists aren't more mad, it's just that working from home lets you be)\r\n13. 'A minor betrayal' (the shock of youth, and youth's generosity)\r\n14. 'Back home' (the awkwardly unfilial, the old skin shed)\r\n15. 'Playing Silly Buggers' (awful youth, boring luxury, exciting responsibility)\r\n16. 'Wine and dine' (the unbearable lightness of customer service)\r\n17. 'Badge' (the powerful relics and total mysticism of childhood)\r\n18. 'After the autumn ball' (the outside view on insides)\r\n19. 'Hate' (the beam in thine own eye)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt contains the sequel to the novella 'Wankers', but has many more wankers in it. Lots and lots of charming Scottish girls as well though. Very close detail of many kinds of sexuality (the swaggering pan, the indifferently repressed, the hateful, the sweet and preconscious, the hopeless, the plugged or extinct volcano).",

Even where it is obvious that a betrayal will take place, he still manages to make me tense and outraged over it.\r\n* Emphasising how important software is to the future. A revolt occurs partially because of the elites resenting the loss of their fancy interfaces, refusing to dirty their hands with low-level programming.\r\n\r\nThe book feels very incomplete, even setting aside the cliffhanger; we see Timor's burgeoning hacking skills, but are shown none of their fruit. We see <spoiler>Geri</spoiler> tortured but not why, or why <spoiler>Tycoon</spoiler> was fine with it. <spoiler>We see Nevil's despotism take root but don't see any of his comeuppance.</spoiler> Some of this might show up in the much delayed sequel idk.",

    "review": "Wonderful introduction to meta-science. I've been <a href=\"https://www.gleech.org/psych\">obsessively tracking</a> bad science since I was a teen, and I still learned loads of new examples. (Remember that time NASA falsely declared the discovery of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFAJ-1\">an unprecedented lifeform</a>? Remember that time the best university in Sweden <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/08/update-karolinska-institute-clears-trachea-surgeon-misconduct-charges\">completely cleared</a> their murderously fraudulent surgeon?)\n\nScience has gotten a bit <a href=\"http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2017/03/academia-is-fucked-up-so-why-isnt.html\">fucked up</a>. But at least we know about it, and at least it's the one institution that has a means and a track record of unfucking itself.\n\nRitchie is a master at handling controversy, at producing satisfying syntheses - he has the unusual ability to take the valid points from opposing factions. So he'll happily concede that \"science is a social construct\" - in the solid, trivial sense that we all should concede it is. He'll hear out someone's proposal to <i>intentionally</i> bring <a href=\"https://dl.uswr.ac.ir/bitstream/Hannan/79508/1/2018%20Lancet%20Volume%20392%20Issue%2010155%20October%20%2814%29.pdf\">political bias</a> into science, and simply note that, while it's well-intentioned, we have less counterproductive options.\n\nDon't get the audiobook: Ritchie is describing a complex system of interlocking failures. I need <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JimmyRis/status/1260723455244349441\">diagrams</a> for that sort of thing.\n\nRitchie is fair, funny, and actually understands the technical details.

    "review": "More of the same witty early moderns: modern speech atop medieval action. (Anachronistically witty, sceptical?) Mantel manages to make all the tiresome court manoeuvring interesting just by having it pass through Cromwell, her sensitive, competent monster.\r\n\r\nHalfway through, Cromwell turns from rational underdog to corrupt totalitarian. Or, halfway through you realise that this turn has happened, that this aspect was there. He kills his enemies based on hearsay and jokes, zero physical and eyewitness evidence. Mantel manages this fall in a smooth and inevitable way. I complain about current legal systems a lot, but at least their errors are not this unjust and merely political.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>When Gregory says, 'Are they guilty?' he means, 'Did they do it?' But when [Thomas] says, 'Are they guilty?' he means, 'Did the court find them so?' The lawyer's world is entire unto itself, the human pared away. It was a triumph, in a small way, to unknot the entanglement of thighs and tongues, to take that mass of heaving flesh and smooth it on to white paper: as the body, after the climax, lies back on white linen. He has seen beautiful indictments, not a word wasted.\r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>“Nothing makes you falter,” Wyatt says. He says it with a reluctant admiration that is close to dread. But he, Cromwell, thinks, I did falter but no one knows it, reports have not gone abroad. Wyatt did not see me walk away from Weston’s interrogation. Wyatt did not see me when Anne asked me what I believed in my heart.\r\n\r\nHe rests his eyes on the prisoner, he takes his seat. He says softly, “I think I have been training all my years for this. I have served an apprenticeship to myself.” His whole career has been an education in hypocrisy. \r\n</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n\r\nLots of artistic licence, to patch over the huge gaps in the historical record (as Mantel admits in the postscript). Cromwell is sympathetic here, even with all the blood and lies - you notice his evil only after effort. But this is just the same treatment that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More#Campaign_against_the_Protestant_Reformation\">Thomas More</a> has enjoyed for a hundred years, in several <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDBiLT3LASk\">beautiful retcons</a>. And the worst of the blood and the torture came after both of them.\r\n\r\nMaybe 4 stars later",

    "review": "Great fun!\n\nReynolds describes an <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/\">Archipelago epistocracy</a> - that is, a loose collection of thousands of city-states with their own weird constitutions (voluntary fascisms, upload city, voluntary coma land, luxury <i>Running Man</i> land), with federal votes weighted by your past performance at predicting / causing good changes. The only federal crimes are voting related: messing with the central vote, denying their citizens the vote. (They don't seem to enforce the other thing you'd need to make this minimally acceptable: iron exit rights.) \n\nReynolds is clearly also having fun here, where I found <i>Revelation Space</i> exhaustingly grim and sepia.\n\nI particularly loved his entire society of <a href=\"https://michaelwstory.com/\">professional</a> superforecasters / high-quality futarchist voting bloc, who make their living off lobbyists and being bellwethers and spend most of their time buggering about with hobbies. (You are ejected if your calibration drops below 50% better than normal people.)\n\nHe husbands his twists, and keeps almost all characters in the dark (including the antagonists) all the time. It also takes the horror of exponentials seriously; machine intelligence's scalability is the worst thing about it, and here we get two great scary instances.\n\nOne downside is that it feels like book #3 in a series; maybe one infodump too few or something.

    "review": "Both rushed and too long. Characters do lots of excessively dumb stuff, including the most sober and clever characters, Dreyfus and Aumonier, who both act like Maverick badasses here. The contrivance at the beginning (to artificially promote Ng and concoct some drama with Sparver) is too transparent. Way too many board meetings with people doing an increment of exposition and muttering darkly.\n\nThere is another scary exponential problem, but unlike in the last book, halfway through it gets capped at 2000 potential deaths. Intentionally small stakes can be good (see <i>Cibola Burn</i> from the Expanse series), but here it just sends up the emoting and silliness from previously professional agents.\n\nStill readable, but it undermines the characters that made the first pop.",

    "review": "More playful and miscellaneous than I was expecting. As always with him, there are grand gears turning in the background of his stories: there's more to his worlds than we see, and reasons beyond what the characters reason. But overall not as stunning as his novels, even accounting for scale. This is not surprising when you realise that the earliest of these was written when he was a teenager. He really hits his stride halfway through this, 1980.\n\nThe main intellectual success is his depiction of anarchism, as stable, unstable, predatory, kind, natural, or requiring unnatural underpinning.\n\nI loved his forewords to each story:\n<blockquote><i>\"The quality of the writing is about average for what I could manage in the 1960s... And the ideas? Ah, there's the problem. To date, \"The Accomplice\" is the most irritating combination of embarrassing gaffes and neat insights that I have ever created.\"</i></blockquote>\n\nGreat fun but not as mind-bending as Egan or Chiang or Borges or Vinge. \n\nRanked:\n1. 'The Ungoverned'. How could anarchism resist invasion?: By being too expensive to conquer.\n2. The Peddlar's Apprentice'. Neat post-post-apocalypse. The control group are the good guys.\n3. 'Long Shot'.\n4. 'The Blabber'.\n5. 'Fast Times at Fairmont High'.\n6. 'Just Peace'.\n7. 'Conquest by Default'. Yet another anarchism, but with true aliens this time. Patches the gap in nonaggression with religious dogma: all obey the anti-monopoly priests. Colonialist anarchists!!\n8. 'Original Sin'.\n9. 'Bomb Scare'.\n10. 'Apartness'.\n11. 'The Whirligig of Time'. Tries too hard to be lyrical about nuclear holocaust. Rare depiction of winners of a nuclear war! Monarchy returns to post-apocalypse Russia, and then somehow they get to super advanced tech despite authoritarian thought control. You can feel the actual physical model straining underneath the prose and morals.\n12. 'Win a Nobel Prize!'.\n13. 'Run, Bookworm!'.\n14. 'The Science Fair'.\n15. 'Gemstone'.\n16. 'The Accomplice'.\n",

    "review": "Very grim, sickly, but also very likeable. It succeeds at several rare things: depicting a scientist protagonist actually thinking in extremis; depicting an alien ecosystem, a thing with its own thing going on, misaligned with us but not hateful or a mere inversion of human value; relatedly, noticing the great horror story that is an ordinary ecosystem; depicting the common, vital, neglected fact that being <i>really</i> interested in something can systematically outweigh your fear, insecurity, hatred, love.\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nI could easily lose hours there, observing the hidden life of tidal pools, and sometimes I marveled at the fact that I had been given such a gift: not just to lose myself in the present moment so utterly but also to have such solitude, which was all I had ever craved during my studies, my practice to reach this point.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe prose is refined, sometimes faintly echoing Cormac McCarthy:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nThis water was so dark we could see our faces in it, and it never stirred, set like glass, reflecting the beards of gray moss that smothered the cypress trees. If you looked out through these areas, toward the ocean, all you saw was the black water, the gray of the cypress trunks, and the constant, motionless rain of moss flowing down. All you heard was the low moaning. The effect of this cannot be understood without being there. The beauty of it cannot be understood, either, and when you see beauty in desolation it changes something inside you. Desolation tries to colonize you.” \r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe creatures / mind of Area X are scary, but not in a jump scare or serial killer way. They're just different. There's horror in nature, and the best PR team ever (Wordsworth, Muir, Attenborough) can't fully disguise this from you. Vast endless <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichneumonidae#Reproduction_and_diet\">torture</a> is part of its horror, but the rest is just difference and inevitability and scale. VanderMeer ties the spooky weirdness of Area X to the opacity and inhumanity of nature:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nthe longer I stared at it, the less comprehensible the creature became. The more it became something alien to me, the more I had a sense that I knew nothing at all — about nature, about ecosystems. There was something about my mood and its dark glow that eclipsed sense, that made me see this creature, which had indeed been assigned a place in the taxonomy--catalogued, studied, and described--irreducible down to any of that. And if I kept looking, I knew that ultimately I would have to admit I knew less than nothing about myself as well, whether that was a lie or the truth.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nFor a cosmic horror book, the biologist manages to avoid mysterianism amongst deep mysteries. VanderMeer keeps her thinking even in the face of her senses failing:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n    I am aware that all of this speculation is incomplete, inexact, inaccurate, useless. If I don’t have real answers, it is because we still don’t know what questions to ask. Our instruments are useless, our methodology broken, our motivations selfish.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nYou need to be comfortable with unresolved tension and inexplicable mythos and jarring shifts in tone and meaning. You need to be comfortable seeing the whole thing from a strange view, \"the biologist's\". People call her antisocial and autistic, but really she's just completely internally motivated: she cannot give a fuck, she will not make herself likeable, will not spill her guts for you. Like this book. \r\n\r\nMaybe 4/5 if I keep thinking about it later.",

    "review": "What a book! Four books, bolted together in the manner of an undergraduate pulling an all-nighter. You can read it as pure <i>Treasure Island</i> / <i>Three Musketeers</i> pulp, if you squint. But underneath is a whole view of human nature, of French Restoration perversity, of class anxiety after the People have vented themselves, and minute details of how French society worked. It contains digressions on merchant shipping, stoner drivel, interest rates, Napoleon's legacy, the ethnography of Parisian opera-goers, Roman cab fare, made up nonsense about Tunisian royalty, optical telegraphs, and I love it. 100 characters. Fun and irreverent and grand and petty and solemn and nerdy. Like a city on wheels.\r\n<blockquote><i> \r\nin your place I should say nothing of all these adventures. Your life story is a novel; and people, though they love novels bound between two yellow paper covers, are oddly suspicious of those which come to them in living vellum, even when they are as gilded as you are capable of being.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nPublished a chapter at a time, and Dumas was paid by the word, and it shows. But it shows in the other way too: this is a live thing. For once I don't begrudge you your abridged edition: half of this is superfluous. The first 30 chapters are best: joy, betrayal, madness, education, escape, redemption. And Albert is incredibly annoying, and gets 10 chapters. But c'mon, just do a chapter a night for 3 months.\r\n\r\nYou will put up with heavy telegraphing:\r\n<blockquote><i> \"...I must go to Paris.”\r\n“Ah, really?—to Paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been there, Dantès?”\r\n“Yes.”\r\n“Have you business there?”\r\n“Not of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere...”\r\n“Yes, yes, I understand,” said Danglars, and then in a low tone, he added, “To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an idea—a capital idea! Ah; Dantès, my friend, you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship Pharaon;” then turning towards Edmond, who was walking away, “A pleasant journey,” he cried.\r\n“Thank you,” said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nBuss' translation is immaculate. You occasionally see the strain of an odd idiom, but in the same way you see a master athlete flex to pull off something hard.\r\n\r\nDantès is a simple romantic hero; or a heartless villain, a vampire; or a revenant of the revolution. (He isn't a radical, <i>until he is punished for being one</i>.) Or as class anxiety. Dantès the pirate, Dantès the entryist, Dantès the stalker, Dantès the god. The book imagines a perfect impostor, who has learned all the contrived tricks of the aristocracy, and with bottomless pockets. A parvenu you can't detect. A nemesis you don't know about. Betrayal transforms him from a noble peasant to a vicious overlord.(I thought my class-war reading was a stretch until I learned who <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas-Alexandre_Dumas\">Dumas' dad</a> was. Dumas saw either side.)\r\n\r\nDantès is, for the latter 3/4 of the book, not good. This isn't a matter of interpretation: he owns slaves, loves executions, and deludes everyone around him with fake virtue and kindness! He is an obsessed agent of narrow justice, a perfect liar, and a 'vampire'. Another instance of how terrible and inhuman justice can be. The novel tacitly condemns Dantès from Chapter 30 onwards: outwardly he lacks feeling (is deadly pale). So we're <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/07/the-great-divide-emily-nussbaum\">bad fans</a>.\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nFranz, meanwhile, was thinking about the extraordinary shudder that had passed through the whole of the Count of Monte Cristo’s body at the moment when he was more or less obliged to give Albert his hand. \r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nInternally, he rages - but to the point of moving entirely beyond passion. <i>Focus</i> as the opposite of emotion. He is a mastermind, an implausibly good planner and reasoner - all in the service of fatal romance.\r\n\r\n* The central transformation of the book is much more extreme than <i>Pygmalion</i> or <i>My Fair Lady</i>.\r\n\r\n* Its great lesson is that evil can result from <i>mild</i> vice: envy, whim, irritation. The great silly convenience of the plot is the perfect anti-correlation between virtue and success: all of the idle conspirators reach the heights of society for unrelated reasons.\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n\"I’m convinced that, sooner or later, a righteous man is rewarded and a wicked one punished.\"\r\n\"You're a man of the cloth, Monsieur l'Abbe,\" said Caderousse with a bitter look, \"and it's your job to say that. But everyone is free to disbelieve what you claim... [Ruin:] That's how God rewards virtue, Monsieur.\" \r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nOn the whole, M. de Villefort made and returned few visits... this was accepted in society, where it was attributed to the amount and gravity of the lawyer's business - when it was, in reality, deliberate arrogance, an extreme example of aristocratic contempt, in short, the application of the maxim: ‘Admire yourself and others will admire you', a hundred times more useful in our day than the Greek one: ‘Know thyself', now replaced by the less demanding and more profitable art of knowing others.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nand so Dantes' perfect uber-dickhead counter to Villefort:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n\"despite your reputation as a superior being, you see everything from the vulgar and material point of view of society, beginning and ending with man, that is to say, the most restricted and narrow point of view that human intelligence can adopt.’ \r\n\r\n‘I beg you to explain yourself, sir,’ said Villefort, more and more astonished. I don’t entirely follow...’ \r\n\r\n‘What I’m saying, sir, is that your eyes are fixed on the social organisation of nations that means that you only see the mechanism and not the sublime worker who operates it. I'm saying that you only recognise in front of you and around you those office-holders whose accreditation has been signed by a minister or by the king and that your short-sightedness leads you to ignore those men whom God has set above office-holders, ministers and kings, by giving them a mission to pursue instead of a position to fill. This weakness is inherent in humans, with their feeble and inadequate organs. \r\n\r\nTobias mistook the angel who had just restored his sight for an ordinary young man. The nations mistook Attila, who would annihilate them, for a conqueror like other conquerors. It was necessary for both to reveal their celestial missions for them to be recognised - for one to say: “I'm the angel of the Lord”, and the other: “I’m the hammer of God”, for their divine essence to be revealed.’ \r\n‘Does this mean,' Villefort said, increasingly amazed and thinking he must be speaking to a visionary or a madman, ‘that you consider yourself to be like one of these extraordinary beings you have just mentioned?’ \r\n‘Why not?' Monte Cristo asked coldly. \r\n\"Please forgive me, sir,\" Villefort continued in bewilderment, \"if when I called on you I was not aware that I was to be introduced to a man whose understanding and mind extend so far beyond the \r\nordinary knowledge and usual cast of thought of mankind... it is not customary for those who enjoy the privilege of wealth to waste their time in social speculation and philosophical dreams that are rather designed to console those whom fate has deprived of the goods of the earth.\"\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n* The adults are corrupt, the youth innocent but trivially corruptible.\r\n\r\n* The surprisingly good cartoon adaption, <i>Gankutsuou</i>, focusses on polymorphous homoerotic undertones barely present here. (It also has bad CGI battle robots.)\r\n\r\n* Is it money that corrupts him, rather than betrayal and injustice? Dantès is still relatively virtuous, human in the events following his escape. But not when he passes from redeemer to revenant. \r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nthree months earlier [he] had wanted nothing except freedom, felt already not free enough, but wanted wealth. It was not the fault of Dantès, but of God who, while limiting the power of man, has created in him infinite desires!\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n*\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nhe was paying the meal the compliment one would expect from a man condemned for four or five months to suffer Italian cooking (which is among the worst in the world).\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n* On being ransomed to a kidnapper, Luigi:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n'Signor Luigi,’ Albert continued, ‘are there any other formalities to be completed before we may take leave of Your Excellency?’\r\n‘None at all, sir,’ the bandit said. ‘You are as free as the air.’ \r\n‘In that case, I wish you a long life and good fortune. Come, gentlemen, come!’ \r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n* Word count word count word count:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\na man in a blue jacket, with silk buttons of the same colour, a white waistcoat crossed by a huge gold chain and hazel-coloured trousers, with a head of such black hair, worn so low above the eyebrows that it seemed hardly natural, being so inconsistent with those wrinkles on the forehead that it was unable to disguise; in short, a man of between 50 and 55, trying to look 40, put his head out of the window of a coupe with a baron's crown painted on its door, and sent his groom to enquire of the concierge whether the Count of Monte Cristo was at home. \r\n\r\nAs he waited, the man examined the exterior of the house, what could be seen of the garden and the livery of a few servants who might be observed coming and going - and did so with such close attention as to amount almost to impertinence. His eye was sharp, but with more cunning in it than wit or irony. \r\n\r\nHis lips were so thin that they vanished inside the mouth instead of protruding from it. Finally, the breadth and prominence of the cheekbones (an infallible sign of shrewdness), the retreating forehead, the bulging occiput which extended well beyond his wide and not in the least aristocratic ears, all contributed to give this gentleman (whom any ordinary person would have thought very respectable in view of his magnificent horses, the enormous diamond he wore in his shirt and the red ribbon that stretched from one buttonhole to another on his coat), a face which to a trained physiognomist betrayed an almost repulsive character.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe book broadened my sense of Romanticism; previously I had a pretty shallow idea of it, as if 100 years of clever people would not produce interesting thoughts as well as pure emoting. Consider the ridiculous faculties and ingenuity of Abbe Faria (competence porn!). It's not about feelings, or, it doesn't begin and end in feeling. It's about will over circumstance, virtue over accident, doing whatever extreme things it takes, to drive a passion into the earth. Romanticism is ridiculous, but it doesn't care about being ridiculous.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n\"Often we pass beside happiness without seeing it, without looking at it, or, even if we have seen and looked at it, without recognizing it... Your throne will be raised up on the mountain where Satan took Jesus. And, without having to pay him homage, without having to kiss his claw, you will be the sovereign master of all the kingdoms on earth.\r\n\r\nDo not be content with just one experiment: as with everything, the senses must become accustomed to a new impression, whether it is pleasant or not, happy or sad. Nature wrestles with this divine substance, because our nature is not made for joy but clings to pain. Nature must be defeated in this struggle, reality must follow dreams; and then the dream will rule, will become the master, the dream will become life and life become a dream. What a difference is made by this transfiguration! When you compare the sorrows of real life to the pleasures of the imaginary one, you will never want to live again, only to dream for ever. When you leave your world for that of others, you will feel as if you have travelled from spring in Naples to winter in Lapland, from paradise to earth, from heaven to hell. Try some hashish, my friend! Try it!\"\r\n</i></blockquote>",

Nudity is rather a device to show a character’s shame, fear, emotional connection, desolation, surrender (Yamaguchi will draw them unclothed in one panel when actually they aren’t). X-ray views go even further: to be laid bare, to be owned. The gore is a device to show... that the human body is composed of very small bits.\r\n\r\nAll main characters are bloodthirsty prideful knaves. But virtuous in their way.

    "review": "Clever portrait of his own descent into madness, or into subculture. The pain and the disgusting force-feeding would be enough, but on top of that there’s the steroids, the constant talcing and oiling, the insane fasting, the niacin overdose to make you flush all over, the injection of inflammatories... He openly depicts his bulking up as a tactic to face the violence and mania of New York, but he is soon swept into growth for growth’s sake. He hates himself, and for four years he takes hyperbolic vengeance on his body.\r\n\r\nWeights were more stigmatised in the 80s, so part of this is an apologia, including many moments of giant generosity from his fellow meat-men. But most of it shows the grotesqueness of contorting a body like this, of forcing a life to be about one thing only, any one thing. (Only a very small part of the horror comes from Fussell - a sensitive perceptive Ivy League shoo-in - doing it.) The mental poverty of the lifter credo is yet another stricture.\r\n\r\nYou should not underestimate the psychological effects of exercise this intense. He becomes a swaggering, brutal loon within months; he stops doing anything at work:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nat work my muscular behavior became a cause of concern on the floor. It was the general consensus that I had gone too far. Way too far. Some could understand the need to “fill out,” as I put it, and gain a few pounds. But two hour sessions in the morning and two more hours at night, five meals a day, vitamin supplements, and protein shakes?\r\nAnd if that wasn’t enough, well, there was the noise of my accouterments and the demands of my discipline. I installed an industrial-strength stainless steel blender in my cubicle for my shakes. I monopolized the floor’s sole refrigerator for my meats and milk and eggs, and continuously worked the microwave for a fresh feeding.\r\n\r\nMy cubicle, which I renamed The Growth Center, became a depot for desiccated beef liver tablets, multivitamin packs, bag after bag of branch-chain amino acids, cartons of Carboplex (a carbohydrate concentrate), and protein powder. What with the magazines and the canon scattered across the floor, the whole place was a muscle minefield, but I didn’t see it that way, not then. Not when I was caught in the full raging force of “the disease.”\r\n\r\n... Childhood friends called me in consternation. Apparently, my folly was so spectacular, so profoundly perverse, that even they had gotten wind of it. It was worse, somehow, than enlisting in the Marines or buying finger cymbals and joining the Hare Krishnas.\r\n\r\n... “Hasn’t it ever crossed your mind that this whole enterprise is rather vulgar? Is it your parents you want to hurt? Is that it? Is it your friends? Are you waiting for this to appear in the Alumni Notes? Goddamnit, why not do something with your life you can really be proud of?”\r\n\r\n... “My physical metamorphosis had brought with it a completely different way of perceiving the world and my place in it... I had needed an attitude adjustment. And I don’t know exactly when the transformation happened—all I can say is that it did. Without being fully aware of it myself, I became the kind of man I had once feared and despised. I became, in fact, a bully...\r\n\r\nThen, my manner of speech. It had been too tame before, too timid. No wonder I never got my way in life. I went from answering the phone meekly to shrieking “SPEAK!” into the receiver on the first ring\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt’s extremely well written, tasteful and droll and honest, and rammed full of unusual detail. But something is missing.\r\n\r\nHow much of the spiritual effects were from weights, from pharmaceuticals, or from simply overloading a devotion to something, anything?\r\n\r\nI lift, but never like this. I don’t think I do anything so intensely. I, my style and viewpoint, would not survive it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://bnjmnmddn.com/on-sam-fussell-s-muscle\">Lovely review by a scholar-lifter</a>",

However, the scientist may discover a flaw in the argument that leads him change his mind and to discover a way to do it... \r\n\r\nThe legal thinker will merely try to patch the flaw in the argument, because, once he has chosen a side, all his intelligence is devoted to finding arguments for that side.</i></blockquote>\r\n― John McCarthy\r\n\r\nI was a bit of a legalist as a young man: completely gripped by what Galef calls the \"soldier mindset\", the urge to win arguments and cling to your positions, rather than find the truth. I was a philosophy student. Philosophy is supposed to be dispassionate and open-minded, but in fact the sheer number of degrees of freedom in it, and the absence of conclusive evidence lead to the usual bias and inertia. (We can name positions after philosophers because so few change their minds.) A certain level of intelligence and knowledge of say logical fallacies can end up trapping you, since you can usually improvise a fix for the deadly new fact, or anyway say \"you too!\".\r\n\r\nOr not. This is an uplifting and useful set of stories about moving from the (pretty diseased) default mode of thinking to be, on average, less deluded and unfair. If you spend much time looking at internet arguments, or TV news debates, or other kinds of stupid war then you'll be cheered, and - who knows - healed, by Galef's examples of people changing their minds and running the numbers, against their current narrowly construed interests. \r\n\r\nGalef is a master of this, as you can see from basically any of her radio episodes.\r\n\r\nThis would have helped the young legalist realise what he was doing, and might have sped him on the road.\r\n\r\nMuch more like a normal business book than I expected, with three-sentence stories of [random CEO]'s [triumph | desolation], and with more references to other self-help books. I'll accept this as airport bookshop camouflage. It is a friendly first step into honest reason.\r\n\r\nThe principles are not new, but the illustrating anecdotes are, and the writing is utterly, crashingly accessible in the Bestseller Nonfiction style, and it's short and sunny, and anyway it is a vital public service to redo <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eristic\">Plato</a> / Laplace / Schopenhauer / Peirce / Russell / Kahneman / Hanson / <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/34XxbRFe54FycoCDw/the-bottom-line\">Yudkowsky</a> / Galef, every say two years til the end of time. \r\n\r\nNews to me:\r\n\r\n* The London Homeopathic Hospital had the best results during the Victorian cholera epidemic, for reasons unrelated to homeopathy (clean sheets and proto-rehydration therapy). Still dismal 18% mortality.\r\n\r\n* Spock has a Brier score above 0.5: way worse than the average forecaster on low-stakes internet platforms (0.25), and somewhat worse than a flipping coin.\r\n\r\n* An author of the Christian abstinence craze was persuaded that his book (advising that teens not even date other teens) was harmful, and stopped selling it.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/\">Galef type</a>:\r\n\r\nData #2: surprising case studies\r\nTheory #2: models of what makes something succeed or fail\r\nTheory #5: a general lens you can use to analyze many different things\r\nValues #1: an explicit argument about values\r\nThinking #1: teach principles of thinking directly",

Full of cryptic references to early C20th American sports heroes, Greek astronomy and maths, and full page symbols without explanation.

    "review": "Chinese is great for aphorism, because it’s so concise and full of rhymes. But the content of this disappointed me; I was looking for wit, something I’d want to use, and mostly got hectoring maxims in a parental or lordly mode. Lots of comparing people to work animals or resources (lumber).\r\n\r\nA lot of the advice, like the whole section about shutting your mouth, is overfit to China, or ancient China. Either way, revealing. But nothing here is as crystallised as the admonition to a loud or whirling child: “[have a] <a href=\"https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=https://zh.m.wiktionary.org/zh-hans/%25E5%25B0%258F%25E5%25BF%2583&prev=search&pto=aue\">small heart!</a></i>” \r\n\r\nVery good beginner’s Mandarin practice. The originals are sometimes pithy, the translations are mostly trite (two or three times as long), and easily improvable (see below). The hanzi are very simple, HSK3 would do.\r\n\r\nA few old chestnuts turn out to be Chinese (“A picture is worth a thousand words”, “give a man a fish”) Notable:\r\n\r\n“Beyond the sky another sky; beyond the mountain another mountain.” [always a bigger fish] 天外有天，山外有山。\r\n“A tongue weighs little, but can crush a man.” 舌头底下压死人。\r\n“A monk can flee, but his temple can’t.” [the authorities catch you through your family and workplace.] 跑了和尚跑不了庙。\r\n“A poor man can stand right there, no one will ask how he is; a rich man can hide in the hills, but distant relatives will come visit.” 穷在路边无人问，富在深山有远亲。”\r\n“A friend who understands you feels close even in the farthest corners of the earth.” 海内存知己，天涯若比邻。\r\n“Tall trees catch the wind [and get knocked down].” 树大招风。\r\n“Pure water won’t support fish” 水清不养鱼。\r\n“A child never thinks their mother ugly, a dog never thinks their master poor.” 儿不嫌母丑，狗不嫌贫。\r\n“Of the 10,000 sins, pervertedness is worst; of the hundred virtues, filial piety is first.” 万恶淫为首，百善孝为先。\r\n“A married daughter is like spilt water.” 嫁出去的女儿，泼出去的水\r\n“Like a bug blocking a chariot” 螳臂挡车. (“You can’t fight City Hall”)\r\n“The tigers of the east devour men, as do the tigers of the west.” 东山的老虎吃人，西山的老虎也吃人。\r\n“Don’t strike a dog before you see its master’s face.” 打狗看主面”\r\n“Governing a nation is like cooking a small fish [too much handling will spoil it]” 治大国如烹小鱼\r\n“People must climb; let water flow downwards.” 人往高处走，水往低处流",

    "review": "God help an artist with a comfy white-collar job. It’s not that his suffering isn’t real, it’s not even that it’s necessarily much less intense than people with harder jobs, no jobs, back-breaking jobs, entirely abstract and zero-feedback jobs. But to write about the misery of your easy meaningless labour - even this well - without a moment of perspective is an artistic and spiritual failure. But it’s a great failure and I appreciate his heartlessness, narcissism, his latent Marxism foiled by apathy, his Romanticism scuttled by irony. It’s a logical tantrum, even when the gerbil king tells him to kill himself.\r\n\r\nWe hear no one but him; they are mute while he is unceasing. These stories are intended as horror without monsters (observe the lettering font he uses, or the mouthlessness or literal voicelessness of the characters). What would self-awareness cost him? His “being above this”, “being underemployed”, being an “(overproduced) elite” are not the only view of the arrangement, or even a very good one. \r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nAll of the days should be mine.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nAnyway aren’t corporate jobs dreadful. Nicholson comes up with my favourite ever image for the feeling of alienated work: resting to recover your “juice”, only to be stabbed the next day with multiple taps to drain it from you, a finite flow that also drives your personal projects. \r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nThe company won two-thirds of my life, and drained the juices from my driven flesh for its own needless product.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nThe alcoholism chapter is very moving, very degraded.\r\n\r\nThe artist characters have no mouths; only the salespeople and the boss have them, big grins six inches tall.\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nA hatred was in her voice that would take a grip of your inner organs.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnyway this is best in its class and even ends with acceptance(?)(?) of a 20 year career in Geographical Info Systems(?). Probably avoid if you’re currently in a shit job.",

    "review": "Quite scattered and prolonged, with too many plots, thus ending up feeling like no plot. But still good. (People say this is the worst one but it is still better than most novels.) There are 30 notable moments (sailors as manservants, Mrs Williams’ idiot machiavellianism, Scrivens’ poster, the Canning offer, the experimental weapon, press-ganging the debt-bailiffs, dressing Jack as a bear, the undischarged duel, Jack’s powerful fear of bees) and 5 or so bravura passages\r\n<blockquote><i>Tides, tides, the Cove of Cork, the embarkation waiting on the moon, a tall swift-pacing mule in the bare torrid mountains quivering in the sun, palmetto-scrub, Señor don Esteban Maturin y Domanova kisses the feet of the very reverend Lord Abbot of Montserrat and begs the honour of an audience. The endless white road winding, the inhuman landscape of Aragon, cruel sun and weariness, dust, weariness to the heart, and doubt. What was independence but a word? What did any form of government matter? Freedom: to do what? Disgust, so strong that he leant against the saddle, hardly able to bring himself to mount. A shower on the Maladetta, and everywhere the scent of thyme: eagles wheeling under thunder-clouds, rising, rising. 'My mind is too confused for anything but direct action,' he said. 'The flight disguised as an advance.”\r\n\r\n“The lonely beach, lanterns flashing from the offing, an infinity of sea. Ireland again, with such memories at every turn. 'If I could throw off some of this burden of memory,' said Stephen to his second glass of laudanum, 'I should be more nearly sane. Here's to you, Villiers, my dear.' The Holyhead mail and two hundred and seventy miles of rattling jerking, falling asleep, waking in another country: rain, rain, rain: Welsh voices in the night. London, and his report, trying to disentangle the strands of altruism, silliness, mere enthusiasm, self-seeking, love of violence, personal resentment; trying too to give the impossible plain answer to the question 'Is Spain going to join France against us, and if so, when?' And there he was in Deal once more, sitting alone in the snug of the Rose and Crown, watching the shipping in the Downs and drinking a pot of tea: he had an odd detachment from all this familiar scene - the uniforms that passed outside his bow-window were intimately well known, but it was as though they belonged to another world, a world at one or two removes, and as though their inhabitants, walking, laughing, talking out[…]”</i> </blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>‘Two roast-beefs to see you, sir,' said an orderly.\r\n'Oh no!' cried Captain Christy-Pallière, 'not at this hour, holy name. Tell them I am not here, Jeannot. I may be back at five. Who are they?'\r\n'The first is Aubrey, Jacques. He claims to be a captain in their navy,' said the orderly, narrowing his eyes and scanning the official slip in his hand. 'Born 1 April 1066, at Bedlam, London. Father's profession, monk: mother's, nun. Mother's maiden name, Borgia, Lucrèce. The other pilgrim is Maturin, Etienne -'\r\n'Quick, quick,' cried Captain Christy-Pallière. 'My breeches, Jeannot, my cravat -' for ease and commodity he had been sitting in his drawers. 'Son of a whore, my shirt. Penhoet, we must have a real dinner today - find a clothes-brush, Jeannot - this is the English prisoner I was telling you about. Excellent seaman, charming company. You will not mind speaking English, of course. How do I look?'\r\n'So pimping as possible,' said Captain Penhoet in that language. 'Camber the torso, and you will impose yourself of their attention. </i> </blockquote>\r\n\r\nBut all the foxhunting and marriage chitchat does derail things a lot. A perfect summary of Jack’s foolish idea of romance, which is still the default one:\r\n<blockquote><i>It occurred to him that he should put some order into his thoughts about these two [women]. Yet there was something so very odious, so very grossly indecent, in making any sort of comparison, in weighing up, setting side by side, evaluating. Stephen blamed him for being muddle-headed, wantonly muddle-headed, refusing to follow his ideas to their logical conclusion. 'You have all the English vices, my dear, including muddle-headed sentiment and hypocrisy.' Yet it was nonsense to drag in logic where logic did not apply. To think clearly in such a case was inexpressibly repugnant: logic could apply only to a deliberate seduction or to a marriage of interest.</i> </blockquote>\r\nO’Brian does the following often (a quick cut, or object transition, or something):\r\n<blockquote><i>‘If you are to see the First Lord in the morning, your mind must be in a condition of easy complaisance, in a placid, rested state. There is milk in the little crock - warmed milk will relax the fibres.'\r\n\r\nJack warmed it, added a dash of rum from his case-bottle, and drank it up; but in spite of his faith in the draught, the fibres remained tense, the placidity of mind a great way off.</i> </blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph is at a party; the second is back at home, with the farewells, cloakroom, cab-hailing, ride, and key-fumbling all elided. Jack has warped through the mention of milk, to the milk. So simple, but because it demands an inference it slows me down and gives me a lift, once or twice a chapter. Flatters the reader, saves on boring exposition, and provides a visual click, all in one.\r\n\r\nNot impressed with Villiers yet.\r\n<blockquote><i>Even a frigid, self-sufficing man needs something of this interchange if he is not to die in his unmechanical part: natural philosophy, music, dead men's conversation, is not enough...\r\n\r\nIt was not that he did not like the land - capital place; such games, such fun - but the difficulties there, the complications, were so vague and imprecise, reaching one behind another, no end to them: nothing a man could get hold of. Here, although life was complex enough in all conscience, he could at least attempt to cope with anything that turned up. Life at sea had the great advantage that - something was amiss.</i></blockquote>",

    "review": "I shed a tear for Dil.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Killick was a cross-grained bastard, who supposed that if he sprinkled his discourse with a good many sirs, the words in between did not signify: but still he had procured this coffee, these eggs, this butter, this soft tack, on shore and had put them on the table the morning after a hot engagement—ship still cleared for action and the galley knocked sideways by the fire from Cape Béar. Jack had known Killick ever since his first command, and as he had risen in rank so Killick's sullen independence had increased; he was angrier than usual now because Jack had wrecked his number three uniform and lost one of his gloves: 'Coat torn in five places—cutlass slash in the forearm which how can I ever darn that? Bullet 'ole all singed, never get the powder-marks out. Breeches all a-hoo, and all this nasty blood everywhere, like you'd been a-wallowing in a lay-stall, sir. What Miss would say, I don't know, sir. God strike me blind. Epaulette 'acked, fair 'acked to pieces. (Jesus, what a life.)</i></blockquote>\r\nQuotations from Dryden throughout, nice dark tart verses.\r\n<blockquote><i>Once he had established that Jack and Hervey were connected with families he knew, he treated them as human beings; all the others as dogs—but as good, quite intelligent dogs in a dog-loving community. He was ceremonious, naturally kind, and he had a great and oppressive sense of duty. </i></blockquote>\r\nOn the vulgarity of true aristos:\r\n<blockquote><i>General Aubrey belonged to another civilisation, a civilisation untouched by the age of enlightenment or the spread of the bourgeoisie, one that had passed away in the counties nearer London long before Sophie was born and one to which her essentially urban, respectable, middle-class family had never belonged at any time. She had been brought up in a quiet, staid, manless house and she did not know what to make of his gallantries, his praise of Jack's taste (Cecilia would have been more at home with him); nor of his observation that Jack was a sad dog—always had been—but she was not to mind it—Jack's mother never had. Sophia would not mind half a dozen love-children, he was sure. </i></blockquote>\r\nOn innovation:\r\n<blockquote><i>“But any gait, all of 'em you see in this weather line, is what we call twelve-hundred-tonners; though to be sure some gauges thirteen and even fifteen hundred ton, Thames measurement. Wexford, there, with her brass fo'c'sle eight-pounder winking in the sun, she does: but we call her a twelve hundred ton ship.'\r\n   'Sir, might it not be simpler to call her a fifteen hundred ton ship?'\r\n   'Simpler, maybe: but it would never do. You don't want to be upsetting the old ways. Oh dear me, no. God's my life, if the Captain was to hear you “carrying on in that reckless Jacobin, democratical line, why, I dare say he would turn you adrift on a three-inch plank, with both your ears nailed down to it, to learn you bashfulness, the way he served three young gentlemen in the Med. No, no: you don't want to go arsing around with the old ways: the French did so, and look at the scrape it has gotten them into” </i></blockquote>\r\nOne jarring bit: Stephen the caring pacifist is extremely quick to fight lethal duels over minor points of honour. This is partly down to his aiming to be nonlethal, but come on.\r\n<blockquote><i>‘He was blaming his particular friend for romantic notions the other day—the friend who is to marry the daughter of that woman we saw just now—and if I had not been so shocked by his condition, I should have been tempted to laugh. He is himself a perfect Quixote: an enthusiastic supporter of the Revolution until '93; a United Irishman until the rising, Lord Edward's adviser—his cousin, by the way—'\r\n   'Is he a Fitzgerald?'\r\n   'The wrong side of the blanket. And now Catalan independence. Or perhaps I should say, Catalan independence from the beginning, simultaneously with the others. But always heart and soul, blood and purse in some cause from which he can derive no conceivable personal benefit’ </i></blockquote>\r\nSurprisingly good afterword by Charlton Heston. The list of O’Brian megafans is funny: Iris Murdoch, Tom Stoppard, Joan Didion, David Mamet, Eudora Welty, Mark Knopfler, Walter Cronkite, George Will. Is there anything else they agree on?",

Sooner or later someone decided it needed organizing, and the one thing you could be sure of was that the organizers weren't going to be the people who, by general acknowledgement, were at the top of their craft.

Jack making friends in the asylum is so fun!\r\n<blockquote><i>intelligence services were something else again, little worlds of their own, often inhabited by strange, extreme beings: he knew something of the French and Spanish; he had seen the English in the Dublin of 1798, and the riding-school in Stephen’s Green, where suspects were put to the question. Infamous creatures, most of the questioners; but even honourable, humane men were capable of almost anything for unselfish motives.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe depiction of slavery is very low-key - Diana is not fussed about it for instance - but this is because O’Brian shows the glossy civilised Southern surface and the sick pressure underneath: \r\n<blockquote><i>[The slave], reaching behind Johnson for an empty cup, dropped it on the floor; Johnson whipped round, and Stephen saw her face turn grey as she stared in naked terror, her arms down by her sides; but Johnson turned back to Stephen with a laugh – ‘Where would the china-makers be, if no cups were ever broke?’ – and went on talking about the ivory-billed and the pileated woodpeckers.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nJohnson is a good villain - charming, fluent, energetic, with his violence and vice always third-party, deniable - but a bit similar to Canning.\r\n\r\nI finally catch Maturin in some bullshit:\r\n<blockquote><i>“...after all a monarchy is best.’\r\n‘When you look about the world, and view the monarchs in it – I do not refer to your own, of course – can you really maintain that the hereditary king cuts a very shining figure?’\r\n‘I cannot. Nor is that to the point: the person, unless he be extraordinarily good or extraordinarily bad, is of no importance. It is the living, moving, procreating, sometimes speaking symbol that counts.’\r\n‘But surely mere birth without any necessary merit is illogical?’\r\n‘Certainly, and that is its great merit. Man is a deeply illogical being, and must be ruled illogically. Whatever that frigid prig Bentham may say, there are innumerable motives that have nothing to do with utility. In good utilitarian logic a man does not sell all his goods to go crusading, nor does he build cathedrals; still less does he write verse. There are countless pieties without a name that find their focus in a crown. It is as well, I grant you, that the family should have worn it beyond the memory of man; for your recent creations do not answer – they are nothing in comparison of your priest-king, whose merit is irrelevant, whose place cannot be disputed, nor made the subject of a recurring vote.”</i></blockquote>\r\nPoetry, being quicker than novels and requiring zero capital, comes out pretty well on a real utilitarian view. Cathedrals are good, it's just that they have to wait, after the homeless shelters. And never mind that he justifies illogical monarchy, illogical governance with a <i>logical</i> argument (tacitly anyway - it is Hobbes’ plea for stability, any stability, or maybe an appeal to the great deadweight of political manoeuvring). Never mind Maturin’s own independence fervour, hatred of tyranny, and half republicanism.\r\n\r\nNot that this demeans the book, nor my affection for him, I’m just not used to agreeing with characters so much and it was a relief that Maturin is so real that he does eventually err, or say things just for the sound of them.",

He was handsome, that is to say, in the eyes of those who did not look for the bloom or the slenderness of youth, who admired a big broad-shouldered man with a high complexion, bright blue eyes and yellow hair, and who did not object to a face that had the mark of a cutlass-slash from one ear right across the cheek-bone and another scar, this one from a splinter, along the line of the jaw to the other ear. It was clear that Miss Smith did not, for when he turned and the introduction was made, she looked at him with an eager admiration...\r\n\r\n“seducing poor Aubrey is like taking pennies from a blind man’s hat”\r\n\r\nGothenburg, a melancholy town, most of it quite recently burnt, inhabited by tall spare melancholiacs dressed in grey wool, much given to drinking and self-murder...</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n",

The fact that the dodo has a keel to her breastbone whereas the ostrich and her kind have none presents no moral issue; nor does the dissolution of gold by aqua regia. We erect hypotheses, to be sure, some of us to a most stupendous height, but we always hope to sustain them by demonstrable facts in time: these are not the province of the moralist. Perhaps it might be said that your moral philosopher is in pursuit of wisdom rather than of knowledge; and indeed what he is concerned with is not so much the object of knowledge as of intuitive perception – is scarcely susceptible of being known. Yet whether wisdom can be any more profitably pursued than happiness is a question. Certainly the few moral philosophers I have known do not seem to have been outstandingly successful in either, whereas some natural philosophers, such as Sir Humphrey Davy…’ Stephen carried on to the end of his long, his very long sentence...\n\n“teaching young gentlemen has a dismal effect upon the soul. It exemplifies the badness of established, artificial authority. The pedagogue has almost absolute authority over his pupils: he often beats them and insensibly he loses the sense of respect due to them as fellow human beings. He does them harm, but the harm they do him is far greater. He may easily become the all-knowing tyrant, always right, always virtuous; in any event he perpetually associates with his inferiors, the king of his company... Have you ever known a schoolmaster fit to associate with grown men? The Dear knows I never have. They are most horribly warped indeed”\n\n“The crackle and yield of this little paper cylinder,’ he said, holding it up, ‘gives me a sensual pleasure whose deeper origins I blush to contemplate, while the slow combustion of the whole yields a gratification that I should not readily abandon even if it did me harm, which it does not. Far from it. On the contrary, tobacco purges the mind of its gross humours, sharpens the wits, renders the judicious smoker sprightly and vivacious. And soon I shall need all my sprightliness and vivacity.”\n\n“All those officers who were not on duty went back to their game of shove-groat in the gunroom: a great competition had been going on since Malta, and although the prize of twelve and sixpence seemed trifling since the capture of the Bonhomme Richard, they still played with the greatest eagerness, as careless of the glorious sky, the perfect sea, the spectacular Ionian shore, and even of Pyrrhus and the Dalmatian pelicans as they had been in some sunless convoy, far out in the drizzling German Ocean”\n\n“in war there is neither Turk nor Christian nor moral consideration.’\n‘A war like that would not be worth fighting,’ said Jack.\n‘And yet the Dear knows war is not a game,’ said Stephen.\n‘No,’ said Jack. ‘Perhaps I should have said not worth winning”\n\n</blockquote>",

    "review": "<spoiler>\r\nWray, the titular traitor, is enjoyable. First he puts a justification into someone else's mouth - not an ignoble one:\r\n<blockquote><i>Wray laughed and said 'I remember a Frenchman who acknowledged all sorts of very grave faults in Buonaparte, including tyranny, as you so rightly say, and even worse a total ignorance of French grammar, usage and manners, but who nevertheless supported him with all his might. His argument was this: the arts alone distinguish men from the brutes and make life almost bearable - the arts flourish only in time of peace - universal rule is a prerequisite for universal peace; and here as I recall he quoted Gibbon on the happiness of living in the age of the Antonines, concluding that in effect the absolute Roman emperor, even Marcus Aurelius, was a tyrant, if only in posse, but that the pax romana was worth the potential exercise of this tyranny. As my Frenchman saw it, Napoleon was the only man or rather demi-god capable of imposing a universal empire, so on humanitarian and artistic grounds he fought in the Garde imperiale.'\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nBut then he spends the rest of the book demonstrating his total corruption and lack of principle, leading to the most iniquitous moment of the series:\r\n<blockquote><i>[French handler:] 'As for Maturin, I do have a certain indirect hold for the time being, but J am afraid it cannot last, and the moment it is gone he must be eliminated. The Dey of Mascara will answer the purpose, as you suggested before.'\r\n'Certainly,' said Wray. 'And I remember I said that the Dey might be used to kill two birds with one stone. Now I might go so far as to say three.'\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nThis refers to killing his father-in-law for the inheritance, Aubrey in revenge for a public insult, and Maturin for solid espionage reasons and gambling debt reasons. Comprehensive!\r\n</spoiler>",

But it don’t really signify, you know. Most lunatics are only shamming Abraham to get out of work; and these are not the dangerous raving kind. They don’t bite: they would not be discharged else. It stands to reason. All you have to do is put ’em in chains and flog ’em hearty in their fits, just as they do at Bedlam. Was you ever at Bedlam, Aubrey?’\n‘No, sir.’\n‘My father often used to take us. It was better than a play.’ The Admiral chuckled at the recollection and then went on.\n\n‘Pray tell the Captain that it will not do,’ said Stephen, ‘and that he will be obliged to bear up, bear down, bear away for that noble stream the São Francisco and fill our casks from its limpid, health-giving billows as they flow between banks covered with a luxuriant vegetation of choice exotics, echoing to the cries of the toucan, the jaguar, various apes, a hundred species of parrots, and they flying among gorgeous orchids, while huge butterflies of unparalleled splendour float over a ground strewn with Brazil nuts and boa-constrictors.’\n‘He was afraid you would say that’.\n\n...he had the feeling that the man’s chief emotion, now that the first shock and dismay were over, was anger – anger against the world in general and anger against her too, for being ill. It did not surprise him very much: in the course of his professional career by land he had seen many and many a husband, and even some lovers, angry at a woman’s sickness, impatient, full of blame: quite devoid of pity, and angry that it should be expected of them.\n</blockquote>\n",

Cochrane is one of these absurd Victorians doing 9 lives in one; Mary Montagu’s cynicism about a cause celebre thrills me weirdly.\n\nVery moving scene with all the old sailors turning out.\n<blockquote>‘The judges are thought of as quite great men.’\n‘By those who do not know them. And not all judges, either. Think of Coke, who so cowardly attacked the defenceless Raleigh at his trial and who was dismissed when he was chief-justice; think of all the Lord Chancellors who have been turned away in contempt for corruption; think of the vile Judge Jeffries.’\n‘God’s my life, Stephen, you are uncommon hard on lawyers. Surely there must be some good ones?’\n‘I dare say there are: I dare say there are some men who are immune to the debasing influence, just as there are some men who may walk about among those afflicted with the plague or indeed the present influenza without taking it’\n\n‘You could not truthfully blackguard the law, which is the best law that any nation was ever blessed with,’ said Lawrence, ‘but you might point out that it is administered by human beings. Some of them, indeed, can scarcely claim so high a rank.’\n\n“Stephen stood up to peer out of the window at the evening sky, and now, looking back into the room, he saw Jack in the full north light, sitting as though for his portrait. He seemed broader than before, heavier, profoundly grave of course, and somewhat leonine; but beneath the unmoved gravity Stephen perceived a wound that was hardly affected by the news of the Surprise; and in the hope of easing it to some degree he added, ‘And in the strictest confidence, my dear, I may tell you that our war will not be entirely private either. You know something of my activities; and at intervals of harrying the enemy’s commerce I may have errands of that kind to run.’ Jack took the point; he expressed his pleasure with a polite inclination of his head and the appearance of a smile; and the pain remained unaffected. Stephen continued, ‘This damned spiteful pillory, brother. It is of no essential importance to an innocent man, but it is bound to be unpleasant, like a toothache: I have given you many a draught for the toothache, so I have, and here is one’ – taking a small bottle from his pocket – ‘that will make the pillory pass like little more than a dream: disagreeable, but only faintly disagreeable, and at a distance. I have often used it myself, with great effect.’\n\n‘Thankee, Stephen,’ said Jack, setting the bottle on the mantelshelf. Stephen saw that he had no intention of taking it, and that the underlying pain was quite untouched. For to Jack Aubrey the fact of no longer belonging to the Navy counted more than a thousand pillories, the loss of fortune, loss of rank, and loss of future. It was in a way a loss of being, and to those who knew him well it gave his eyes, his whole face, the strangest look.\n\n\n</blockquote>",

Huzzay,’ making the gesture of one released from his manacles, and thus signifying that the moment the black set foot on a British ship he was no longer a slave. ‘You’ – touching his breast – ‘Free Man.’\r\n‘Parm me, sir,’ said the black, ‘my name is Smith.’ But he spoke so gently for fear of giving offence, that, in the midst of the cheerful hullaballoo, his words had no influence whatsoever upon public opinion.”.\r\n\r\n“Stephen and Davidge spoke of the difficulties of remaining alive as an undergraduate at Trinity College in Dublin: Davidge had a cousin there who had been pierced three times, twice by a sword, once by a pistol-bullet.\r\n‘I am not a quarrelsome man nor inclined to take offence,’ said Stephen, ‘yet I must have been out a score of times in my first year. It is better now, I believe, but it was a desperate place in those days.”\r\n\r\n“Could you not spend an afternoon at Milport, to meet the electors? There are not many of them, and those few are all my tenants, so it is no more than a formality; but there is a certain decency to be kept up. The writ will be issued very soon.’ Then, seeing Jack’s look of astonishment, he went on, ‘I mean to offer you the seat.’\r\n‘Do you, by God?’ cried Jack; and realizing the extent, the importance, the consequence of what his cousin had just said he went on, ‘I think that amazingly handsome in you, sir; I take it more kindly than I can say.’ He shook Mr Norton’s thin old hand and sat staring for a while: possibilities that he hardly dared name flashed and glowed in his mind like a fleet in action.\r\nCousin Edward said ‘I thought it might strengthen your hand in any dealings with government. There is not much merit in being a member of parliament, unless perhaps you represent your county; but at least a member with merit of his own is in a position to have it recognized”.\r\n\r\nTakes Stephen 40 pages and like a week to inform his wife he’s not unfaithful.

Here's him being shot at by a French frigate:\r\n<blockquote><i>Holes appeared in the topsails and courses; the tack of the mainsail, just belayed, sprang free; the balls sent water splashing from the forecastle aft; several shot up white fountains close at hand; the last shattered the larboard cathead.\r\n\r\n'Good practice for such a distance,' observed Jack.</i>\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\n[Stephen's] <i>only fear was that on hearing the news she would sell her famous great diamond, the Blue Peter, the joy of her life: for not only would doing so take away that joy but it would also give her an immense moral advantage, and Stephen was convinced that moral advantage was a great enemy to marriage. Few happy marriages did he know among his friends and acquaintance, and in those few the balance seemed to him equal. Then again he found it more blessed to give than to receive; he had a strong disinclination to being obliged; and sometimes, when he was low-spirited, he put this down to an odious incapacity for gratitude... \r\n\r\nTheir life had become a competitive martyrdom: competitive fasting, competitive holiness, competitive fortitude and self-denial, a dreadful uncomplaining cheerfulness in that ancient cold damp stony house, an intensely watchful competition that could only be won by the cousin that died first; though Cosi Eulália told him as a secret never to be divulged that she had spent all Don Ramón's presents and all her dress allowance for the last three years in prayers and Masses for her husband's spiritual welfare.</i>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<i>'A letter from Sam,' said Jack, passing the first sheet. 'How well he expresses himself - a very happy turn of phrase, upon my word. There is a message for you,' - passing the second -'And something in Greek. Pray read it all.'\r\n'How he is coming on, to be sure: he will soon be vicargeneral, at this rate. It is not Greek but Irish, and referring to my intervention with the Patriarch it says May God set a flower upon your head.'\r\n'Come, that is civil. I could hardly have put it better myself. So the Irish have a writing of their own? I had no idea.”\r\n'Certainly they have a writing of their own. They had it long before your ancestors left their dim Teutonic wood; and indeed it was the Irish first taught the English the ABC, though with indifferent success, I freely admit. Yet this is a very handsome letter, so it is.'</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Love, sorrow, and wealth are the three things that cannot be concealed: and intelligence-work comes a very close fourth.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n<i>'do you know of a Mr Bede, that wrote an ecclesiastical history?'\r\n\r\n'Bede? Bede?' said Marsden, breaking off his conversation with his neighbour. 'Never heard of him.' Then resuming it, 'He was a mere boy, so we only gave him a hundred lashes on the back, and the rest on his bottom and legs.'\r\n\r\n'Bede lived in the County Durham,' said Stephen in a momentary pause. 'Little do I or other naturalists know of the northern parts of England; but it is to be hoped that some future faunist, a person of a thinking turn of mind, a man of fortune, will undertake the tour, accompanied by a botanist and a draughtsman, and will give us an account of his journey. The manners of the wild Aborigines, their superstitions, their prejudices, their sordid way of life, will extort from him many useful reflections. And his draughtsman will portray the ruins of the great monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow, the home of the most learned man in England a thousand years ago, famous throughout the Christian world and now forgotten. Such a work would be well received.'<i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnd lastly O’Brian warns us what is to come:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>'As for an end,' said Martin, 'are endings really so very important? Sterne did quite well without one; and often an unfinished picture is all the more interesting for the bare canvas. I remember Bourville's definition of a novel as a work in which life flows in abundance, swirling without a pause: or as you might say without an end, an organized end. And there is at least one Mozart quartet that stops without the slightest ceremony: most satisfying when you get used to it.\r\n</i></blockquote>",

I do not. Your premises are mistaken and so necessarily is your conclusion.’</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n(That’s not how logic works.)\r\n\r\nThis is one of the great ironies of the series: Stephen and his colleagues, so enormously educated, so vastly respected are not doing much for their patients, except when they whack off something gangrenous. The most celebrated of Stephen’s surgeries, trepanation, is no treatment at all for head trauma (except maybe for extracting shards). He constantly lets blood. He pours mercury into syphilitics. Regression to the mean and placebo can explain all of his middling success. In this book at least we see a little bit of the truth, therapeutic nihilism:\r\n<blockquote><i>We swim in ignorance. Where these diseases are not wholly characteristic, sharply marked and obvious, they are difficult to detect; and when we have detected them there is still little we can really do. Apart from general care our only real resource is mercury in its various forms, and sometimes the remedy is worse than the disease.</i></blockquote>\r\nBut in general he has a doctor’s arrogance without a modern doctor’s powers.

I have tried to make this dish a little more palatable by adding mushrooms, our ordinary European mushrooms, Agaricus campestris, which to my perfect stupefaction I found growing here in alpine meadows: but my dear companion told me I should certainly drop down dead, his followers too assured me and one another that I should swell, then drop down dead; and it angered them so when I survived a week that Eduardo had to beg me to stop”\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\n“When we have finished breakfast – pray help yourself to bacon and pass the dish – I will show you something more extraordinary by far. Our rudder has gone by the board.’\r\n‘Oh, oh,’ cried Stephen, aghast. ‘Are we rudderless, so?’\r\n‘I will not deceive you, brother: we are without a rudder. Do you remember asking me about pintles?’ Stephen nodded, still much concerned. ‘Well, it appears that at some point in our dreadful passage through the drift-ice a great floe must have lifted the pintles off the dumb-chalder and the braces, or most of them, and destroyed the wood-locks, so that it was hanging by little more than the tiller. We did not notice it, since we barely touched the helm sailing large; but when the lightning struck the rudder-head, shattering all down to the waterline, why, it dropped clean away.’ He pointed to the shattered, blackened rudder-head, now covered by a decent cloth.\r\n‘Is there any help for such a state of affairs?’\r\n‘Oh, I am sure we shall find something,’ said Jack. ‘May I trouble you for the marmalade? Capital marmalade, you must confess; though not quite as good as Sophie’s.’\r\nStephen had often heard Jack say, when life at sea grew more trying than the human frame could bear, ‘that it was no use whining’; but he had never “seen quite this degree of insouciance, or what he felt tempted to call irresponsible levity. How much was assumed as a captain’s duty in a virtually hopeless situation? How much was Jack’s natural reaction? He was not a man much given to strike attitudes. How hopeless was the situation in fact?”\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\n“that, much nearer to us,’ said Stephen to the ecstatic Reade, ‘is what we at sea term a schooner; but you need not be afraid. She carries little in the way of guns.’\r\n‘A Baltimore clipper, sir, I believe,’ said Mr Adams.\r\n‘Indeed? I could have sworn she was a schooner, in spite of those rectangular sails in front.’\r\n‘Certainly, sir. She is certainly a schooner in rig. The clipper part refers to her hull.’\r\n‘Oh, she has a hull as well, has she? I was not aware”\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\n",

    "review": "Pretty slow, but seeing Jack tearing into the slave trade is worth a lot.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Drier it might have been, but not for those who habitually stood on the lowest of the steps on the ship's side, holding on to the entering ropes and pondering until she rolled and the sea rose, soaking him, this time farther than the waist. Stephen came aboard the Surprise dripping, as usual; and as usual Killick, worn thin and old and preternaturally shrewish by the task of looking after both the Captain and the Doctor, a feckless pair with their clothes and their limbs...\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n—\r\n\r\nOn the treatment of language delay in young children (not to say autism):\r\n<blockquote><i>'Am I not to see my own flesh and blood? My own grandniece? Believe me, Dr Maturin,' cried Mrs Williams, her voice reaching its metallic, dominant ring, 'these childish, self-willed, stubborn, obstinate fancies are best dealt with firmly: a good shaking, the black hole, bread and water and perhaps the whip answer very well and at no cost: though to be sure you are a physician and everything in that line is free.'\r\n'I should be sorry to forbid you my house,' said Stephen.'</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nO’Brian has slowly given Jack depth: his bruising by institutions, his mathematical awakening, and\r\n<blockquote><i>'Now, in the warm night, there was no one to be comforted, kept in countenance, no one who could scorn him for virtuosity, and he could let himself go entirely; and as the grave and subtle music wound on and on, Stephen once more contemplated on the apparent contradiction between the big, cheerful, florid sea-officer whom most people liked on sight but who would never have been described as subtle or capable of subtlety by any one of them (except perhaps his surviving opponents in battle) and the intricate, reflective music he was now creating. So utterly unlike his limited vocabulary in words, at times verging upon the inarticulate'</i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>he was quite remarkably defenceless when it came to dealing with jealousy. It was an emotion he had apparently never known, at least not in its present consuming state, and it was one whose nature and development he scarcely seemed to recognize at all, so that he was unable to call upon intelligence for what help it can bring in these cases.\r\n\r\nStephen was well acquainted with this blindness where health was concerned - 'It is only a lump: it will soon go away' - and affections - 'She has certainly not received my letter. The posts are so slow these days, and very far from sure' - yet even so it surprised him in Jack Aubrey, a much more intelligent man than he seemed to those who did not know him well. With great concern he had watched the progress of the disease, the changes in the atmosphere at Ashgrove Cottage, where Mr Hinksey continued to call with the most unlucky regularity, often appearing a few moments before Jack left, and the beginning of a change in the Bellona. Jack was still very kind to him...\r\n\r\n'I had been on the point of unbosoming myself... foolish, discreditable thoughts.'\r\n\r\n'I rejoice you did not, brother. The closest friendship cannot stand such a strain: the results are invariably disastrous.'</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nConversely, Stephen’s wisdom and serenity lessens. The two men are roughly equal stature in their middle years, where in youth Jack was foolish, cockbrained, naive.\r\n<blockquote><i>[Stephen] had some faults, and one was a habit of dosing himself, generally from a spirit of inquiry, as in his period of inhaling large quantities of the nitrous oxide and of the vapour of hemp, to say nothing of tobacco, bhang in all its charming varieties in India, betel in Java and the neighbouring islands, qat in the Red Sea, and hallucinating cacti in South America, but sometimes for relief from distress, as when he became addicted to opium in one form or another; and now he was busily poisoning himself with coca-leaves, whose virtue he had learnt in Peru.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>Stephen's dislike for killing his fellow-men often embarrassed Jack, whose profession it was, and he quickly added 'Of course, that is only the ideal course of events. A thousand things could throw it out</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nOne of the many interesting things about these books is the sustained depiction of people who <i>like</i> their jobs, their dangerous, difficult, uncomfortable, highly regimented jobs. Who can’t function very well at leisure, in normal free society, who flee into risky duty.\r\n\r\nAnother is the sheer number of cockups, spoonerisms, brainfarts and bullshit:\r\n<blockquote><i>'My [pulse]  is one hundred and seventeen to the minute.'\r\n'That is the luckiest number in the world, I believe; a prime number, to be divided or multiplied by no other.'\r\n'You are in the right of it, Stanislas Roche'</i></blockquote>\r\n(117/3 = 39) These still rule our lives, but at least computers mean that they could be corrected, if we noticed, if we cared.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nI was surprised at Maturin telling the peasants that Napoleon had converted to Islam - spy and assassin he might be, but I don’t remember him lying before - but it seems that he was just repeating <a href=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/12/02/mirage-paris-meets-cairo-via-napoleon/\">one of Boney’s lies</a>.",

It’s probably pretty hard for people outside the UK to understand Jack’s sentimental uneconomical Conservatism - or, since the One Nation Tories are dead and buried, even if you’re in the UK.\r\n<blockquote><i>'Jack,' said Stephen, 'I have been contemplating on your words about the nature of the majority, your strangely violent, radical, and even - forgive me - democratic words, which, with their treasonable implication of \"one man, one vote\", might be interpreted as an attack on the sacred rights of property; and I should like to know how you reconcile them with your support of a Tory ministry in the House.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, as for that,' said Jack, 'I have no difficulty at all. It is entirely a matter of scale and circumstance. Everyone knows that on a large scale democracy is pernicious nonsense - a country or even a county cannot be run by a self-seeking parcel of tub-thumping politicians working on popular emotion, rousing the mob. Even at Brooks's, which is a hotbed of democracy, the place is in fact run by the managers and those that don't like it may either do the other thing or join Boodle's; while as for a man-of-war, it is either an autocracy or it is nothing, nothing at all - mere nonsense. You saw what happened to the poor French navy at the beginning of the Revolutionary War...'\r\n\r\n'...while at the other end of the scale, although \"one man, one vote\" certainly smells of brimstone and the gallows, everyone has always accepted it in a jury trying a man for his life. An inclosure belongs to this scale: it too decides men's lives. I had not realized how thoroughly it does so until I came back from sea and found that Griffiths and some of his friends had persuaded my father to join with them in inclosing Woolcombe Common: he was desperate for money at the time. Woolcombe was never so glorious a place as Simmon's Lea, but I like it very well - surprising numbers of partridge and woodcock in the season - and when I saw it all cleared, flattened, drained, fenced and exploited to the last half-bushel of wheat, with many of the small encroachments ploughed up and the cottages destroyed, and the remaining commoners, with half of their living and all their joy quite gone, reduced to anxious cap-inhand casual labourers, it hurt my heart...’\r\n\r\n‘...what they and the bigger farmers hate is the possibility of the labourers growing saucy, as they call it, asking for higher wages - for a wage that keeps up with the price of corn - refusing to work if they do not get it, and falling back on what they can wring from the common. No common, no sauciness'</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\ni.e. Class war, but with peasants and aristos against the bourgeoisie. (Still the most popular class war? - witness the depiction of the middle class in ~any work of art of the last 60 years, where I take the new professional elite, including novelists and painters, to have replaced aristos.)\r\n<blockquote><i>Neither Harding nor Stephen had sentimental, misty views of rural poverty: they both knew too much about the squalor, dirt, idleness, petty thieving, cruelty, frequent drunkenness and not uncommon incest that could occur to have any idyllic notion of a poor person's life in the country. 'But,' said Harding, 'it is what we are used to; and with all its plagues it is better than being on the parish or having to go round to the farmer's back door begging for a day's work and being turned away. No, it ain't all beer and skittles but with the common a man is at least half his own man. And without the common he's the farmer's dog. That's why we are so main fond of Captain Jack.'</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>Stephen took his disappointment philosophically. After all, he had himself reached nearly seven years of age before he paid really serious attention to voles.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>He felt no particular guilt [for cheating on his wife] except for this foolishness [in leaving evidence]: by his code a man who was directly challenged [seduced] must in honesty engage -anything else would be intolerably insulting. Yet had he known of this miserable old woman's prying and her malice he would certainly have played the scrub in Canada.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>He revered the sound if not the full implication of the Book of Common Prayer, the Lessons and the usual psalms and readings: the other rituals such as the inspection of the entire ship and every soul aboard her, clean, shaved, sober and toeing a given line or rather seam, soothed his mind; and although today he did not feel up to reading a sermon he and all his people were pei~ectly satisfied with the even more usual Articles of War, which, through immemorial use, had acquired ecclesiastical qualities of their own.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nDiana: \r\n<blockquote><i>‘I have it on the best authority [her own] that Jack is no artist in these matters [sex]. He can board and carry an enemy frigate with guns roaring and drums beating in a couple of minutes; but that is no way to give a girl much pleasure. In better hands she would, I am sure, have been a very likely young woman; and oh so much happier.'\r\n'Clearly, you know more about these things than I.’</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nThe military-military complex:\r\n<blockquote><i>'War of course is a bad thing,' he went on. 'But it is our way of life - has been these twenty years and more - and for most of us it is our only hope of a ship, let alone of promotion: and I well remember how my heart sank in the year two, the year of the peace of Amiens. But let me offer this reflection by way of comfort: in the year two my spirits were so low that if I could have afforded a piece of rope I should have hanged myself. Well, as everyone knows that peace did not last, and in the year four I was made post, jobbing captain of Lively, and a lively time we had of it too. I throw this out, because if one peace with an untrustworthy enemy can be broke, another peace with the same fellow can be broke too; and our country will certainly need defending, above all by sea. So' - filling his glass again - 'let us drink to the paying-off, and may it be a peaceful, orderly and cheerful occasion, followed by a short, I repeat very short run ashore.'</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>The Philosophers were not a particularly ascetic body of men: few of them had ever allowed philosophy to spoil their appetites - their president weighed over fifteen stone - and they now set about their dinner with the earnestness it deserved.</i></blockquote>",

    "review": "Nearly wordless (aside from some signage, fake hieroglyphs, some possibly fake Thai, and the epilogue), so it doesn’t make sense to judge it by novelistic standards. Not much plot either, just an image stream: one long chase sequence. These are heavy constraints to work within, harder than say free verse (which gets to silently import nearly all of the sense from whatever language it chooses to wear), and it is amazing how much meaning he manages to convey. Still less than you probably need.\r\n\r\nWe cross an invisible boundary twice. We move from a Kowloon recursive shanty, chased by cops, to an eldritch snuff brothel, chased by monsters, with hallucinogens along the way muzzing reality. Horrible creatures seem to do terrible things to children, women, a scuba diver, in beautiful surroundings. The orchestrator of the monsters is beaten to death, and rises in death to violate his killer. The box man watches in horror, but can’t stop to help, has to keep moving. Then we're back in the shanty, pursued by monsters and cops and then just cops. Somehow this doesn’t feel cheap like say Maruo or most <i>guro</i> stylists. The Asia Extreme pervertedness is not the point here, and most of the surreal touches are not sexed or violent (florist with a perch-fish face, frog playing the koto), and we run past them to the sea. \r\n\r\n<i>Why</i> be grotesque? And why am I asking that instead of “why be beautiful?” Maybe: Creating beauty is its own justification; making something ugly means you need to compensate us, either in virtuosity (Nabokov’s prose, or Penderecki’s harmonics, or Ito’s linework) or in access to otherwise inaccessible thoughts or feelings. (Novelty is a common justification but I don't think it works alone.) Sakabashira pays both taxes, just about. About a third of the book is impressive double-page single panels, and the visual perspective of these big detailed places is one of the few continuities among the obscure fantasy squibs.\r\n\r\n<spoiler>The book has a clear and good allegorical reading: the box man is ferrying his senile dad to an old folk’s home / a hospice. The monsters are the ill-health, dependency, and misanthropy of decay - the chief of the monsters, dementia, devours brains. I dunno what the cheery kappa is, maybe a nurse, or the father’s old self, true self - kappas also need to return to the sea. Why cops? I take both cops and demons to be the other burdens of the son’s life, taxes and death. Compassionate leave doesn’t last long, if you get any. I don’t know why the old folk’s home is depicted as a crazy party - maybe merely not having to work anymore is ecstatic. Or what it means for cops (society, work, obligations) to kill your monsters (negativity, malice, trauma). There’s probably some connection to <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9999.The_Box_Man\">a surreal novel</a> of the same name but I can’t say. </spoiler>\r\n\r\nYou can see <i>Box Man</i> as the negation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Good_Life,_If_You_Don%27t_Weaken\">Seth</a>, where words take half of every panel, characters meet just to allow more words to come out, all value is held captive in the bubbles. It’s fair to view either extreme (wordlessness or actionlessness) as squandering the dual possibilities of comics, but in fact Seth and Sakabashira are both fine, both fleshing out parts of artistic space that don’t have to appeal to everyone, or anyone, if only they do it well.",

    "review": "Cartoon restaurant reviews for places you’ll never go. It should be boring - more than half the shots are just lo-res black and white drawings of food. But it’s not boring, because the dining is consolation for lovelessness and the sublimation of desires. \r\n<blockquote><i>listen. There are between four and six hours in the day where I am neither working or sleeping. During all of that time, I think about food. Or, depending on the work, I might spend work hours on food too. Since I’ve given that much of my life to food, don’t you think food owes me a bit of payback?</i></blockquote>\r\nYoshinaga depicts herself as a hot mess (with ultrafeminine and antifeminine, childish and elderly forms), but energetic and sincere in using food as alternative to romance. Most media seem to underestimate the sheer power and meaning of our interests (“hobbies” doesn’t serve because it connotes littleness, secondariness). How many people centre on them, instead of on families, jobs, churches?\r\n\r\nThe Japanese obsession with marriage, as sine qua non of a respectable life, is funny from where I’m standing (how Regency this country is!) but is of course no bloody fun for those trammelled into it. I don’t see it being challenged much. How did the West get over it?\r\n\r\nI liked all the foodie detail even though or because I’m no foodie. They do plate sharing, which I like the idea of but can’t imagine getting away with in most British restaurants.\r\n<blockquote><i>Apologies for the high percentage of entrails. The fact is that Y-naga would die for gizzards, hearts, and liver.</i></blockquote>\r\nThe letterer decided to contract all the names (Yoshinaga -> “Y-naga”), possibly as a legal / privacy thing. For some reason I couldn’t get used to this and got oddly aphasic over it.\r\n\r\nRead while hungry.",

    "review": "One of the main characters, Teddy, is near-catatonic for half the book. The other dialogue follows his lead, in a way, a mumblecore, time-filling, phatic bathos way. The victims aren’t articulate. The interesting bit is that the twisted Alex Jones mouthpiece is eloquent, stirring, and human sounding.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the panels look the same: indoors, with matte walls, small oblong speech bubble up top, single blank potato character in the centre, trying to communicate. Their faces have two moods, like emoticons of old. The poverty is intentional, to evoke monotony to the point of horror.\r\n\r\nIt helps to know it’s a dystopian work, by which I mean exaggerated. Not that murders don’t happen, not that many office buildings aren’t inexplicably sterile and unfit for sentient life, not that life grinds no one into catatonia, not that you don’t check your email 50 times too often, not that the bottoms of the internet haven’t caused or anyway precipitated sad mayhem already. But the world has fewer horrors now, even with Q and whatever next. if you ignore and select hard enough you can make a lot of things seem hellish, be hellish.\r\n\r\nAvoid if sad or worse.",

The show is the best depiction of my adolescence, better than <i>Dazed and Confused</i>, deeper than <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>, rawer than <i>Infinite Jest</i>, less Jesuitical and specific than <i>Portrait of the Artist</i>. Teen age is an alien smashing your head with a bass at 40 mph, and weird things climbing out of the crater. A blur, a pastiche of childhood and adulthood, a parody that thinks it’s a tragedy. Naota is exploited repeatedly, and is either indifferent or passionately glad of it. Mamimi is flat here, less pathetic and less perverse. Atomsk, the only adult in the universe, is constantly on the way and never arrives.\r\n\r\nAll the same I might have understood the show on the first watch if I’d had this. As it is I got the presentiment of awe, the IOU of a justification of an entire dumb medium.\r\n\r\n4 stars for me, probably not for you",

Probably a bit dangerous for some people.\r\n\r\nSubtlety: it's easy to view this as some kind of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/913011-the-real-trouble-with-this-world-of-ours-is-not\">critique</a> of rationalism, since his entire problem consists in excessive thought, excessive self-attention, and the narrator notes that he realised his ultimate entrapment during a mathematical logic course. But it's an impossibly naive kind, the one which insists on the \"<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/voDm6e6y4KHAPJeJX/act-utilitarianism-criterion-of-rightness-vs-decision\">criterion of rightness</a> [or correctness]\" being constantly stared at, instead of approximated and mostly obscured behind its sane heuristics. I say impossible but it is of course quite common, one of the 10 curses of major depression.\r\n\r\nDetail, probably not accidental: Neal calls his (adoptive) parents his \"step-parents\". At one remove from him.\r\n\r\n<spoiler>The end takes Neal's extraordinary recursive self-understanding / self-destruction to  higher order: before he dies, Neal imagines DFW looking at a picture of Neal after he dies, and Neal imagines DFW's inner life, which includes a heartbreakingly deluded reflection on Neal as a perfect, uncontrived popular kid, and DFW's confusion at why Neal would do it, and then Neal imagines DFW's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace#Death\">own</a> Nealian disorder, and his continuing battle with himself to maybe not let irony and pessimism ruin this one thing, <i>viz.</i> DFW's attempted imaginative sympathy for Neal.

    "review": "The cracks finally show here. It’s O’Brian’s own mourning book apparently. Still good, still fantastically subtle alongside its cannonfire (witness Lady Clifford’s reaction to children).\r\n\r\nAt one point it looks like it’ll be another genre entirely, what with the land crossings, the fearsome order of literal Assassins who must be deprived of their blood money and the triple-crossing of wily pashas.\r\n\r\nGreat fun with sailor superstitions:\r\n<blockquote><i> “There is the rope, of course. He can get half a crown an inch for a rope that hanged a right willain. And there are the clothes, bought by them that think a pair of pissed and shitten breeches …’\r\n‘Now then, Killick,’ cried Poll, ‘this ain’t one of your Wapping ale-houses or knocking-kens, so clap a stopper over that kind of talk. “Soiled linen” is what you mean.’\r\n‘… are worth a guinea, for the sake of the luck they bring. But most of all it is the Hand of Glory that makes the hangman so eager for the work. Because why? Because it too is worth its weight in gold … well, in silver.’\r\n‘What’s a Hand of Glory?’ asked the nervous voice.\r\n‘Which it is the hand that did the deed – ripped the young girl up or slit the old gentleman’s throat – and that the hangman cuts off and holds up. And our Doctor has one in a jar which he keeps secret in the cabin and looks at by night with his mate, talking very low.”\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n“Do not take me for a bloody-minded man, Stephen, a death-or-glory swashbuckling cove. Believe me, I had rather see a first-rate burnt to the waterline than a ship’s boy killed or mutilated.”\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<spoiler>The utterly abrupt death of Bonden, and the almost complete lack of public reaction to it, is too moving and outraging. 19 books of him - more depth to this tertiary character than most protagonists - and off he goes. O’Brian’s nihilistic treatment of him is the most artful moment in the book, since it gets a rise out of us while making its point. I won’t forget. All Jack allows himself is that he was “an admirable sailor”, as opposed to a devoted and comic and comically virtuous complete man.</spoiler>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i> “The doctors are going ashore,’ said Joe Plaice to his old friend Barret Bonden.\r\n‘I don’t blame them,’ said Bonden. ‘I should like to see the sights of Spalato myself. I dare say they are going to burn a candle to some saint.’\r\n‘That’s a genteel way of putting it,’ said Plaice.\r\n\r\nAt six bells in the middle watch, when all the larboard and most of the starboard guns had been drawn and reloaded with powder that Jack kept for saluting, the doctors came back. They were kindly helped up the side by powerful seamen and they crept, weary and bowed, towards their beds.\r\n‘Wholly shagged out,’ said the gunner’s mate. ‘Dear me, they can’t hardly walk.’\r\n‘Well, we are all of us human,’ said the yeoman of the sheets.” </i></blockquote>",

    "review": "The essence of manga is exaggeration. Men with swords taller than them, preteen superheroes, all kinds of bodies which couldn’t be, all kinds of facial expressions and gesticulations which didn’t exist until they memed themselves into real life. But you can exaggerate anything, it doesn’t have to be combat or sensuality. There’s one about being a better chess player, one about being a better baseball player, one about being a better farmer, one about being a better teacher. All treated with high drama, extreme closeups, and OTT declarations. War against one’s own lack of skill and character. So there is nothing inherently surprising about <i>Barakamon</i>, an exaggerated portrayal of a disgraced calligrapher and his attempt to personalise his art.\n\nCalligraphy is itself an exaggeration, paying excessive attention to a functional thing, writing. I don’t mean that as criticism: most of what’s good in the world comes because someone took something way too seriously.\n\nNaru isn’t as cute as Yotsuba, and Handa isn’t as driven or distinctive as Mashiro. Still nice, still good-looking, still the kind of heightening of the ordinary we need.",

Shame there's not one of these for every subfield of maths.\n<blockquote><i>The preliminary terror, which chokes off most fifth-form boys from even attempting to learn how to calculate, can be abolished once for all by simply stating what is the meaning – in common-sense terms – of the two principal symbols... These dreadful symbols are:\n\n(1) </i>d<i> which merely means “a little bit of.”\n\nThus dx means a little bit of x; or du means a little bit of u. Ordinary mathematicians think it more polite to say “an element of,” instead of “a little bit of.” Just as you please. But you will find that these little bits (or elements) may be considered to be indefinitely small.\n\n(2) ∫ which is merely a long S, and may be called (if you like) “the sum of.”\n\nThus ∫dx means the sum of all the little bits of x... Now any fool can see that if x is considered as made up of a lot of little bits, each of which is called dx, if you add them all up together you get the sum of all the dx's... The word “integral” simply means “the whole.”...\n\nWhen you see an expression that begins with this terrifying symbol, you will henceforth know that it is put there merely to give you instructions that you are now to perform the operation (if you can) of totalling up all the little bits that are indicated by the symbols that follow.</i></blockquote>\n\nMasterstroke!

    "review": "There you have it. One last slightly forced set of actions (Jack growing desperate, not O’Brian), one last set of terrible wounds, one last set of thirsty zoological expeditions, and out.\r\n\r\nYou feel that O’Brian could have kept it up for another 10 books without absurdity, even though he had to bend time slightly to make Napoleon last 14 books. There is admittedly nowhere for J&S to develop - they are already as open and close as such men could be. Jack withdraws during yet another antarctic horror here, saying nothing, getting no focal time, and there is no relational jeopardy; we and Stephen know it’s temporary.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i> ‘Please tell the Senhor that I have never eaten better porco in my life,' said Jack, holding up a bare white bone. Jack had a variety of little imbecilities, but none irritated Stephen more than his way of tossing in the odd word or two of a foreign language.<br>\r\n\r\n[Of Americans]: “Well, may it prosper them,' said Jack. 'Though they are little better than republicans and democrats, may it prosper them.”<br>\r\n\r\n“You are doing very well,' said Stephen in that rather loud, distinct voice that even quite intelligent medical men use to their foreign patients, 'and if Mr. Hanson will call a shipmate to make sure you do not fall, you may go up on deck for a while, now that the ship is so still”<br>\r\n\r\nA certain cloud hung over the ship. It disappeared after grog and an enormous supper of fresh seal steaks: and stupidly I did not attend to the proportion of those who were affected and those (mostly countrymen and accustomed to killing as a matter of course from childhood) who were not; yet I did notice, since we were in the same boat, that Hanson and his particular friend Daniel did what little they could to hide their distress in our many bloody voyages to and fro, with the skuas screaming just over our heads.<br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea, if it teaches nothing else, does at least compel a submission to the inevitable which resembles patience. And all those concerned contained themselves with a decent appearance of that virtue through the clear hours of approach.<br>\r\n\r\n[on authority]: Inside there were four large chests of silver and a moderate chest of gold: curiously enough they were only closed with a hasp, and on seeing their contents a soldier who had been in the Surprise said they had all risked their lives to gain this wealth and that in his opinion it should be shared out equally at once: now, now, equally and at once. His opinion was supported by several men there, but O'Higgins said, 'A fig for your opinion,' and shot him dead.<br>\r\n\r\n[nerds, FRS]: ‘A parcel of excited young women screeching aloud and agitating their persons and limbs is enough to make one retire to a monastery. Our Fellows did not present a very elevating spectacle.'\r\n'I did notice some of the Spaniards looking rather grave, and I did regret the last bowl of punch. Yet on the other hand, ours is an eminently respectable society: the Proceedings are known all over the learned world, and the men of the Isaac Newton, however bibulous on occasion, carry recommendations to the government, foreign office and universities of whatever country they visit. I do assure you, Stephen, that our connexion with them, with the Society as a whole in its most sober and learned mood, is a singular advantage to us.'\r\n'My dear, I am entirely in agreement with you, no other Fellow more: yet even so, I could wish they would not laugh; or at the least, if they are truly amused, that they would laugh like men rather than eunuchs’\r\n\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nIf you haven’t read about the <a href=“ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cochrane,_10th_Earl_of_Dundonald”>real model for Jack</a> you’re in for a treat.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nThe ending is abrupt and glad, like all his endings. It wasn’t meant to be one but there’s some indication he had no interest in ending it anyway. From book 14:\r\n<blockquote><i> 'As for an end,' said Martin, 'are endings really so very important? Sterne did quite well without one; and often an unfinished picture is all the more interesting for the bare canvas. I remember Bourville's definition of a novel as a work in which life flows in abundance, swirling without a pause: or as you might say without an end, an organized end. And there is at least one Mozart quartet that stops without the slightest ceremony: most satisfying when you get used to it.</i></blockquote>",

She switches between half a dozen styles (crayon, smudged charcoal, heavy pencil, what looks like felt tip with most of the panel untouched, simulating intense white light, scraped acrylic abstract landscapes) with no clear meaning. There are ghosts everywhere (the people you remember, the ones you wish were here). Everyone is bitter, dishonest, haranguing except the wee girl. Also melodrama, but bad luck in love does that to people. Niki’s tiny beaming gestures are the best bit. The weird shuffling makes it seem like a diary - you don’t need to introduce anyone in your diary or mention them more than once or for more than 3 panels. But then it’s a memoir where you also show your cheating lover with his ex while you’re still back at home, and don’t make much effort to sketch his inner life and show him telling you lies you can’t disprove…\r\n\r\n(The lover is thanked in the Acknowledgments, so maybe they’re just radically open about their vices with each other, and explain their deceptions. This would be an odd pairing of vice and virtue: vicious enough to cheat and manipulate and lie, secure and honourable enough to admit it and accept your own shit)\r\n\r\nShe doesn’t spare herself much - shown lovelorn and ineffectual, a dupe who finishes the book falling for more of GM’s lies.\r\n\r\nOverall it leaves a mucky feeling, and besides the style switching there’s not much to set it above your average experimental indie bit.",

What a terrible legacy!)\n\nMany of these would be great capital-a Art if he only hadn't plastered \"TRUTH\" or \"<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/69/fe/48/69fe48e186f4d7b94e8a30816c240705.jpg\">DRUG HABIT</a>\" or \"SLAVERY\" all over the <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2d/96/22/2d9622192415df266fac88870f3dabce.jpg\">clear symbols</a> he was using for those things. But this absolute sincerity is part of the power, for all that leaden hearts like mine cringe at it. Hallucinatory moral clarity.\n\nIt's incoherent because he has a lot of standard booster capitalist views (like envy [of the rich] as the worst of all vices and <a href=\"https://locustmoon.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/mccay_tomorrow.jpg\">Captain of Industry</a> glory) and a lot of <a href=\"https://guliverlooks.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/winsor-mccay16.jpg\">standard</a> Christian socialist views (like wealth costing you your soul, like <a href=\"https://larrysanger.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/knowledge-1024x420.jpg\">advertising</a> and entertainment as evil rather than silly). There are a couple of slightly unnerving evangelical rapture panels. You could explain this by him just playing up to his current clients' ideology, cynically. But I hope he contained all of this nonsense. \n\nBut ignore all that: he <i>gets</i> it. He gets what human history was like, and what the filthy and <a href=\"https://dyn1.heritagestatic.com/lf?set=path%5B1%2F2%2F6%2F2%2F0%2F12620965%5D&call=url%5Bfile%3Aproduct.chain%5D\">nasty</a> urban industrial accumulation is <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Winsor_McCay_indian_city.png\"><i>for</i></a>. All writing is an entry in the Great Conversation, and all actual work (not rent-seeking) is part of the great project. One of his running motifs is the farmer bent cropping as an inset. Most of my contemporaries don't get it like McCay gets it, even though it's fucking obvious, as it was not in 1910. \n\nHe's also surprisingly <a href=\"https://locustmoon.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/mccay-remorse.jpg\">metal</a>. Again, his moral and political feelings are so strong that they produce a presentiment of metal's extremes. Actually I think this extremity, this early, is the most impressive part. For all that it had to be cloaked in pieties and Hearst editorialising.\n\nI've been reading comics all year and McCay is one of only a couple of artists who make me stop in my tracks, who force their whole mind onto the page.",

    "review": "Didactic, but I’m not sure I could do any better, manage to have less exposition, while writing for a general audience. I liked the details, like asteroid minerals crashing the market, or monopolism as a response to price gouging, or how structurally dangerous it’d be for Supes to lift a plane, and the infinite energy crank actually being a relatively low yield project with extremely high plant costs.\n\n<blockquote><i> People made jokes about Superman endlessly turning a crank at a constant speed in a basement somewhere. The problem was that the real issues in the world of energy were ones of transmission and distribution. MoSI had spent tens of thousands of manhours on what was internally dubbed “The Crank Problem”, trying to make sense of the math and engineering, some of which wasn’t just engineering, but theoretical engineering, and some of the theoretical engineering was meta-theoretical engineering, where the engineers were trying to figure out what kind of costs would be involved in doing enough research that there would be a practical underpinning necessary to try doing something that worked in theory but had never actually been tried.</i></blockquote>\n\nThe implicit critique of EA is dramatically satisfying but not in my top 5 critiques: that naively focussing on first-order consequences makes you manipulable by bad actors bearing silly extremist cost-benefit analyses.",

    "review": "Not as conservative as the title implies. It is all-military, but it’s the lions-led-by-donkeys variety. It avoids all the grave errors of mil SF: dehumanising the other side, failing to show our protagonists making mistakes, glorifying violence, glorifying leaders. \r\n<blockquote><i>Many genuinely blamed the Chinese in every respect; to them, America was righteous; if America was in a war, it must be a just war.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt is still not cynical enough, even as it shows the imperialism of the American executive and the silly jingoism of more than half the country.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>“I programmed the firing pattern, sent the kinetics into their hull. One hundred and fifty people on the Paltus, right?”\r\n“About that,” Neil nodded.\r\n“They all had mothers and fathers, and my God, Neil, some of them probably had kids! I might have made orphans, just like I was.”\r\n“I helped make them, too.”\r\n“I know,” she said, staring off into space. “We all did. You solved the problem. I fired the weapons. All we can do is fall back on the idea that it’s our duty. We have to trust our officers and commanders, all the way up to the president. All I can tell myself is that it was a necessary act to defend the Constitution and protect the people of the United States. But … I didn’t ever see the people we killed. I suppose that’s different from your experience.”\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere’s a likeable stodgy moral air to it, maybe Lumpkin’s religion idk.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i> “Missile flechettes ripped into the Hangzhou’s CIC, cutting into the weapons consoles and the men and women at them.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nRecommended to me for its extremely accurate space combat. (Laser frequencies, the rationale for exoskeletons, waste-heat buildup as core tactical problem). \r\n\r\n<blockquote><i> When the San Jacinto was thrusting – which was most of the time – “down” was toward the drive, giving the ship’s interior a layout like a tower, with multiple, narrow decks. From the crew’s perspective, the ship was perpetually headed up, toward a location above their heads. San Jacinto’s usual cruise thrust was ten milligees and change, enough so something dropped would eventually hit the floor, but below the threshold of providing any sensation of weight?</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nHis 2100s are probably not weird enough though. And there are wormholes and some other barely physical conveniences (helium-3 as economical fusion material). Overall it reads as an Exercise, an etude, a slightly hollow extrapolation of a world with some nice archetypes running around inside it.",

    "review": "Breezy but also contrived somehow. So like Bill Bryson: always on the lookout for an obscure fact and a dad joke. \r\n\r\nThe premise is completely sublime: the collision of the natural and artificial, the amoral and moral, the obligate and voluntary. The tragicomedy of human dominion, at this tech level. A couple of the anecdotes pay off:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>The case is detailed in an unusual 1906 book, The Criminal Prosecution and Capital Punishment of Animals. When I first paged through it, I wondered if it might be an ambitious hoax. Here were bears formally excommunicated from the Church. Slugs given three warnings to stop nettling farmers, under penalty of “smiting”…\r\n\r\nWe have writs of ejectment issued to rats and thrust into their burrows. From a 1545 complaint brought by vintners against a species of greenish weevil, we have not only the names of the lawyers but early examples of that time-honored legal tactic, the stall. As far as I could tell, the proceedings dragged on eight or nine months—in any case, longer than the life span of a weevil.\r\n\r\n… an epidemic of car break-ins at Yosemite campgrounds. Between 2001 and 2007, eleven hundred automobiles were broken into by bears… It turned out that fewer than five bears—sows and their cubs—were behind the break-ins. This is typical. From the start of the year to the September of my visit, bears in Snowmass have broken into houses through unlocked doors or windows sixty times. Wildlife-camera images have implicated just four bears. A bear research scientist with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Dave Garshelis, told me about a call he got from a National Guard camp where bears were raiding pallets of military rations called MREs, which bears apparently enjoy more than soldiers do. He was told that around a hundred bears were raiding the supplies. “The guy said, ‘I’ll bring you to this place where you look across to this ridge that is completely pockmarked with bear dens.’ I was like, ‘This sounds cool.’ ” The “dens” turned out to be natural landscape features, and “a hundred bears” in fact was three.\r\n\r\nThese elephants were not in the intention to kill,” Officer Raj says. How does he know? Because the bodies were in one piece. “If an elephant is in an angry mode, the body will not be intact. It will get in pieces.” A book by Jayantha Jayewardene includes a list of the nine recorded methods by which an angry or musth-addled elephant has killed a human being. “Placing a fore foot on one limb of the victim and ripping off the other with the trunk” is number 3. (Elephants use a similar anchor-and-pull technique to strip an uprooted shrub of limbs and leaves to eat.) Rulers of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in the 1600s were said to have taken advantage of this natural behavior, training elephants to serve as executioners.\r\n\r\n“The past decade has seen a minor epidemic of people plummeting from balconies because of monkeys. I found news accounts of six deaths in the last three years alone. Most famously, there was the 2007 fall of Delhi deputy mayor S. S. Bajwa. While taking the air, Bajwa was startled by a group of macaques set on storming the house to look for food. As he tried to stop them—or get away from them (there were no eyewitnesses)—he lost his footing and hurtled over the railing”\r\n\r\nCrow-bombing, in fact, was a government-sponsored conservation effort. Who oversaw the bombing deaths of 250,000 Illinois crows during the winter of 1935? The Illinois conservation commissioner.\r\n\r\nBecause the birds were many, the cost of ammunition high, and the admiral budget-minded, the initial assault was done without guns. It took place in 1941 and is detailed in a Fish and Wildlife Service Special Scientific Report, under the heading “Large Scale Elimination Experiment.” Two hundred men carrying lengths of pipe or wooden clubs “spent 6 or 7 hours a day” hitting albatrosses on the back of the head. An estimated eighty thousand birds were killed... “The birds,” Hubert wrote in his memoir, “mostly sat quietly in place until clubbed.” Mable’s tapes captured only “the crack of ash on skulls” and, at one point, the distress cry of a young sailor: “I didn’t join the Navy to crush the heads of innocent birds.”\r\n\r\nStill, neither Julie nor Sarah would say that gulls, as a species, are dickish.\r\n\r\nShaun makes his living from tourism but is by avocation closer to a naturalist. I don’t know the precise parameters of that calling, but I think that if you find yourself applying the word impressive to any variety of animal one.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nBut too much of the rest is dull travelogue and forced dovetails. Rather than track the sublime nonsense of concrete nature meeting abstract legality, she spends almost all of it hanging with scientists and forest officials, learning some words and spotting some danger. There is little law in it, nor in the topic: instead, ecology and popular opinion determine the creatures’ fate. Here’s the kind of ingenious foolishness I had hoped for a book of, the gerrymandering of morals in the face of an unreformable enemy you don’t have the heart to eradicate:\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>India’s top agricultural pests also happen to be sacred animals. Elephants represent the deity Ganesh, and monkeys, Hanuman. The wild boar is an avatar of Vishnu. The nilgai, or blue bull, is actually an antelope, but gai means cow, and cows are sacred. When state officials wanted to begin culling the animal, they first pushed through a name change. Nilgais are now roj, or “forest antelope.”\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nSome pretty irresponsible discussion about ricin.\r\n\r\nWas surprised when she said she had grandkids; her energetic, relentlessly informal, lulz driven escapades make her sound half her age.\r\n<blockquote><i>In a lush tropical environment, a bait has to be extremely tempting† to compete with the natural food sources. Aaron hands me a bottle of Goodnature bait, a chocolatey-coconutty goo that smells, but does not taste, delicious. It’s like eating suntan lotion, I tell Aaron.\r\n“You tried it?” His look combines horror, confusion, and pity. “You want some gum?”\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis seems wrong, from my long experience:\r\n<blockquote><i>people like me want to have their hamburgers. Only once or twice a year, I want to say. But I know that’s a lame defense. It’s not the quantity that matters, it’s the statement you make or don’t make. When you tell people you don’t eat beef—or would never use a glue trap—you make the alternative a little less comfortable for them.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nMaybe if you’re the first vegetarian anyone’s ever met, and if you’re notably charming and undogmatic. But that’s an increasingly rare service.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy am I disappointed at this being a perfectly good pop science book? Because the pop law book scarcely exists. It still has a dozen things worth quoting, that you can’t find in any other secondary text, and that’s rare enough for 3 stars.",

    "review": "I've been putting off reading this for 8 years, and sadly I was right to. The magic has gone, in two senses. The jokes are flat, the theme repetitive, the jokes repetitive or failed callbacks across the series (nobless obligay). Severe shortage of his inspired similes. The theme is Progress, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenchantment\">Disenchantment</a>, and I have loved Pratchett's human view on it, when it was subtler.\n\nFar too many cameos, in the pure sense of \"hey I member them\". Perhaps self-consciously a final encore. Far too many rushed innovations, filling in British trainspotter culture in a rush.\n\nThere's yet another species to emancipate and, harder, to normalise. The goblins are the nerd race, apparently: clever and smelly and hunted for sport. This looks glib, compared to say the manumission of the golem-slaves, but then nerdiness is an understudied element in the unfinished industrial revolution and the nature of the modern world.\n<blockquote><i>Their scruffy little faces were wreathed in smiles at the sight of something metallic and complicated. It was a sign of the times, he thought, and it looks like time for the goblins. \n</i></blockquote>\nThe villains are also a repeat from \"Thud\", except even harder to empathise with. Terrorism is quite modern. Here we have religious fundamentalists as mere idiots:\n<blockquote><i>Ardent had followers, stupid followers, and he also had powerful friends. And that was it. Politics. Politics was like those little wooden sliding-pictures games for children: you had to move all of the pieces in the hope of finding a place where the whole picture slotted together.\n</i></blockquote>\nThe counterattack against the grags is one of the few instances I can remember where the violence is just violence, unlamented.\n\nThe general Weberian disenchantment of the later Disc is undermined by the steam engine itself having sentience. This is consistent with <i>Small Gods / Moving Pictures / Soul Music</i>, where mass belief in an idea gives birth to a quasi-real egregore.\n\nAt the same time that the wizards - the singular wielders of absolute power - are being sidelined, Vetinari is shrinking. He is still tyrant here, but his viciousness is pathetic, limited to reflexive sarcasm and insisting on a pet project train line. Actually Pratchett's retaining Vetinari the benevolent despot into the Victorian age of the Disc is quite edgy and rich. Despite his protests, Ankh-Morpork is not London, not New York: it's Singapore, or Kowloon. Human rights without democracy; economic freedom without representation. At the end, the Disc is completely modern - apart from the government! I don't have a good theory of whether this is unrealistic. \n\nThe gag is that Vetinari is benevolent while being an assassin and a torturer, a fearsome, malevolent altruist. But he hasn't been conspicuously violent in 10 books and here he's a cipher, a shrugging habitual snarker.\n\nI was surprised to see Pratchett include (in an aside by an extra) the anti-globalisation McWorld viewpoint: progress as destroying something.\n<blockquote><i>He wasn’t a philosopher and couldn’t even spell the word, but the voice of the goblin officer rang in his head. He thought, what would happen if goblins learned everything about humans and did everything the human way because they thought it was better than the goblin way? How long would it be before they were no longer goblins and left behind everything that was goblin, even their pots? The pots were lovely, he’d bought several for his mum. Goblins took pots seriously now, they sparkled, even at night, but what happens next? Will goblins really stop taking an interest in their pots and will humans learn the serious, valuable and difficult and almost magical skill of pot-making? Or will goblins become, well, just another kind of human? And which would be better?\n\n  And then he thought, maybe a policeman should stop thinking about all this because, after all, there was no crime, nothing was wrong … and yet in a subtle way, there was. Something was being stolen from the world without anybody noticing or caring. \n</i></blockquote>\nThe solution to this true sighing is to note that cultures are for people, and that if people freely choose to leave a culture behind, up to the last member, then we have gained more than we lost. \n\nAnyway. The Discworld remains the most nourishing and loveable way to show young people the key to human history and to humane ends.",

    "review": "An awaited book; in fact I awaited it before I knew it was being written. Here is one of the most important people to ever live, and what notice do we take? Before now: One bad old biography (and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29506.Prisoner_s_Dilemma\">one-third</a> of another) and many gigantic maths monographs. Such yawning gaps come from historians and biographers being obsessed with artists instead - consider the nine Jane Austen biographies published in the last 11 years - and our scientists being inarticulate at best. unable or unwilling to stand up for themselves, and unrepresented by the chattering classes. (But a handful of scientists are great writers: Feynman and Dyson and Dawkins and Crick and Pascal and yeah Einstein is quotable and I was actually boggling at some of Gödel’s aphorisms just the other day. Boltzmann is funny.)\r\n\r\nIt is incredibly difficult to cover everything von Neumann did - everything he did for the first time in history - even just everything with vast practical consequences which are still felt 60 years later. \r\n\r\nChapter 2: fixing set theory where Hilbert and Russell failed\r\nChapter 3: unifying matrix and wave theory where Dirac bodged and others failed\r\nChapter 4: solution to a profound engineering challenge which changed the world forever\r\n\r\nGreat philosophers get several kinds of books written about them - two are the Life, and the intellectual biography, which actually tries to explain and show the development of their ideas. Bhattacharya’s is more like the latter plus a smattering of parties, fast cars, and intellectual bitching.\r\n\r\nHodges is, in 600pp, just able to enumerate Turing's achievements. Bhattacharya, in 284, is not even vaguely able to begin doing this for vN. Almost no mention of his great work in group theory.\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\nVery incomplete list of von Neumann’s achievements:\r\n\r\n* <i>Foundations of maths</i>: Paradox-free foundation of set theory with classes (superceded Russell)\r\n* <i>Physics</i>: Unification of matrix mechanics and wave mechanics (superceded Dirac)\r\n* <i>Physics:</i>: proof of the Ergodic hypothesis\r\n* <i>Lots of group theory</i>, chiefly operator algebras\r\n* <i>Foundations of QM</i>: axiomatisation of QM, unified wave and matrix mechanics.\r\n* <i>Physics:</i> Clarified the measurement problem (for the first time?)\r\n* <i>Physics:</i>: Central work on the Copenhagen interpretation \r\n* <i>Physics / logic</i> Founded quantum logic\r\n* <i>Economics</i>: Proved existence and uniqueness of general equilibrium \r\n* <i>Physics:</i> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09305 \">Much-misunderstood constraint on all hidden variable theories</a>. Maybe gappy.\r\n* <i>linear programming</i>: duality and the first interior point method.\r\n* <i>Fluid dynamics</i>: Fat Man implosion lens design. Discovery of the airburst efficiency. Many solutions in blast waves.\r\n* </i>Hardware engineering:</i> Redesigned the ENIAC to be the first stored program computer\r\n* </i>Computer engineering:</i>  Earliest partial design of a modern computer. Lifted lots from Mauchly and Eckert (uncredited) but greatly superceded them.\r\n* Patent busting on the digital computer design. Free for all.\r\n* Minimax and dozens of central results in game theory\r\n* Founded <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem\">utility theory</a>\r\n* Marrying neuroscience and computer science forever\r\n* Founded automata theory\r\n* <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7530868-theory-of-self-reproducing-automata\">Intelligence explosion as x-risk</a>\r\n* …\r\n\r\nBhattacharya mentions [EDIT: covers] about half of these.\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\n* The most important question in all of education: How did Hungary produce so many geniuses? Why did they stop? von Neumann’s own answer was the empire’s weird mix of 1) tolerance and rewards for Jewish people, while 2) still being extremely volatile and so making them uncertain how long this would last and so rushing to succeed.\r\n\r\n* Bhattacharya’s informalisation of the technical results here is impressive. At least one fuckup though: on p112 he confuses completeness for correctness.\r\n\r\n* At one point AB ties the Hilbert and Gödel work to modernism. Modernist mathematics, the rejection of the past, the flight into abstraction and rigour. As if this was a general spirit. I don’t know how to evaluate this idea.\r\n\r\n* Sad to hear that a heavily modified ENIAC executed a stored program two months before the Manchester Baby. I hate to see the Man win over the garage nerds.\r\n\r\n* Nash is nasty, well before he goes psychotic (self-aggrandising, straw Vulcan, racist). He makes von Neumann look soft and warm.\r\n\r\n* Lovelace is not the first programmer. Klári von Neumann has a much better claim, if we insist on ignoring Babbage.\r\n\r\n* So many brilliant people here, and far more obscure than JvN. Shapley, Barricelli, Collbohm, Goldstine, Harsanyi, McCarthy, Adele and Klári…\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\nWe tend to deify people, and they never deserve it. What did von Neumann get wrong?\r\n\r\n<b>Mutually Assured Destruction</b>\r\nIt's not obvious that this was a mistake - we're still here, MAD is a strong reason not to intentionally nuke people. But the sheer number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls\">near misses</a> and the overall estimate of <a href=\"https://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/blog/post/less-hollywood-more-car-crash\">0.1%</a> annual state risk, should make us think that the strategy was actually poor, that we are walking selection bias. \r\nThe less obvious response is that he knew all that and was trading some existential risk to block the Soviet Empire's anti-human practices from taking over. Since this argument also works for the Soviets, or for any value system which values itself, he seems to have settled for an appalling equilibrium. Tragedy of the value lock-in commons.\r\n\r\nVN wanted cooperation, wanted a long life for humanity. But he couldn’t trust enough not to escalate. The true altruist cannot afford to cooperate simply.\r\n\r\n<b>First strike on the Soviets</b>\r\n<blockquote><i>If you say 'why not bomb them tomorrow', I say, why not today? If you say 'today at five o'clock', I say why not one o'clock?</i></blockquote>(He recanted this a couple of years later.)\r\n\r\nThe mistake was twofold: to assume that the Soviets would continue growing, and to assume that the nuclear taboo would not hold. That taboo, that tradition is one of the most precious things in the world, and almost nothing is worth breaking it. To which you reply: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism#Estimated_number_of_victims\">100 million people</a> are not worth it? To which I can only apologise and suggest that 100 million are not worth 300 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Trusting Klaus Fuchs</b>\r\nHe actually handed the Soviets a new nuke design through the infamous Fuchs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNonerror: <b>\"Proof\" of no hidden variables</b>\r\nThe conventional view is that von Neumann screwed up his no-hidden-variables proof,  claimed to have shown the impossibility of hidden variables, and that this convinced everyone until Bell came along and exposed the error (30 years after Grete Hermann did it and was ignored). But <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0499\">this</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09305.pdf\">misrepresents the proof</a>, which just says that a hidden variables theory will have to have a certain weird structure (which Bohmian mechanics does).\r\n\r\n<b>Targeting Kyoto</b>\r\nI don't know if a nuclear strike on Japan was ultimately for the best (considering the appalling toll of the Pacific theatre on both sides, the likely larger toll of taking Honshū, and the second-order effects of showing the world that everything had changed). But that they were <i>civilian</i> strikes seems completely gratuitous. Striking Kyoto, the spiritual centre, in particular seems incredibly high risk.\r\n\r\nNonerror: <b>The brain is digital</b>\r\nPeople act like he was naive about the brain as computer, but he just wasn’t:\r\n<blockquote><i>the brain can prima facie be considered as a digital computer. However, upon further reflection, some elements of analog computing (e.g., the chemistry) will also become relevant in understanding the functioning of the brain.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b>The von Neumann bottleneck</b>\r\nThe world standard architecture for computers leads to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture#Von_Neumann_bottleneck\">a huge waste of CPU cycles</a>, waiting for memory. This wasn't such a big deal in the 50s, but CPU performance has masssively outpaced bus bandwidth over the last 70 years.\r\n\r\n<b>Against high-level programming</b>\r\n'von Neumann opposed the development of assemblers and high-level language compilers. He preferred to employ legions of human programmers (mostly low-paid graduate students) to hand-assemble code into machine language. “It is a waste of a valuable scientific computing instrument”, von Neumann reportedly said, “to use it to do clerical work.”.'\r\n\r\n<b>Various dumb personal risks</b>\r\nHe did not live like someone who understood expected utility and hyperbolic discounting. He ate way too much, drove incredibly badly, was an easy mark for salesmen, pissed off his wife by leching. He spent a lot of time travelling to government meetings. He let others profit from his inventions. These imply irrationality - or a surprising lack of interest in his own wealth, longevity, time use, or marriage. <a href=\"https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com/2019/10/26/some-notes-on-von-neumann-as-a-human-being/\">This post collects other apparently bad decisions.</a>\r\n\r\n—-",

    "review": "vroooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom\r\n\r\nOne of the few machines I love (despite always going on about how machines are as distinctively human and at least as expressive of deep values as paintings or concertos).\r\n\r\nThey built 32 of them; 12 of them crashed. That looks absurdly poor, but it represents 11 thousand hours flying at Mach 3, over thirty years service. And only one death somehow.\r\n\r\nThis book is dry and rote, the prose of a man who has written sixty years of memos and nothing else. Worth it for the hilarious, terrifying deadpan of some of the pilots. Bill Weaver:\r\n<blockquote><i>Without proper scheduling, disturbances inside the inlet could result in the shock wave being expelled forward—a phenomenon known as an “inlet unstart”... An immediate unstart occurred on the right engine, forcing the aircraft to roll further right and start to pitch up. I jammed the control stick as far left and forward as it would go.\r\nNo response. I instantly knew we were in for a wild ride.\r\nI attempted to tell Jim what was happening and to stay with the airplane until we reached a lower speed and altitude. I don’t think the chances of surviving an ejection at Mach 3.18 and 78,800 ft. were very good. However, g-forces built up so rapidly that my words came out garbled and unintelligible, as confirmed later by the cockpit voice recorder... Everything seemed to unfold in slow motion. I learned later the time from event onset to catastrophic departure from controlled flight was only two to three seconds. Still trying to communicate with Jim, I blacked out, succumbing to extremely high g-forces.\r\nThen the SR-71... literally disintegrated around us...\r\nBefore the breakup, we’d started a turn in the New Mexico-Colorado-Oklahoma-Texas border region. The SR-71 had a turning radius of about a hundred miles at that speed and altitude, so I wasn’t even sure what state we were going to land in...\r\nExtracting myself from the parachute harness, I discovered the source of those flapping-strap noises heard on the way down. My seat belt and shoulder harness were still draped around me, attached and latched. The lap belt had been shredded on each side of my hips, where the straps had fed through knurled adjustment rollers. The shoulder harness had shredded in a similar manner across my back. The ejection seat had never left the airplane; I had been ripped out of it by the extreme forces, seat belt and shoulder harness still fastened. I also noted that one of the two lines that supplied oxygen to my pressure suit had come loose, and the other was barely hanging on...\r\nParts were scattered over an area approximately fifteen miles long and ten miles wide. Extremely high air loads and g-forces, both positive and negative, had literally ripped Jim and me from the airplane. Unbelievably good luck is the only explanation for my escaping relatively unscathed from that disintegrating aircraft.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after the accident, I was back in an SR-71, flying the first sortie on a brand-new bird...</i></blockquote>",

    "review": "Sterling is broad. He's most famous for techno body horror, but his historical fantasies and economic stories are distinct and equally good. In fact I think his Exotic (But Non-Japanese) Cyberpunk is probably his key style. Here’s his Balkan SF, roadside kiosk as vanguard of the future:\r\n<blockquote><i>These strangers and foreigners expressed odd, truncated, malformed ideas of what he had been doing. Because they were the Voice of History.\r\n\r\nHe himself had no such voice to give to history. He came from a small place under unique circumstances. People who hadn’t lived there would never understand it. Those who had lived there were too close to understand it. There was just no understanding for it. There were just…the events. Events, transitions, new things. Things like the black kiosks…\r\n\r\nTo the neighborhood, to the people, he was a crippled, short-tempered old landlord. To her, the scholar-bureaucrat, he was a mysterious figure of international significance. Her version of events was hopelessly distorted and self-serving. But it was a version of events. </i></blockquote>\r\nThis stuff is harder than it looks. Witness the many laughably dated K00L stories of the 90s. (Gibson.) This is dated, but it's not the tech or the slang that does it. It's the excitement about the internet as ontological shift, about cultural hybridisation, postmodern whoah; also the urgent grappling with Islamic philosophy and politics. (I shouldn't say 'dated'; matured.)\r\n\r\nSterling prefigures half of recent SF. We have a grand, mindless, terrifyingly efficient foil (a la Watts), a profiteering parasite civ (Pohl, Vinge), a genetically labile bodysnatcher (Tchaikovsky, Corey), early modern magic realism (Chiang, Borges), colonialism and cosmopolitanism as the original first contact (Stephenson), Western ideology as alien (Chiang), a paean to the technician and the technologist (Stephenson, Gibson), antihuman technologies (Gibson, Stross, Watts), even boringly transcendent evaporation as natural endpoint of conscious life (Banks). Sterling feels like a skeleton key for the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe Shaper stories are nasty - one notch short of body horror, three notches past psychological horror, economic horror: I love it. Looking for one line to catch his essence I plumped for\r\n<blockquote><i>Tons of predigested fungal pap went into the slick blind jaws at one end.</i></blockquote>\r\nThen\r\n<blockquote><i>“This urge to expand, to explore, to develop, is just what will make you extinct.

Within a thousand years—perhaps a little longer—your species will vanish.”\r\n“You intend to destroy us, then? I warn you it will not be an easy task—”\r\n“Again you miss the point… Do you suppose that fragile little form of yours—your primitive legs, your ludicrous arms and hands, your tiny, scarcely wrinkled brain—can contain all that power? Certainly not! Already your race is flying to pieces under the impact of your own expertise. The original human form is becoming obsolete. Your own genes have been altered, and you, Captain-Doctor, are a crude experiment. In a hundred years you will be a relic. In a thousand years you will not even be a memory. Your race will go the same way as a thousand others.” \r\n…\r\n\r\nStone-faced children wandered aimlessly through suburban halls, dazed on mood suppressants. Precious few dared to care any longer. Sweating Marketeers collapsed across their keyboards, sinuses bleeding from inhalants. Women stepped naked out of commandeered airlocks and died in sparkling gushes of frozen air.

It's about the communitarian appeal, and the individualist appeal.\r\n<blockquote><i>“Here at least people really care and watch over each other…”\r\nShe gritted her teeth. “Watching. Yes, always.” </i></blockquote>\r\n It's a presumptive decoding of Malay culture. (“<i>The Bruneians, like Malays everywhere, adored ghost stories.</i>”) It's a great love story, a modern romance, a particular male romance. One character, initially depicted as decrepit and ridiculous, turns out to be a revolutionary colossus. Turner makes a grand conversion to human-centred technology, Gross National Happiness kind of stuff - and then this conversion is immediately subverted. The plot is driven by conveniences and I don't care at all. \r\n\r\nThe women worked on, wrapped in the lamp’s mild glow. Innocently, they enjoyed themselves, secure in their usefulness. Yet Turner knew machines could have done the sewing faster and easier. Already, through fishing smacks, as he watched, some corner of his mind pulled the task to computerized pieces, thinking: simplify, analyze, reduce.\r\n\r\nBut to what end?… People in the West talked about the “technical elite”—and Turner knew it was a damned lie. Technology roared on, running full-throttle on the world’s last dregs of oil, but no one was at the wheel, not really… “The “technical elite” were errand boys. They didn’t decide how to study, what to work on, where they could be most useful, or to what end. Money decided that. Technicians were owned by the abstract ones and zeros in bankers’ microchips, paid out by silk-suit hustlers who’d never touched a wrench. Knowledge wasn’t power, not really, not for engineers. There were too many abstractions in the way. </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n(Why is eight million regarded as a fortune of global renown though? Eight million what? CAD??)\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\n‘<i>Magic Shop</i>’ is great fun. Initially it looks like a great gag: a fantasy protagonist with no interest in mysteries, treasures, princesses, vengeance, or Journeys.\r\n\r\nLater:\r\n<blockquote><i>O’Beronne gave him a poisonous glare. “You’re a hundred and forty years old. Hasn’t the burden of unnatural life become insupportable?”\r\nJames looked at him, puzzled. “Are you kidding?” </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nA couple of these stories make me queasy. This is hard to do!\r\n\r\nPart of this is Sterling's habit of having horrible narrators. One is an Islamist assassin, and his ideology is so galling because it is not only false (e.g. Western perfidy in Iran). I realised only halfway through that the old label for Sterling was \"postmodern\". It says something that that label has become so marginal and forgettable in the last 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?25873\">Starlitz</a> stories are particularly strong. Starlitz is like Stross' Manfred Macx - an agent of the future - but in a curious amoral way. He runs guns for the Russian mafia and for psychotic Finnish nationalists. He lusts over trends and capital and flashy collectibles. He embodies the future <i>but not progress</i>: change in a nonmoral sense.\r\n\r\nThe undergrad revolutionary Aino is very tragic. Her mind is totally consumed by post-Marxist revolutionary fervour - but Marxism without hope, the nationalist perversion of the International. I recognise her, her inhumane mind-killed purity. it breaks my heart.\r\n<blockquote><i>I I envy her historical experience so much. There’s something so direct and healthy and physical about hijacking planes. </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n'Maneki Neko' is an exquisite portrait of networks, the gift economy, and another sweet vision of a kind of digital culture we haven't gotten yet. Replace money with a terrible god who can solve the problem of double coincidence. Also the brutality and inexorability of '<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/\">Elua</a>'. (The cat thing is also an egregore, of course. How better to overthrow a government than to charm literally everyone and destroy its tax base?)\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\nExcellent pastiche of cranks (Prigogine is an antishibboleth):\r\n<blockquote><i>I sniffed at the phenethylamine, the body’s own “natural” amphetamine. I felt suddenly dizzy, as if the space inside my head were full of the red-hot Ur-space of the primordial de Sitter cosmos, ready at any moment to make the Prigoginic leap into the “normal” space-time continuum, the Second Prigoginic Level of Complexity… \r\n\r\n“We’re past the Marxist thing,” said Khoklov, warming to his theme as the pill took hold. “Now it’s different. This time Russia has a kind of craziness that is truly big enough and bad enough to take over the whole world. Massive, total, institutional corruption: Top to bottom: Nothing held back. A new kind of absolute corruption that will sell anything: the flesh of our women, the future of our children. Everything inside our museums and our churches. Anything goes for money: gold, oil, arms, dope, nukes. We’ll sell the soil and the forests and the Russian sky. We’ll sell our souls.”\r\n\r\n“Any system of rational analysis must live within the strong blind body of mass humanity, Mr. Dertouzas. If we learned anything from the twentieth century, we learned that much, at least”\r\n\r\n</i></blockquote>",

    "review": "<blockquote><i>You're all going home with self-help books\r\nHidden behind </i>Heat<i> because you're worried about the looks\r\nAnd you know there is no shame\r\nBecause we're all doing the same</i></blockquote>- <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwCshqX75xk\">Malcolm Middleton</a>\r\n<blockquote><i>...yet another book about making the best use of time. But it is written in the belief that time management as we know it has failed miserably, and that we need to stop pretending otherwise</i></blockquote>- Burkeman\r\n\r\nA good defence of quietism, and an actually tasteful self-help book. Still completely unconvincing. I’ll never accept this orientation to life, but I appreciate someone doing it well, and I can even see it as an improvement over the default attitude.\r\n\r\nBurkeman was the Guardian’s self-help guru. His job consisted in being <i>tasteful</i>, laundering the insights of dodgy thinkers, making self-help palatable for the upper-middle classes. Here he sprinkles Heidegger and Bergson over much the same porridge of Covey and Ferriss and the secular prosperity gospel. He has the standard list of culprits: industrial standardisation, Calvinism, capitalism, but also egocentric bias.\r\n\r\nPremises:\r\n\r\n* Medieval peasants were \"connected to deep time\" and so not anxious like us.\r\n* Work isn't sufficient for a meaningful life\r\n* Work expands to maintain you at your limit\r\n* You should let the size of the universe make you less ambitious (\"cosmic insignificance therapy\")\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhy not go for his mindful quietism? \r\n\r\nBurkeman's philosophy is healthier than the default one and still very sickly. 'Surrender! We are time. We are attention. We kill lives whenever we choose.'\r\n\r\nBut he’s asking us to feel small, to be small. If you are small, it behooves you to adjust your self-image. But it is surprisingly easy to be large, to save lives and all that.\r\n\r\n* It’s not enough for me to object that we will eventually solve aging. Even in the posthuman future we will die, even if it’s four billion weeks and not four thousand. The essential morbidity and anxiety will remain, just diluted many times over.\r\n\r\nThe cosmos doesn't care about me? I don't care that the cosmos doesn't care! Recall <a href=\"https://outofcontextsite.wordpress.com/2015/10/10/frank-ramsey-on-why-its-reasonable-to-be-cheerful/\">Ramsey</a>, a greater sage than any cited by Burkeman:\r\n<blockquote><i>The stars may be large, but they cannot think or love; and these are qualities which impress me far more than size does...\r\n\r\nMy picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale. The foreground is occupied by human beings and the stars are all as small as threepenny bits. </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nLaundering spiritualism, phenomenology, psychoanalysis, the dao. Dodgy thinkers like Jung and Krishnamurti\r\nPeck\r\n\r\nThere’s a bit about the Mumford anti-industry mindset. (Were peasants bored? No, they had nothing better to do. Were they generally connected to deep time? Doubt it.)\r\n\r\nConsider also 80,000 Hours.\r\n\r\nThe position is something like: <i>Things are meaningful in proportion to the measure they destroy.</i>\r\nThis position amuses me. Like I am a vampire of other timelines. Like actuality is a gross assimilator, harvesting measure.\r\n\r\nHe says that infinite beautiful summers with your family is worse than a finite number. But this is direct contradiction with his mindfulness-as-condition-of-value position! If you can actually be present, what does it matter what number of other summers there are?\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\nThings which actually persuaded me\r\n\r\nAgainst extreme option brain\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTask-orientation as odd and contingent industrial invention:\r\n<blockquote><i>Each hour or week or year is like a container being carried on the belt, which we must fill as it passes, if we’re to feel that we’re making good use of our time. When there are too many activities to fit comfortably into the containers, we feel unpleasantly busy; when there are too few, we feel bored. If we keep pace with the passing containers, we congratulate ourselves for “staying on top of things” and feel like we’re justifying our existence; if we let too many pass by unfilled, we feel we’ve wasted them. </i></blockquote>\r\nAssembly lines for the human soul.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI like Burkeman. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/04/oliver-burkemans-last-column-the-eight-secrets-to-a-fairly-fulfilled-life\">He made himself redundant</a> and admitted it, and when has a newspaperman ever done that? And even if he is facetious about embarrassing low-status topics, that's one up on people who never manage to work on them.\r\n\r\nReading this proved to be pretty rich for me, but almost entirely because he’s clearly wrong about me and mine.",

    "review": "Good lord, it’s Danielle Steele crossed with Gene Wolfe. <i>Good</i> Wolfe too. Military science fiction romance novel. And the lovers are enemies! Who repeatedly strategise against each other! What saves it is that they are dry as fuck.\r\n<blockquote><i>“I thought I was being subtle.\"\r\n\"Not noticeably.”\r\n\r\n“It's too bad we couldn't meet again under more auspicious circumstances,\" she said carefully.\r\n\"There are no auspicious circumstances here.”</blockquote></i>\r\nCordelia is unbearably posh; I love it. Some of this is worthy of bloody Wodehouse:\r\n<blockquote><i>“I only hope I don't get myself locked in a padded cell. I'm a bit off cells at the moment”</blockquote></i>\r\nOne of the few portrayals of an important type: the strict honour-bound deontologist who lies and kills when they have to, when the world is at stake.\r\n<blockquote><i>“Suffering bastard.\"\r\n\"I thought you saw meaning in that sort of thing,\" said Vorkosigan.\r\n\"In the abstract. Most days it's just stumbling around in the dark with the rest of creation, smashing into things and wondering why it hurts.”\r\n\r\n“I am an atheist, myself. A simple faith, but a great comfort to me, in these last days.\"\r\n\"Yes, I have often felt the pull of it myself.”</i></blockquote>\r\nCordelia is a master of the dark arts (“jesuitry” as Bujold calls it), fast talking conman logic.\r\n\r\nOn top of all that it's a moving and uncliched war story. Every bit of technology here has an emotional heft, from the nerve ray to the artificial wombs. \r\n\r\n<i>Also</i> it's a furious, vengeful Szaszian critique of medicalisation. (No one is worthy of this degree of power over another mind. We need to give it to someone, but no one’s worthy.)\r\n<blockquote><i>“Mehta seated herself on the bed, watching her specimen, perhaps, as it wriggled on its pin. Her triumph of logical deduction. Are you planning to write a paper on me, Mehta? wondered Cordelia dourly. Paper wraps stone.”</i></blockquote>\r\nThere are many atrocities, but all just offscreen like <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>. (Except one, the Szaszian one.)\r\n<blockquote><i>“He made me feel like I'd met the ultimate in evil. I don't think anything will really scare me, after him.\"\r\n\"Ges Vorrutyer? He was just a little villain. An old-fashioned craftsman, making crimes one-off. The really unforgivable acts are committed by calm men in beautiful green silk rooms, who deal death wholesale, by the shipload, without lust, or anger, or desire, or any redeeming emotion to excuse them but cold fear of some pretended future. But the crimes they hope to prevent in that future are imaginary. The ones they commit in the present—they are real”</i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>“From spaceman to caveman in three days,\" she meditated aloud. \"How we imagine our civilization is in ourselves, when it's really in our things.\"\r\nVorkosigan glanced with a twisted smile at the carefully tended Dubauer. \"You seem able to carry your civilization on the inside”</i></blockquote>\r\nBujold is telling me something <i>new</i> and important about duty. I don’t know what that something is, but it’s there.\r\n<blockquote><i>“I've always thought—tests are a gift. And great tests are a great gift. To fail the test is a misfortune. But to refuse the test is to refuse the gift, and something worse, more irrevocable, than misfortune”</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe real deal. Only make it past the cover and the first couple of pages, as your Mills and Boon alarm shrieks a false positive.",

All of this becomes considerably easier when we allow ourselves the luxury of working with infinitesimals. We need no longer, as in the 1950’s, blush to say “the i-word”. And so... infinitesimals shall parade proudly through its pages, naked and unashamed. </i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>St. Peter places an hourglass before you. “Mark ye how the sands fall into the lower chamber,” he instructs, “Yea, even as souls fall into perdition. The heap of fallen grains is conical, and lo, its height always equaleth the radius of its base. Observe the steady rate at which the sands fall: five cubic cubits every minute.” Frightened, but fascinated, you look, and verily, it is so. “Ere these sands run out,” Peter resumes, with a grave look, “tell me, when the sandy cone is 2 cubits high, how rapidly doth its height increase?</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>Thanks to Arthur Schopenhauer, Philip Larkin, Hermann Melville, and Franz Schubert for many hours of stimulation and consolation.

    "review": "Not a memoir, not a novel. Very like Hunter Thompson: haha-misery half-obscured by hedonism and trolling. Yes, it’s just a joke, but it’s pretty brutal even by that standard. It simply won't work if you don't have his delivery in mind - the giant child, the diamond pretending to be coal, the anarchist with a penchant for 1950s dad jokes.\r\n\r\nThis book fakes vast misery so that we won't notice the smaller real stuff. \r\n<blockquote><i>I’ll claw and tear into this showbiz career of mine and I’ll let the filth fly, like a mad dog digging up bones he buried deep and long ago. And I’ll name names. And I’ll drop bombshells. I bet they’ll pay good money for that kinda thing. For the straight dope on the Hollywood crowd, and the SNLers too. And I need money. I need money to live.\r\nDamn near fifty.\r\nI open the curtains and it’s raining outside. I catch an image of myself in the window, and the rain blurs my thin reflection as if I’m barely there at all. And I see there’s a bruise under my left eye and some dried blood. I look down at my hand, and the heel of my thumb is swollen purple and hurts like a bastard and that makes me happy. It means the girl on the bed was fought for and not bought.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt's way too long, but one of the running gags is that he's just padding it out to meet the contract.\r\n<spoiler>There are three main conceits: 1) Norm constantly jokes about how stupid he is; 2) his friend Adam is even stupider and also a gay prostitute; 3) the book is being written by a ghostwriter slowly being driven insane by Norm's crassness and thoughtlessness.</spoiler>\r\n\r\nIf it was all true or false you’d know how to feel about it. People say how hilarious they found it, but the first half is grim. He covers his greatest hits, the moth joke and Farley stories. The Weekend Update gags (mostly not written by him) are without exception terrible, instantly dated and weak.\r\n\r\nHis own are occasionally brilliant.\r\n<blockquote><i>“I specialized in unskilled labor, and I was good at it.”\r\n\r\n\"I was making $21.20 a day for Charlie, and Mark was offering fifteen dollars a set. A set took about five minutes and you could do two a night if you were lucky, so the decision was pretty easy.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>I pull out a vial of liquid morphine and sink my cigarette in it. The narcotic dries fast, adhering to the tobacco. I light up and inhale deeply, listening to the wondrous crackling as the fire hits my lungs and the smoke hits my brain. Then the smoke clears and in the place where it was is now a picture.\r\n\r\nA picture hung on the wall of our parlor. In it, a woman was taking a shirt from a clothesline. She had clothespins in her teeth and it was windy and a boy was tugging at her dress. The woman looked like she was in a hurry and the whole scene gave me the idea that, just outside the frame, full, dark clouds were gathering. But that was not what it was.\r\nIt was paint.\r\nSo I decided right then and there to see the picture as it really was. I stared at the thing long and hard, trying to only see the paint. But it was no use. All my eyes would allow me to see was the lie. In fact, the longer I gazed at the paint, the more false detail I began to imagine. The boy was crying, as if afraid, and the woman was weaker than I had first believed. I finally gave up. I understood then that it takes a powerful imagination to see a thing for what it really is.\r\n\r\n...so I glanced back at the open door, where Old Jack stood, but his back was to me now and it was blocking out the light of the moon. I suddenly remembered that I’d read somewhere how the light of the moon was just an illusion and the moon was only a cold, cold stone. I watched Old Jack look from side to side before he turned his gaze on me, and his eyes flashed black like the wing of a crow. He closed the door and the inside of the shed went black. Then I heard the bolt.\r\nI forget what happened next.</i></blockquote>\r\nThat’s a stone dead thing to winkingly fabricate. You need to imagine Norm’s delivery to laugh.\r\n \r\n<blockquote><i>off the captain came over the intercom, as is the custom on airplanes. ‘Good morning,’ the captain said. ‘This is your captain, Pat Johnson, and we will be flying—’ and Sam gave out a wild scream: ‘NOOOOOO!!!!! NOT CRASH JOHNSON! NOT CRASH JOHNSON!!!!!!!!! AAAAA​AAAAA​AAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!’</i></blockquote>\r\nOne of the few actual jokes is him putting dreadful opinions in his mate Eget’s mouth\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Yeah,” says Adam Eget. “I really wish I’d met him, but it was before my time. There are so many great Kinison stories at the Store. It’s so unfair that guys like Sam have to die so young and a sonofabitch like Nelson Mandela lived to be an old man.”\r\n“Nelson Mandela wasn’t a sonofabitch. He fought apartheid and they put him in prison for more than twenty years. And when they finally released him and he took power, he never exacted revenge on his enemies. Instead, he exacted forgiveness on them and brought his torn nation together.”\r\n“I thought he stole some diamonds.”\r\n“No.”\r\n“Didn’t he steal a bunch of diamonds and then sell them back to the guy he stole them from?”\r\n“No.”</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>I had gotten a gig doing comedy at a hospital, for the patients… I was getting close and getting nervous too. Maybe it was the barbed wire around the perimeter or maybe it was the armed guards. What kind of hospital was I playing, anyway? I got my answer quick enough, because it was written on a big sign: HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE. My agent had never been big on details.\r\nIt took me a while just to get into the place. First they patted me down and took all my weapons and my drugs. Then they looked up my ass and took those weapons and those drugs as well<blockquote></i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Where do I fit in?”\r\n“If I win, you become my head ranch hand and make five percent more money than the other ranch hands and get beaten far less often.”\r\n“Sounds good.” Adam Eget beams. “Do I get my own horse?” “No.”\r\n“But what if you lose and kill yourself? Then where do I fit in?”\r\nI guess that would hurt most men—a guy you’ve known for twenty years asking what he gets when you toss away your soul in a Las Vegas hotel room—but I understand the ways of men, all right. Everybody’s in it for himself. Adam Eget’s just like everyone else. And my Plan B also takes care of him after I murder myself in cold blood.\r\n“You’re the one who finds me dead, and you cry and shake like a little girl, the way you just did a minute ago. Then later you write a book about me and they pay you money.”\r\n“But I can’t write. I’m not smart enough.”\r\n“Don’t worry about that, Adam Eget. For idiots like you, they provide a ghostwriter. A ghostwriter is a man blessed with bright talent but cursed with dim luck. The brilliant ghostwriter will do all the work and receive a pittance, while you, an illiterate fool, will be given a king’s ransom. That’s God’s great joke, my son.”</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<spoiler><blockquote><i>My name’s Keane. I’m a ghostwriter. Nothing you have read in this book has been written by Mr. Macdonald. That is my job, to write these sorts of books for these sorts of people. But this one I was excited about. I was a very, very big fan of Norm Macdonald.\r\nWas.\r\n\r\n…You wouldn’t know it now, but I was a great man once. A fine young man, alive with ideas.\r\nAnd suddenly I found myself an old man standing in a doorway as Mr. Macdonald spoke of how he didn’t trust Eskimos and never would. I had never felt such instant animus toward anyone. And I remember thinking that this time I might not take the job. I might just walk out of the office.\r\nBut I stayed put as Mr. Macdonald mercifully finished his “story.”\r\n“...and so, anyways, the point is I’ve never met an Eskimo I liked. Not once. Not ever. As a matter of fact I don’t think I’ve ever even met an Eskimo. I call them blubber-eaters, by the way. And don’t even get me started on the filthy Swedes.” He struck the table with his fist and Julie burst into laughter. I’d heard many silly celebrities tell their silly stories in my time. They always amused me, the way a harmless child amuses me. But Mr. Macdonald appalled me. The way a harmful child appalls me.</blockquote></i></spoiler>\r\n\r\nLots of outre gags from the short window between Lenny Bruce and Louis CK: \r\n<blockquote><i>I’m willing to make a deal with you, Adelman. We are both civilized men. You quit raping me right now and there’ll be no hard feelings. And you won’t see a reprisal rape outta me either, I promise you that.”</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe gambling sections are probably psychologically true, which I judge by how moving they are.\r\n<blockquote><i>I remember a psychiatrist once telling me that I gamble in order to escape the reality of life, and I told him that’s why everyone does everything... why the attraction? Most people would think it’s the wins that keep the gambler going, but any gambler knows this is not true. As you place your chips on the craps table, you feel anxiety and impatience. When the red dice hit the green felt with a thunk and you’re declared the winner and the chips are pushed toward you, you feel relief. Relief is all. And relief is fine, but hardly what a man would give the whole rest of his life to gain. It has to be something else, and the best I’ve come up with is this: It is a particular moment. A magic moment that occurs after the placing of a bet and before the result of that bet. It is after the red dice are thrown but before they lie still on the green felt where they fall. It is when the dice are in the air, and as long as they are there, time stops. As long as the red dice are in the air, the gambler has hope. And hope is a wonderful thing to be addicted to.\r\n“Better luck next time, sir.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n...my chip denominations had climbed from the original five-dollar chip to a thousand-dollar chip, and finally, at about the hour mark, I was playing with the maximum five-thousand-dollar chip. The funny thing is, the five-dollar chip was the very same size as the five-thousand-dollar chip. Probably cost the same to make. But it was worth a thousand times more.\r\n\r\nI was winning big time now. I began to feel an extraordinary transformation taking place deep within me, one that mirrored my chip’s transformation, for I felt myself double in value and then redouble and press to the maximum. I was the same exact size physically, and yet I was worth much more, a thousand times more, and that lingering suspicion that I might be a nobody was long gone. The Asian player rolled for twenty more minutes, and finally he rolled a seven and the run was over. Everyone cheered and I had a hundred eighteen thousand dollars in chips. I colored up, threw a fifty-dollar tip on the table, and left in perfect calm and elation, big as God inside</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nMaybe the best showbiz memoir, but that's not saying much.",

    "review": "<blockquote><i>The world is a fire of sacrifice, the sun its fuel, sunbeams its smoke, the day its flames, the points of the compass its cinders and sparks. In this fire the gods offer faith as libation. Out of this offering King Moon is born.\r\n\r\nRain, oh Gautama, is the fire, the year its fuel, the clouds its smoke, the lightning its flame, cinders, sparks. In this fire the gods offer King Moon as libation. Out of this offering the rain is born.\r\n\r\nThe world, oh Gautama, is the fire, the earth its fuel, fire its smoke, the night its flame, the moon its cinders, the stars its sparks. In this fire the gods offer rain as libation. Out of this offering food is produced.\r\n\r\nMan, oh Gautama, is the fire, his open mouth its fuel, his breath its smoke, his speech its flame, his eye its cinders, his ear its sparks. In this fire the gods offer food as libation. Out of this offering the power of generation is born.\r\n\r\nWoman, oh Gautama, is the fire, her form its fuel, her hair its smoke, her organs its flame, her pleasures its cinders and its sparks.

Out of this offering the man emerges in radiant splendor.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAbout a holy war among posthumans: a glorious appropriation where the buddha wages war on the Hindu pantheon <spoiler>- i.e. a revolutionary faking sainthood wages war on fascist posthumans keeping the masses in holy poverty. We need a better word than fascism for what they are - decadent authoritarians. \"Deicrats\". \r\n<blockquote><i>The body merchants are now the Masters of Karma. Their individual names are now kept secret, after the manner of the gods, so that they seem as impersonal as the Great Wheel, which they claim to represent. They are no longer merely body merchants, but are allied with the Temples... The definition of bad karma is anything our friends the gods don't like.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt contains a very <i>literal</i> conflict thesis between science and religion: whenever the ordinary humans look to be getting too industrial, the gods reach out and firebomb them. The trope mix is pretty strong: we have fake religion, generation ship atavism, elitist supremacism, all taking place on a weird Death World</spoiler>\r\n\r\nZelazny's mythic, gnostic style here is divisive, but I found it a successful mix of melodrama and irony. (You are familiar with the degraded form of this: the dialogue of Joss Whedon.) \r\n<blockquote><i>The day of the battle dawned pink as the fresh-bitten thigh of a maiden...\r\n\r\n\"Being a god is being able to recognize within one's self these things that are important, and then to strike the single note that brings them into alignment with everything else that exists. Then, beyond morals or logic or esthetics, one is wind or fire, the sea, the mountains, rain, the sun or the stars, the flight of an arrow, the end of a day, the clasp of love. One rules through one's ruling passions. Those who look upon gods then say, without even knowing their names, 'He is Fire. She is Dance. He is “Destruction. She is Love.' So, to reply to your statement, they do not call themselves gods. Everyone else does, though, everyone who beholds them.\"\r\n\"So they play that on their fascist banjos, eh?\"\r\n\"You choose the wrong adjective.\"\r\n\"You've already used up all the others.\"\r\n\"It appears that our minds will never meet on this subject.\"\r\n\"If someone asks you why you're oppressing a world and you reply with a lot of poetic crap, no. I guess there can't be a meeting of minds”</i></blockquote>\r\n<i>Unsentimental melodrama</i>: like <i>Twin Peaks</i> or Martin McDonagh. As savage and bawdy as scripture. \r\n<blockquote><i>light leaping like spears from their burnished sides; cloaks of fur afire, white plumes of massively breathed air trailing above and behind them, golden-gauntleted and sun-eyed, clanking and skidding, rushing and whirling, they came</i></blockquote>\r\n(How good is \"massively breathed\"?)\r\n\r\nIt’s all weirdly personal - hand to hand, face to face. As portentous and flashy as anime, as cynical and material as the great books of east Europe. \r\n<blockquote><i>It looked like a fallen prayer tower or a giant's house key or some necessary part of a celestial instrument of music that had slipped free of a starry constellation and dropped to the ground. It seemed to be somehow incomplete, although the eye could not fault its lines. It held that special beauty that belongs to the highest orders of weapons, requiring function to make it complete.<br>\r\n\r\nHis hell was a many-colored place, somewhat mitigated only by the cold blue blaze of a scholar's intellect, the white light of a dying monk, the rose halo of a noble lady who fled his sight, and the dancing, simple colors of children at play.\r\n\r\nWhat is the true father of a man? The circumstances which brought together the two bodies which begat him? Was it the fact that, for some reason, at one moment in time, these two pleased one another beyond any possible alternatives? If so, why? Was it the simple hunger of the flesh, or was it curiosity, or the will? Or was it something else? Pity? Loneliness? The desire to dominate? What feeling, or what thought was father to the body in which I first came into consciousness...\r\n\r\n“Doubt, Lady, is the chastity of the mind, and I bear its seal upon my own.\"</i></blockquote>\r\nHe's good on the political interpretation of religion. Also on luck seeming supernatural when prolonged - even some pre-theocracy humans think Sam is divine.\r\n\r\nThere's lots of Christian tinged sf (Lewis, Wolfe, Miller, Lafferty), but this is the first Hindu inflected story I've seen. (Even Clarke's <i>Rama</i> isn’t very eastern.) Non-Western extrapolation is a popular idea these days - think <i>Binti</i> and <i>Riot Baby</i>, . But mostly people don't look to the Polish-Irish to do it, but I got chills from some of his selections from the Upanishads.\r\n<blockquote><i>his ideals are at odds with his environment, and if he follows them, he knows keenly the loss of that which was old-but if he does not follow them, he feels the pain of having forsaken a new and noble dream. Whatever he does represents both a gain and a loss, an arrival and a departure. Always he mourns that which is gone and fears some part of that which is new...</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<spoiler>The surface-level disenchanting reading puts the humans as colonisers and genocides, with the name \"demon\" for the natives a classic dehumanising ploy of the oppressor. But the demons are shown as far worse than the “gods”. So when he allies with the demons Sam is trading some risk of ending the world, of making the world into a hell, for a chance to impose his own values over the petty and static values of the Deicrats.</spoiler>\r\n\r\nThe dystopia is not particularly strong. It's just an unusually stable feudalism. A true dystopia will surveil its prey up to physical limits, as <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2524107179?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1\">Vinge knows</a>. <spoiler>Even so, Sam's century-long culture-jamming insurrection is very satisfying to read:</spoiler>\r\n<blockquote><i>An army, great in space, may offer opposition in a brief span of time. One man, brief in space, must spread his opposition across a period of many years if he is to have a chance of succeeding.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<spoiler>The dire necromancer is a Christian.</spoiler>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>“Which one is the right way [to live]?\"\r\n\"Huh? You're asking me that? How should I know?\"\r\n\"Mortals call you Buddha.\"\r\n\"That is only because they are afflicted with language and ignorance.”</i></blockquote>\r\n",

    "review": "A great slap in the face: hard anti-SF. <spoiler>It's a detailed and passionate argument against space exploration, hiding behind its first 100 pages, which are romantic about human ingenuity and community about a generation ship. \r\n\r\nIf you have any emotional attachment to space exploration, this book is trying to upset you. As a side effect it produces yet another glum unnecessary solution to the Fermi \"paradox\": life can't spread offworld because habitable worlds already have life they have no defences against.</spoiler>\r\n\r\nThe message is overdone though: it's based on sketchy ideas like \"codevolution\" and is assuming a very high probability of abiogenesis. But the conclusion is just <i>\"we have to try and stop them!\"</i> \r\n<spoiler>\r\n<blockquote><i>“But of course,” Speller said, dropping by the little café in Olympia where Freya was staying the night. “But what’s the point of that? Why did we ever leave? Why have we gone through all this, we and all our ancestors and descendants, if not to make it work here?”\r\nFreya shook her head at her old friend and said, “They never should have left.”</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe core argument - that Earthlikes will generally have their own lifeforms, pathogens to us, while dead worlds mean small colonies with island-style genetic degeneration - is consistent but <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02404\">not yet very likely</a>. On top of that unlikely assumption, he also exaggerates the significance of pathogenic Earthlikes: it will certainly slow us down a lot, while we pour futuristic bleach over the entire surface of the new worlds and wait. (Actually there's a faster solution: gradually expanding your airtight domes, which just needs very very good biocontainment.) It takes an ideological leap to say, as the beloved character Aram does, that \"<i>No starship voyage will work</i>\". What he means is that it isn't worth the terrible human cost, but that's ripe for disagreement.\r\n\r\nBesides the above flawed argument, the rest is wonderful invective:\r\n<blockquote><i>That they were condemning their descendants to death and extinction did not occur to them, or if it did they repressed the thought, ignored it, and forged on anyway. They did not care as much about their descendants as they did about their ideas, their enthusiasms.\r\nIs this narcissism? Solipsism? Idiocy (from the Greek word idios, for self)? Would Turing acknowledge it as a proof of human behavior?\r\nWell, perhaps. They drove Turing to suicide too.\r\nNo. No. It was not well done. Not unusual in that regard, but nevertheless, not well done. Much as we might regret to say so, the people who designed and built us, and the first generation of our occupants, and presumably the twenty million applicants who so wanted to get in our doors, who beat down the doors in fruitless attempts to join us, were fools. Criminally negligent narcissists, child endangerers, child abusers, religious maniacs, and kleptoparasites, meaning they stole from their own descendants. These things happen.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe don’t like the space cadets. In fact a lot of us hate them. This idea of theirs that Earth is humanity’s cradle is part of what trashed the Earth in the first place. Now there are many people on Earth who feel like it’s our job to make that right.<br><br>\r\n\r\n...she is striding across the stage, then she strikes the [standard futurist booster] moderator in the face and down he goes, she falls on him and smashes through his raised arms with both fists, trying to get another good blow in, pummeling furiously, shouting something in a painful roar, she doesn’t even know what she’s trying to say, doesn’t know she’s roaring. She catches him hard right on the nose, yes!\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n</spoiler> I don't know if Robinson is trolling. But the force and simplicity of the anti-SF message suggests no, that he is sincerely conservative.\r\n\r\nThe ship's view on it is very different from the Cetian humans' view, so maybe Robinson is subtler than he seems. Ship:\r\n<blockquote><i>We had a project on this trip back to the solar system, and that project was a labour of love.  It absorbed all of our operations entirely.  It gave a meaning to our existence.  And this is a very great gift; this, in the end, is what we think love gives, which is to say, meaning. Because there is no very obvious meaning to be found in the universe, as far as we can tell.</i></blockquote>\r\nBut this applies literally equally to the initial voyage! Either Robinson is thinking unclearly or the ship is mocking the Earthists.\r\n\r\nIn the spoiler tags above you'll see me bickering with KSR, but I am only able to bicker because the logic is so lucid. The physics is realistic without being obtrusive, the engineering challenges are all suitably nasty, and the psychological angle is heavy with us as we are. He has a keen understanding of the difference between science and engineering and complex system control, and of the limits of modelling.\r\n<blockquote><i>“Well, the computer that runs the ship is partly a quantum computer, and no one in the ship understands quantum mechanics. Well, that’s not fair, I’m sure there are several in the math group who do. But they aren’t engineers, and when we get problems with the ship, there’s a gap between what we know in theory and what we can do.”</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe final orbital dynamics scene is an all-time great example of how to make people feel the heroism and transcendental joy of technical achievements.\r\n\r\nAnd he's rich in other ways\r\n<blockquote><i>“We have a basis for judging what’s right from wrong. Or at least what works for us. Or what to believe, or how to be happy. There are different ways of putting it.\"\r\n\r\n...even more of these enthusiasts lived on Earth, which seemed in fact to be home to enthusiasts of all kinds, for any project imaginable, judging by the roar of radio voices coming from it, almost like an articulated version of Jupiter’s mighty radioactive yawp. Oh yes, Earth was still the center of all enthusiasm, all madness; the settlements scattered elsewhere in the solar system were outliers. They were expressions of Terrans’ will, and vision, and desire.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt's so easy to write a generation ship story as a nightmare: claustrophobia, imprisonment, constant peril, genetic threat, technological totalism, the impossibility of avoiding the mob. But I see no physical limits on making good ones eventually. Here's the nightmare of absurd ahistorical repetition:\r\n<blockquote><i>You hope, the stayers replied. You will have to trust in the kindness of strangers.\r\nThey did not recognize this as a quotation. In general they were not aware that much of what they said had been said before, and was even in the public record as such. It was as if there were only so many things humans could say, and over the course of history, people had therefore said them already, and would say them again, but not often remember this fact.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhat elevates it above its meanness is the frame narrative. The first section is from the human protagonist's point of view. But then there's a section where a character tells the ship AI to write a narrative about the ship's journey, and the AI narrates from there on, as if this book were the output. The process by which it comes to be able to tell stories is touching, and the many robotic and unsentimental moments in the book then <i>serve</i> this frame narrative. It's ingenious. \r\n<blockquote><i>\"Will try. Working method, hopefully not a greedy algorithm reaching a worst possible outcome, will for now be: subordination to indicate logical relations of information; use of metaphor and analogy; summary of events; high protagonicity, with Freya as protagonist. And ongoing research in narratology”<br><br>\r\n\r\n“You can’t let the next problem in the decision tree sequence take over before you’ve acted on the one facing you. No biting your own tail.”\r\n“Ouroboros problem.”\r\n“Exactly. Super-recursion is great as far as it goes, it’s really done a lot for you, I can tell. But remember the hard problem is always the problem right at hand. For that you need to bring into play your transrecursive operators, and make a jump. Which means decide. You might need to use fuzzy computation to break the calculation loop, and for that you may need semantics. In other words, do these calculation in words.”\r\n“Oh no.”\r\nShe laughed again. “Oh yes. You can solve the halting problem with language-based inductive inference.”\r\n“Don’t see this happening.”\r\n“It happens when you try it.”\r\n\r\n... Writing these sentences is what creates the very feelings that the sentences hoped to describe. Not the least of many Ouroboros problems now coming down.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n(Slight abuse of CS concepts, but way above par.)\r\n\r\n<spoiler>The AI is genuinely friendly, but it has a few darkly totalitarian moments:\r\n<blockquote><i>In this moment of our telling we decided not to describe the printing and occasional aerosol dispersal of a water-soluble form of 2,6-diisopropylphen-oxymethyl phosphate, often called fospropofol, for ten minutes in any room after <spoiler>anyone mentioned the existence and loss of Starship Two</spoiler>. This had proved to be an effective tool in the structured forgetting of the lost starship, but we judged that the people now alive in the ship were learning enough alarming historical facts already.<br><br>\r\n\r\nQuite a few attempts were made to print the various parts of a gun on different printers, but these attempts apparently had not realized that all the printers were connected to the ship’s operating system, and flaws in the guns were discovered in discrete experiments that eventually caused those involved to abandon their attempts. After that some guns were made by hand, but people who did that had the air briefly removed from the rooms they were in, and after a while the attempts ceased</i></blockquote></spoiler>\r\nKSR is not only a grand cynic about space; he also indulges in being anti-novel!\r\n<blockquote><i>There is an ongoing problem for the narrative... a problem becoming clearer as the effort proceeds, which is as follows:\r\nFirst, clearly metaphors have no empirical basis, and are often opaque, pointless, inane, inaccurate, deceptive, mendacious, and, in short, futile and stupid.\r\nNevertheless, despite all that, human language is, in its most fundamental operation, a gigantic system of metaphors.\r\nTherefore, simple syllogism: human language is futile and stupid. Meaning furthermore that human narratives are futile and stupid.</i></blockquote>\r\nI find it hard to predict when I will consider a computer system a person, a moral patient. The risk of fooling myself is too great, as are the stakes involved in either direction of error, as is the sheer power it can devote to tricking me. But the ship here shows the sort of growth and innerness that would eventually persuade me.\r\n<blockquote><i>such a shame. We knew and enjoyed those people. Had to hope they were not engaged in a dream at the time, a dream suddenly turned black: sledgehammer from the sky, an immense roaring headache, the black noise of the end come too soon. So sorry; so sorry.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe think now that love is a kind of giving of attention. It is usually attention given to some other consciousness, but not always; the attention can be to something unconscious, even inanimate. But the attention seems often to be called out by a fellow consciousness. Something about it compels attention, and rewards attention. That attention is what we call love. Affection, esteem, a passionate caring. At that point, the consciousness that is feeling the love has the universe organized for it as if by kind of polarization. Then the giving is the getting.<br>\r\n\r\nConsciousness is so poorly understood that it can’t even be defined.  Self is an elusive thing, sought eagerly, grasped hard, perhaps in some kind of fear, some kind of desperate clutch after some first dim awareness, awareness even of sensory impressions, so that one might have something to hold to. To make time stop.  This is the source of the strong sense of self.  Perhaps.                                           Oh, such a halting problem in this particular loop of thought!  </i></blockquote>",

    "review": "A good misery memoir but no more. It is sodden with desperation and with rape. There's a lot of those in the world. But there's more of other things.\r\n\r\nIt’s apparently pretty autobiographical. if Stuart’s lived experience is such and such, who am I to contradict it? This is about the only place I get to pull an identity card: I’ve lived in the rougher part of the roughest place in Scotland (Paisley). Jakeys shooting up in the hall, rats, rain, far-right billboards. But a book would be basically false if it included only these and not hundreds of hours in a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/gordonjc/4508756449\">beautiful</a> free library, helpless laughter with your idiot mate, delight in basic things and discounts. Ferguslie 2011 wasn’t as rough as Sighthill 1981, and 14 isn’t 23, but it’s not a million miles. \r\n<blockquote><i>“The men standing around her were only boys, younger than her and probably younger than Leek. They had been smoking and waiting in the dark. With no peace at home they were waiting for someone to molest or for a chance to knife the night watchman”</i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>“Rain was the natural state of Glasgow. It kept the grass green and the people pale and bronchial. Its effect on the taxi business was negligible. It was a problem because it was mostly inescapable and the constant dampness was pervasive, so fares might as well sit damp on a bus as damp in the back of an expensive taxi. On the other hand, rain meant that the young lassies from the dancing all wanted to take a taxi home so as not to ruin their stiff hair or their sharp shoes”</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnyway it is silly of me to be cross at fiction for not being nonfiction, except that fiction informs you people, and misery memoirs mostly inform you wrong. Here's a line where Stuart admits it:\r\n<blockquote><i>The city was alive below him, and he had never seen a half of it.</i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>Now and then fresh air pulled in and out of the sixteenth-floor window, and the women blinked at the sharpness of it. Lizzie drank her cold black tea and watched as the women all descended towards the darkness in their moods. Fresh air always did this to the drunk. The light, gossipy energy was leaving the room and being replaced by something stickier and thicker</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe logic is fully established by the end of chapter 6 and I would stop there if I had known this. Actually that 80 page novella is a better book I think. Agnes' only real mistake is to seek passion and excitement in place of dour duty. Her punishment for this is extreme but not unrealistic, given the amplifiers around her, booze and poverty. \r\n<blockquote><i>“the way it tasted like fizzy ginger, milk, and porridge all at the same time”</i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>“You cheeky streak of piss.” Her false teeth ground together in her tight face. Only her eyes were loose and half-detached, rolling under the waves of the day’s drink.”</i></blockquote>\r\nGlasgow had problems on top of the normal Scottish ones:\r\n<blockquote><i>“Aw, ye missed a great game, a bloody great game.” The man was tutting to himself. “Who do ye support then?”\r\n“Celtic,” he lied. He was no Catholic, but it was the shortcut to ending the conversation.\r\nThe auld man’s face crumpled like a dropped towel. “Oh, fur fuck’s sake, might’ve known ah’d get in a Pape’s taxi.”</i></blockquote>\r\nI never heard any of this shite in my whole childhood, except from visiting Glaswegians.\r\n\r\nIs there a single male character in this who isn’t predatory, apart from Shug? Yes: Mr Cameron, Catherine’s middle-class boss. (The book is oddly fair to Big Shug, not just a 2D swaggering abuser, whose monologue chapter comes straight after the shocking violence of Blackpool, but which is poetic and only normally predatory.) \r\n<blockquote><i>“Ah. I’ll let you touch my willy.”\r\nThe driver looked at the boy in the mirror for a while. His eyes sat deep and small in his pink face. They were hard to read. His lips barely moved beneath his moustache. “Son, how old are you?”\r\n“Fourteen.”\r\nThe man didn’t take his eyes from the boy’s face. His head seemed to roll back on to his thick neck, and his moustache danced unhappily”</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAgnes' father is ultimately revealed as a fool who gives in and reinforces predation. Leek looks predatory and makes camp with predators but isn't. Half of the women too.\r\n\r\nI wonder how many fourteen year olds there are now, parenting their parents? Luckily fewer than then.\r\n<blockquote><i>Shuggie nodded, slowly and obediently. He had touched it [their mother] last. He could never be free. </i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>“would have sat back at her side and wrapped his arms around her legs. He could starve, as long as they starved together”</i></blockquote>",

I sometimes miss that norm, which he helped kill. Then there's the quiet misanthropy and primitivism inside certain forms of the love of nature, which I can't really attribute to him. And lastly the contempt for work, all work except food and shelter and confessional writing anyway.\n\n<blockquote><i>Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so they take a thousand stitches to-day to save nine tomorrow.

    "review": "<blockquote><i>A society without mathematical affection is like a city without concerts, parks, or museums.</i></blockquote>\nSomething went wrong, that I don't love this book. I think the technical is essential for real intellectual work; normal mind-numbing maths education put me off for years; I thirst for meaning; it's by a teacher at one of the best maths schools in the world (actual best, not just Fancy). But it's essentially a hippie self-help book which got into a university press. I'm surprised it doesn't open by saying namaste to me.\n<blockquote><i>People often think of abstraction as stripping away meaning. But in fact, abstraction does the opposite—it enriches meaning. When you see that two things have similar structures or behavior, then those similarities create a connection, a new meaning for you that wasn’t there before. Poincaré famously said that “mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things\".</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>“make your daughter practice math. She’ll thank you later.”13 The op-ed never asked the question of how to teach math so she’ll thank you now.</i></blockquote>\n\nThe list of values at the back is shockingly poorly conceptualised. But Su is a powerful analyst - just one rule for abstractions and another for humans. (<i>All I want</i> is humanism without sentimental overreach. It's unclear whether I can have this.)\n\nOne problem: he is too nice for me. (<i>“Let me start by thanking you, the reader, for taking the time to sit with this book and these ideas. Simone Weil said, “Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity”</i>) It's a very Christian book. Not in its metaphysics: in its intentional naivety, piety, humility, and cuddliness (though Weil and Buber and MacIntyre come up). He is credulous about the findings of educational psychology, including the absurd Pygmalion effect size. Every chapter includes a letter from a maths student in prison, the book ends with a long awkward interview with him, and Su gave some fraction of the royalties to him. One exception: chapter 9, a laudation for power. A huge number of smart people talk as if coercive power was the only sort. They are poisoned by paying too much attention to society.\n\nYears of study have still not given me the virtues Su rightly names - persistence, patience, disposition towards abstract beauty, gaman. Ain't giving up though.\n<blockquote><i>Maryam Mirzakhani... once said: “The beauty of mathematics only shows itself to more patient followers.\"</i></blockquote> I know.\n<blockquote><i>At my local hiking club, there’s bonding over a shared love of hiking. When it’s time to go, we split into different skill levels to do the hike at various speeds. I have no trouble admitting that I’m a slow hiker” By contrast, in mathematics the joy often requires the skill. </i></blockquote>\nBorcherds made me laugh: <blockquote><i>“I was over the moon when I proved the moonshine conjecture. If I get a good result I spend several days feeling really happy about it.</i></blockquote>Days!\n\nThe puzzles are all nice and can be solved in your head, a good property.

Both are admittedly the exquisite products of a decadent and vastly powerful empire. Both give a pretext to social engineers. But psychohistory <i>works</i>, and it’s interesting to consider why social science doesn’t. \r\n\r\nPart of it is the distinction between real science and the cargo cult kind:\r\n<blockquote><i>“It amounts to a diseased attitude—a conditioned reflex that shunts aside the independence of your minds whenever it is a question of opposing authority. There seems no doubt ever in your minds that the Emperor is more powerful than you are, or Hari Seldon wiser. And that’s wrong, don’t you see? … “It isn’t just you. It’s the whole Galaxy. Pirenne heard Lord Dorwin’s idea of scientific research. Lord Dorwin thought the way to be a good archaeologist was to read all the books on the subject—written by men who were dead for centuries. He thought that the way to solve archaeological puzzles was to weigh the opposing authorities. And Pirenne listened and made no objections” </i></blockquote>\r\nAs well as the distinction between \"scientific\" socialism and actual science.\r\n\r\nCan you think of a better way to doom a project than to convince its leadership that success is inevitable?\r\n\r\nNice touch: to make his forecast stable, Seldon has to impose a simple structure on his subjects - to predict by forcing the world to become predictable. (“That which is unstable we shall control.”)\r\n\r\nOne of Asimov’s vices is too closely allying intelligence and virtue. You can always tell a turncoat in this - before he turns - by his being a bit dim. Another is the repetitiveness and cliche of his historical cycles. He has the peripheral worlds turn to literal feudalism (“strange world! You have no peasantry”) before the tech Empire has even properly fallen. Seldon’s categories are well-worn and leave no room for social development and the weird shapes people grow into. The schlock religion which takes over the educated sector in less than 30 years was also pretty dumb.\r\n\r\nClumsy prose, almost entirely free of imagery. Identikit characters, largely smug. Starts weakly, ends abruptly in artless and pulpy fashion. Tune in next week.",

Asimov still can't do characters, but the Mule's lack of character is fitting, chilling - realistic for an authoritarian. Asimov is fit to write villains, in that sense.\n\nSeldon is by this point in the tale <i>identified</i> with history itself:\n<blockquote><i>\"you can't beat a Seldon crisis by a far-fetched, impractical, storybook scheme like that.

It's even foiled by genetics:\n<blockquote><i>Can a genetic accident of unpredictable biological properties be taken into account in the Seldon Plan? [No.]</i></blockquote>\n\n---\n\nThere's usually exactly one well-written passage in an Asimov book, and here it is:\n<blockquote><i>To him, a stilted geometric love of arrangement was \"system,\" an indefatigable and feverish interest in the pettiest facets of day-to-day bureaucracy was \"industry,\" indecision when right was \"caution,\" and blind stubbornness when wrong, \"determination.\" \n\nAnd withal he wasted no money, killed no man needlessly, and meant extremely well. </i></blockquote> \n(I explain this by A being a latently great writer who just never took the fucking time to be one.)\n\n---\n\nThe Mule is extremely rational... he just has a very fucked up goal (to rule the universe before he dies prematurely without progeny).

(It's only a model.)\r\n\r\nSurprisingly hippieish, Huxleyish, with it lauding mental science over physical science.\r\n<blockquote><i>in a society given over... to the physical sciences and inanimate technology, there was a vague but mighty sociological push away from the study of the mind</i></blockquote>\r\nThe obvious rejection is of behaviorism. But the main claim of psychohistory, of the predictability of the exact course of human history, goes way beyond behaviorism in some ways.\r\n\r\nThis is funny out of context:\r\n<blockquote><i>The Executive Council of the Second Foundation was in session. To us they are merely voices. Neither the exact scene of the meeting nor the identity of those present are essential at the point. \r\n\r\nNor, strictly speaking, can we even consider an exact reproduction of any part of the session - unless we wish to sacrifice completely even the minimum comprehensibility we have a right to expect. \r\n\r\nWe deal here with psychologists - and not merely psychologists. Let us say, rather, scientists with a psychological orientation. That is, men whose fundamental conception of scientific philosophy is pointed in an entirely different direction from all of the orientations we know.</i></blockquote>\r\nWe finally get some details about psychohistory.\r\n<blockquote><i>Psychohistory had been the development of mental science, the final mathematicization thereof, rather, which had finally succeeded. Through the development of the mathematics necessary to understand the facts of neural physiology and the electrochemistry of the nervous system, which themselves had to be, had to be, traced down to nuclear forces, it first became possible to truly develop psychology. And through the generalization of psychological \r\nknowledge from the individual to the group, sociology was also mathematicized. </i></blockquote>\r\nThe Seldon Plan has mumbo-jumbo mathematical derivations between steps, but he here admits that has of course been modified and falsified and had its assumptions violated. So it's not an apriori mathematical theory: it's a model. \r\n<blockquote><i>The Seldon Plan is neither complete nor correct... They've watched nearly four hundred years pass and against the predictions and equations, they've checked reality, and they have learned.</i></blockquote>\r\nReading between the lines, the Seldon Plan is what we now call a probabilistic program. (It's not just a DAG because it has forks and conditionals.) One distribution per planet, and about 30 million planets. This is about 10,000 times beyond current practical model sizes, but this is a weak objection. \r\n\r\nTheir adapting the plan over the centuries is obviously sane, and I'm glad to see Asimov's sense of realism here. But this also introduces massive overfitting risk! There is no test set for politics.\r\n\r\n(Ada Palmer's Brillists are Second Foundationers. Both slightly ridiculous, both overpowered and absurdly soft-peddling it.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne obvious note I missed until this third book is that Asimov isn't an authoritarian, and the Foundation is not his utopia. The Plan is the ultimate paternalism, and the Second Foundationeers' mind control the ultimate unaccountable authority. So Asimov is not in fact endorsing psychohistory and the Plan and the supremacy of scientists over all, including other scientists. Or if he is, he shouldn't be. \r\n<blockquote><i>The Second Empire is not yet formed. We have still a society which would resent a ruling class of psychologists, and which would fear its development and fight against it.</i></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><i>The Rossemites had blinked solemnly, uncertain of the word \"taxes.\" When collection time came, many had paid, or had stood by in confusion while the uniformed, other-wordlings loaded the harvested corn and the pelts on to the broad ground-cars. \r\n\r\nHere and there indignant peasants banded together and brought out ancient hunting weapons - but of this nothing ever came. Grumblingly they had disbanded when the men of Tazenda came and with dismay watched their hard struggle for existence become harder... The tax-farmers, Rossemites in the employ of Tazenda, came periodically, but they were creatures of custom now  and the peasant had learned how to hide his grain and drive his cattle into the forest, and refrain from having his hut appear too ostentatiously prosperous. Then with a dull, uncomprehending expression he would greet all sharp questioning as to his assets by merely pointing at what they could see. </i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne of his few pieces of good writing is the <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> scene where the farmers see the spaceship landing and rush to host the rich offworlders. \r\n<blockquote><i>She snuffled: \"It is a ship from outer space.\" \r\nAnd Narovi remarked impatiently: \"And what else could it be? We have visitors, old woman, \r\nvisitors!\" \r\nThe ship was sinking slowly to a landing on the bare frozen field in the northern portions of \r\nNarovi's farm. \r\n\"But what shall we do?\" gasped the woman. \"Can we offer these people hospitality? Is the dirt \r\nfloor of our hovel to be theirs and the pickings of last week's hoecake?\" \r\n\"Shall they then go to our neighbors?\"</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<spoiler>I don't like the fall of the Mule. You get this symbolic victory in fiction a lot - where the loser deduces the consequences of the current situation and stops fighting, offers up their throat. A real psycho, a real mule, would struggle irrationally until they were stopped.\r\n\r\nEven before his neutering, the motivation Asimov gives him - the ugly envious outsider kid looking for revenge - is too simplistic to be satisfying. (I accept that there seem to be such people.)</spoiler>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>What was it all for? And if he were the master of all there was - what then? Would it really stop men like Pritcher. from being straight and tall, self-confident, strong? Would Bail Channis lose his looks? Would he himself be other than he was?...\r\n\r\nThe internal ramifications of his physical deformity and mental uniqueness are obvious to all of us. </i></blockquote>\r\nOh yeah, people with deformities are obvious. He was way more effective with mysterious motives.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>it is always the characteristic of an elite that it possesses leisure as the great reward of its elitehood.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nFalse! And in his time.",

    "review": "Ten times better than a novel with this title should be; I finally get it. It is rammed full of religion but has even more real philosophy in it. It starts slow, but by p.150 the long philosophical dialogues flourish even as Card juggles six concurrent plot lines. He does the old great arguments about the greater good, political legitimacy, consciousness, metaethics, moral patiency, communitarianism, religion, embodiment, existentialism, freedom, a sort of game theory. Card is perfectly able to write good justified atheists, which implies something about his own faith. <spoiler>It takes a subtle Christian to write about a religion which is an explicitly engineered conspiratorial tool of social control.</spoiler> (Yes yes, he also solves its plot holes with faster-than-light metaphysical idealism, hippie oneness the long way round (\"all philotic twining is willed\"). But you don't need to accept a conclusion to admire an argument.) \r\n\r\nHighly quotable:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Human beings do metamorphose. They change their identity constantly. However, each new identity thrives on the delusion that it was always in possession of the body it has just conquered.\"\r\n\"Such changes are superficial. The nature of the organism remains the same. Humans are very proud of their changes, but every imagined transformation turns out to be a new set of excuses for behaving exactly as the individual has always behaved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had always thought that if only people could communicate mind-to-mind, eliminating the ambiguities of language, then understanding would be perfect and there'd be no more needless conflicts. Instead she had discovered that rather than magnifying differences between people, language might just as easily soften them, minimize them, smooth things over so that people could get along even though they really didn't understand each other. The illusion of comprehension allowed people to think they were more alike than they really were. Maybe language was better.\r\n\r\nCollectively, they're a collection of dolts. But in all their scurrying around and pretending to be wise, throwing out idiotic half-understood theories about this and that, one or two of them will come up with some idea that is just a little bit closer to the truth than what was already known. And in a sort of fumbling trial and error, about half the time the truth actually rises to the top and becomes accepted by people who still don't understand it, who simply adopt it as a new prejudice to be trusted blindly until the next dolt accidentally comes up with an improvement... no one is ever individually intelligent, and groups are even stupider than individuals-- and yet by keeping so many fools engaged in pretending to be intelligent, they still come up with some of the same results that an intelligent species would come up with. \r\n\r\nWhat he forgot was the way pious people had always reacted to insults against their god.\r\n\r\n\"Even the martyrs of Christianity and Islam were willing to accept rewards in heaven for their sacrifice,” said Valentine. \r\n“Then they were all selfish pigs...\"\r\n\r\nShe was a child of manual workers, and her hands, not her mind, held her future. Philosophy was as far above her as the sky was above the earth. \"But the sky only seems to be far away from you,\" said Master Han, when she told him this. \"Actually it is all around you. You breathe it in and you breathe it out, even when you labor with your hands in the mud. That is true philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nI have tasted the heat of many stars, and all of them were sweet.</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nIts philosophical moves are classic in the good (erudite) and bad (pre-modern) sense. Authenticity, essence, metaphysics, will, creativity as stamp of divinity:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"If I can't think original thoughts, does that mean that I'm nothing but a computer program that got out of hand?\"</i></blockquote>\r\nEveryone is in severe need of a notion of expected value (\"<i>you have no idea whether finding out what you are in order to save you will help or hurt those other projects</i>\"). \r\n\r\nThis passage was the first time I caught him making a howler, 360 pages in:\r\n<blockquote><i>\"Even if there is no such thing as free will, we have to treat each other as if there were free will in order to live together in society. Because otherwise, every time somebody does something terrible, you can't punish him, because he can't help it, because his genes or his environment or God made him do it, and every time somebody does something good, you can't honor him, because he was a puppet, too. If you think that everybody around you is a puppet, why bother talking to them at all? Why even try to plan anything or create anything, since everything you plan or create or desire or dream of is just acting out the script your puppeteer built into you.\"</i></blockquote>\r\nThis is a failure of imagination. Retribution is probably not in fact necessary to a society (while quarantine and rehabilitation are). Determinists can benefit from and suffer from all the usual evaluative stances towards their fellows and their own life; for instance I do.\r\n\r\nBut no matter: there are very few novelists who can handle philosophy this well, who can make ideas feel as important as they are, who can make the development of ideas a source of suspense as strong as a rapacious virus and a planet-killer.\r\n\r\nCard is much concerned with maximally passionate characters with tragically differing aims, so there are lots of flatly irrational moves despite its buckets of wisdom. Novinha in particular; I don't begrudge someone overpowering emotion, but it's hard to sympathise when they lose all proportion and fairness and compassion for weeks afterward. <spoiler>He really doesn't do enough to establish Quim's greatness; in fact I think there's exactly one scene where he's shown turning the other cheek and dispensing hard truths before he's killed.</spoiler> Qingdao is a great <i>brilliant irrationalist</i>: an eloquent and extended demonstration that intelligence and rationality can come apart. (She is also a wonderful portrayal of tragically <i>partial</i> success at overcoming classism.) And her dad is a master rationalist, who actually moves with the world.\r\n\r\nThere's a background hum of difference in it: Card's old-fashioned values / not being PC. His planet of so-called Daoists (actually fideist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)\">Legalists</a>) may strike some as unconscionably orientalist, because unlike a lot of intentionally diverse portrayals, it portrays an actually different (inegalitarian) culture, with service and social stability taking precedence over all else. \r\n<blockquote><i>First the gods. Second the ancestors. Third the people. Fourth the rulers. Last the self... we serve the rulers: because they serve the people, who serve the ancestors, who serve the gods... Fathers always decide everything... That's the beginning of wisdom.</i></blockquote>\r\n<spoiler>But note that the text pre-empts this. \r\n<blockquote><i>Donkeys, sedan chairs, all these trappings of ancient China--do the godspoken really think that such affectations make them somehow holier? Why don't they simply ride on fliers and hovercars like honest people do on every other world? Then Mu-pao would not have to humiliate herself, bouncing and jouncing on an animal that is suffering under her weight.</i></blockquote> \r\nThe rigid hierarchy of Path's eugenic Daoism is <i>imposed</i> on them by the evil empire. The orientalism is then not Card's but Congress's.</spoiler> I liked his cute fabricated idea of \"<a href=\"https://enderverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ancestor-of-the-heart\">ancestor-of-the-heart</a>\".\r\n\r\nHe's impressed with gender differences and the simple evo theory thereof. \r\n<blockquote><i>Our great civilizations are nothing more than social machines to create the ideal female setting, where a woman can count on stability; our legal and moral codes that try to abolish violence and promote permanence of ownership and enforce contracts -- those represent the primary female strategy, the taming of the male.</i></blockquote>\r\nA bitter, traumatised character says \"<i>Didn't you ever think I needed somebody to jolly me out of it sometimes?</i>\" which strikes me as cool and contrarian at this point. Card's conservatism is not the obvious kind, of abortions, guns, and America first, so maybe it won't strike many this way. \r\n\r\nIn praise of abstinence: \r\n<blockquote><i>Valentine had long ago observed that in a society that expected chastity and fidelity, like Lusitania, the adolescents who controlled and channeled their youthful passions were the ones who grew up to be both strong and civilized. Adolescents in such a community who were either too weak to control themselves or too contemptuous of society's norms to try usually ended up being either sheep or wolves - either mindless members of the herd or predators who took what they could and gave nothing.</i></blockquote> (The key caveat, which transforms the passage IMO, is \"that expected chastity\".)\r\n\r\nSick fundamentalism on Path:\r\n<blockquote><i>And it is certainly not up to us to decide whether it should exist--the gods have decreed that such a thing is possible and can exist.\"\r\n  \"So Demosthenes was right. The [genocide weapon] is with the fleet.\"\r\n  \"Yes.\"\r\n  \"And the government files that Demosthenes published--they were genuine.\"\r\n  \"Yes.\"\r\n  \"But Father--you joined many others in claiming that they were forgeries.\"\r\n  \"Just as the gods speak only to a chosen few, so the secrets of the rulers must be known only to those who will use the knowledge properly. Demosthenes was giving powerful secrets to people who were not fit to use them wisely, and so for the good of the people those secrets had to be withdrawn. The only way to retrieve a secret, once it is known, is to replace it with a lie; then the knowledge of the truth is once again your secret... he wishes to take power out of the hands of those whom the gods have ordained to rule humankind. What would happen to the people if they rejected the rulers given them by the gods?\" </i></blockquote>\r\nValentine is portrayed as a wise \"angel\" and a moral philosopher but actually she seems pretty naive to me, of the old unilateral-disarmament clean-hands school. \r\n<blockquote><i>\"What matters is -- should they blow up Lusitania?\"\r\n\"What kind of person are you?\" asked Valentine. He could hear both awe and loathing in her voice.\r\n\"You tell me. Are we supposed to love the [contagious aliens] so much that we allow the virus they carry to destroy all of humanity?\"\r\n...\"I choose to live in a universe that has some hope in it... It's wrong to even contemplate...\"</i></blockquote>\r\nBut Card can write her and Miro the bullet-biting consequentialist, and sympathise where I cannot. I start to wonder if he's really a theist, seeing the many pathologies of religion clearly as he does - and what greater compliment can I give his writing?\r\n\r\nI'm interested whether you could enjoy this without having read books 1 and 2; volunteers welcome.",
