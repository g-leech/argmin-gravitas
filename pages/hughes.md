Desire's a vicious separator in spite<br>
Of twisting women round men:<br>
Cold-chisels two selfs single as it welds hot<br>
Iron of their separates to one.<br>
<br>
Old Eden commonplace: something magnets<br>
And furnaces and with fierce<br>
Hammer-blows the one body on the other knits<br>
Till the division disappears.<br>
<br>
But desire outstrips those hands that a nothing fills,<br>
It dives into the opposite eyes,<br>
Plummets through blackouts of impassibles<br>
For the star that lights the face,<br>
<br>
Each body still straining to follow down<br>
The maelstrom dark of the other, their limbs flail<br>
Flesh and beat upon<br>
The inane everywhere of its obstacle,<br>
<br>
Each, each second, lonelier and further<br>
Falling alone through the endless<br>
Without-world of the other, though both here<br>
Twist so close they choke their cries.<br>
