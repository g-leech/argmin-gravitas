#### __botany and ultimate reality__

Selection pressures we don't really understand led the deerhorn clarkia to have strangely oblong pollen This increased its fitness for the task of "Robert Brown picking it"

Bachelier modeled the process called Brownian. With some probability, Einstein read that. Wiener read that that. Itô read that that that.

The stochastic calculus was made during the war. It describes all random events. that is, it describes.

When I was young and ignorant of the taste of sorrow 
I loved to scale the roofs
Yes, I scaled the roofs
To compose new verses I feigned my woe.

Now I understand sorrow’s flavours
I can’t find the words
Yes, I can’t find the words
Instead: 'What a cool day! Such lovely autumn weather!'

少年不識愁滋味 
愛上層樓
愛上層樓 
為赋新詞強說愁

而今識盡愁滋味 
欲說還休
欲說還休 
卻道天凉好個秋

#### __self portrait__


_How did I get here?_

Got out the cave quite easily
- actually a lot of people leave the cave. that whole rebel "cave sucks!!" phase. but it's cold out so you think better. but right outside is a door you can't push open.

I realised that radicalism does nothing
I realised that bureaucracy does nothing
I realised that government is bureaucracy
I was treated unjustly by social justice and made to not imagine i have no enemies

- I realised that books are small and art is small and secondary and phantomish I realised that there is a way out of the cage of philosophy I realised that science too does almost nothing

<br>

_Why so hard to work on what I should?_

Of course it hurts! I am giving birth<br>
as well as lifting the object I am also carrying myself on my back

<br>

_What am I?_

I am not a grounder, a tower builder, an explorer, an astronaut, a rotator
I am a
    -   sprinter
    -   thought experimentalist
    - association engine
    - mascot
    - expositor
        - ladderman. dragging the ladder down for others
    - curator
        - eddington. thresher. searcher. finder.

#### __fancy__


My nation is a dress uniform, like all nations. Distinctive, colourful, old, mass-produced. Six sizes too big. If I wear it I am legible to you, you I haven't met. It veils me when I meet you and don't want to be met by you. It lives in the cupboard (I don't have to meet many people). <br>

It's usually nice to own it - something to don when surrounded by notional barbarians, to set myself apart in my different barbarism. <br>

Though often people point to it, saying that I <i>am</i> my frock coat, or that I'm wearing my frock coat when I'm not wearing it. This isn't fun, as no forced game is fun. At least my coat isn't caked in shit and blood, like yours. (Like all coats, it <i>is</i> caked in shit and blood, but at least mine isn't on the outside.)<br>

Like all regiments, my regiment thinks it is special: not many people have these coats. But wearing any coat makes you less rare: you leave your kingdom singly for a low foothold on Leviathan.<br>

No one will spit on my coat, unlike yours. It is humble and demotic. The regiment's crimes were quiet, or loud with none left to say. <br>

Frock coats are new. There are no frock coats, we just pretend we're wearing frock coats to humour each other. It is cold without them. But it it wouldn't be, if you stood like so before yours, as it burned. Say, can you see?

#### __thole thule__
<!-- 2017-05-13 -->

Pale rulered ceiling low. <br>
The fog a second sky at ten paces.<br>
Your breath a third foglet.<br>
You'd review harshly a film ending <br>
among this melodramatic a cloud chamber,<br>
lazy with meteorological ellipsis.<br><br>

Away, you forget endmost<br>
Grampian, the uniformity and wall-eyed mist.<br>
Back, grey cries for colour: quayside tattoos, <br>
neon dye, Jäger. Colour isn't given.<br><br>

Nae thermo, nae sae dynamic. (Ootside, onywoy.) <br>
Folk thole the grey reef lang enou, <br>
puddle in the sea, hoovering <br>
at livid macroeconomic cracks. <br>
Abdy oxidates, no white-het but blue.<br>
A'hin blurs. A'hin levels. A'hin mixes. A'hin cools.

#### __incentive compatibility__
<!-- 2017-03-19 -->

We live together: you dislike mess more than cleaning; I dislike cleaning more than mess. Mess happens: obligate social grooming rears a silent scowling face.<br>

A current account runs to deficit: cogwheels backlash. I could offer you money for doing my part, if I was stupid; or if you were a different species. As you are this is a grave insult: cleaning you undertake yourself is home-making, comfort behaviour, preening, an act conceived in freedom and ease. Receiving money for it makes you a cleaner: low-status. Offering money called you low status: I signalled wealth, dominance. Negotiations sour: you don't hear my offer instead to cook, or do the bins. But we are grown men; there must be a solution.<br>

Yes: I skip the lease under cover of night, free-riding the axle of a Scania bound for the orient. In the morning: notes stuffed under your door.


<br><br><br><br><br>

#### __to be led out__
<!-- 2017-03-18 -->

You start to learn something. You don't know what to google. You don't know the luminaries.

You don't know what are stupid questions. You don't know which are the good books, and they are all £90. You might not know a good book when you saw it, except that it seems to make sense to you, where others are demeaning slammed doors. You don't know enough to just get started and incrementally improve at any rate at all.<br> 

Education is artificial enclosures and screens on this terrifying commons: ignore those cliffs, forget that vertiginous sky, stay in here, you will be safe to get strong, here is a nice story. <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">StackExchange</a> is a chain of lifeboats on the open sea of research, vanishing to the horizon.<br>

Most educated people never leave the enclosures, and mistake the limits of the curriculum for the limits of the world. (In this way, it's possible that the American general education philosophy - so admirable, so civic - could narrow minds.) In economics this "101ism" is particularly pernicious, since even honest specialists, those operating well beyond the screen, can't communicate their technical results to the media, so almost all discourse takes place inside the fake, narrow enclosure, with endless fruitless illiberal results.<br>


In fields where it's impossible to know if you have gone astray - everything except the formal sciences - the work feels nicer but is sadder, considered on a proper timescale, of centuries. There it is almost inevitable that lives will be ploughed into the soil and merge with the stream of decomposing misguided theses. In the formal sciences this is only very likely.

<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __Ode to Experian, Equifax, Epsilon, Acxiom, Rapleaf, Phorm, Cambridge Analytica, and Palantir__


sun the sky. your points held out<br>
to any who care to spend a penny<br>
upon your little perch upon the cloud.<br>

everything said already. <br>
but no one heard. it will be held down now,<br>
in index and coin roll, come again.<br>

someone is watching. I am found <br>
and weighed and found to be <br>
several hundred out of <i>NaN</i>. Merchantable!<br>

at least someone is watching. <br>
Past a long lack, we know<br>
There is a market of authorities<br>

Seeking you desperately<br>
knowing you more or less than you,<br>
ought you be flattered really<br>

omni-nothing, never-knowing, precarious <br>
despite their M3 millions, e-score milliards <br>
and what exa-peta-points of you they could snap.<br>

See they <i>are</i> big brother, but dead at fourteen<br>
of gaucheness and ick hubris. someone at least is telling <br>
something to be watching, and that is as good as it gets.

#### __uluburun__
<!-- 2016-12-18 -->

<br>
<u>I. <i>Loss versus disposal versus deposition</i></u><br><br>

<blockquote><small>
<i>from the common [Bronze Age] man’s perspective, the Uluburun<br> shipment 
would be hard to imagine: a thousand years of salary... <br>
</i></small>
</blockquote>
-- Christopher Monroe


<br>

Not not betrayed. Not not pirated.<br>
Not not sunk. Not not turned to air.<br>
Not the luxury of meaninglessness.<br>
Nothing the cape. Nothing will be said. <br><br>

All rare things holy<br>
But we _were_ these things.<br>
Never mind his lordship.<br>
Hundreds of talents.

No reason for thousands of years nor then.<br><br>

you internationalist canoe.<br>
Gold over glass over tin over fist.<br>
Ugarit. Enkomi. Nefertiti.<br>

This shares properties with me, so it is good. That has properties beyond my properties, so it is good.
<br><br><br><br><br>


<u>II. <i>Commerce versus gift versus tribute</i></u><br><br>

<blockquote><small>
<i>The collapse of Bronze Age civilization in about 1200 BC, just<br>
one century after the Uluburun wreck, happened with surprising swiftness. <br>
Within fifty years, multiple kingdoms and empires crumbled.</i></small>
</blockquote>
-- James Rickards

<br>

My documents<br>
Fact into law<br>
Sand into glass

Object embody categories for people. How does material exchange occur across value systems?
<br>
- Either not much variation on the key things, because of common survival imperative (bounded cultural variation)<br>
- Or fundamentally because no trade occurs between value systems, even on the individual to individual; it occurs where I value your thing more than my thing and vice versa.


So much can only be homage or ransom<br>
or a dowry for all of your women.<br><br><br><br>

<u>III. <i>Raw versus intermediate versus finished</i></u><br><br>


<u>IV. <i>Whole versus scraps</i></u><br><br>
<br>


<u>V. <i>Icon versus tool</i></u><br><br>

<blockquote><small>
<i>...Go quickly,<br>
examine the hoard under the grey stone,<br>
dear Wiglaf, now the wyrm lies dead -<br>
sleeping sorely, deprived of treasure.<br>
Make haste, that I the ancient wealth,<br>
the possession of gold might perceive, and readily behold<br>
sparkling clever gems, that I can more pleasantly<br>
for treasure leave my<br>
life and nation, that long I ruled.</i></small>
</blockquote>
-- Beowulf

<br>


Far from the trees - far yet from the town -<br>
Bizarrely successful tall mammals rained down.<br>
A puckle of palaces, a legion of pigs<br>
Culture: banana, pointing at figs.<br><br>


Destroying a sacred object destroys part of your identity.

A whole town's GDP, lost. That is not the term to use to get you to care: the whole harvest, a large chunk of your life's work, your children's bellies. Everyone you know ruined for life.

#### __generally__

<!-- 2016-01-08 -->

the only beautiful object, event, or abstraction<br>
of any kind within shooting distance of Riga airport<br>
is the spew of a squat smokestack, <br>
a pure grey stream of hot sideshow.<br>
parthenogenetic and progeroid.<br>

a boiled definition, lit to make<br>
many monochromes wash out, <br>
a collective paling, lines breaking, becoming<br>
the static milk-blue back of this, a winter.<br>
beside it snow is mute. clouds don't intrude.<br>

and I could study this! <i>Really</i>; not by eye<br>
or for mere art. Given the itch persisting<br>
I might spend a week with the profound and careful dead. <br>
the vapour painting has a million twins running<br>
the selfsame script of physical law, probably known;<br>

on average each twin seen truly.<br>
we found out the world without us. made it reel.<br>
what's written in the flames underneath<br>
chokes mutely. my stoichiometrist mate<br>
can code its dead language in a trice.<br>

it solves for seven unknowns, but can be given <br>
in the eternal manner since Boyle or Navier-Stokes<br>
who solved mysteries you would have been satisfied with<br>
-- <i>are</i> satisfied with, since ignorant amidst free knowledge -<br> 
which mysteries I am seen enjoying in the first two stanzas.<br>

macro effects ongoing on the frontage, temperature and health<br>
of Riga <i>etc</i> are knowable but not known and not soon.<br>
Dark guesses nailed on the door. The models lift off, freed from obvious <br>
falsehood by tiny effects in giant interactions <br>
so we think what we happily will.
<br>

the present effect - one unit of pleasure and motive<br>
in a youngish half-educated traveller - is known, shakily, in principle,<br>
from parts outside: sparkling in my C fibres or Hebbian knots or GABA wheels. <br>
even the heart may be knowable <br>
given much stronger light.<br>

in the absence of peak oil, the absence of monkey-wrenchers,<br>
in the presence of the deep absence<br>
that airports consist in, a cloud factory churns. <br>
it ignores my head, dipped in notebook; ignores the folly and doom <br>
symbolism people give it; ignores everything except pressures, gravities, van der Waals <br>

and future soon.

#### __the problem with other minds__
<!-- 2015-10-11 -->

I don't know what you're thinking, of course. Some people make much of this; all our thousands of languages are supposed to be bridges, however rickety and thin; half of all real and imagined tragedies turn on miscommunication; a large branch of world philosophy obsesses over the Angst of Being and the distant Other, incomprehensible, deep and sad.

The harsh light of <a href="#the_law" epub-type="stretchsummary">Sturgeon's law</a> is a great comfort here, since it implies we aren't missing much. 'It's no tragedy I am deaf by default if the world comprises mostly noise. Essential solitude is just a grander version of not having Twitter.'

But also that, were humanity better than it is - more thoughtful, more caring, more original, funnier - the situation would be <i>more</i> tragic. Because the feeling I have of missing out on you all would be, well, justified.

#### __"To sing in green"__ by Hugo von Hofmannsthal
<!-- 2015-01-30 -->

I<br />

Didn’t you hear, in here,<br />
How music prowled the house?<br />
The night was hard and lightless<br />
But out there on a stiff stone<br />
larking – that was me.<br />
<br />
I said all I could:<br />
"Dear, you're everything to me!"<br />
But the east shoved out new light<br />
and the harsh day drove me home.<br />
My mouth was shut again.<br />
<br />

II<br />

Under a murky weighted sky<br />
So lonely we were,<br />
Cleaved from the other!<br />
But no more:<br />
The air blows free and fro;<br />
And the whole world inamidst us<br />
Shines as if glass.
<br /><br />
The stars arose, were<br />
Shown shimmering on us,<br />
And even they knew:<br />
So strong and stronger their splendour<br />
That we sighed,<br />
Lay blissful, captured<br />
by other's touch.<br />
<br />


III

My beloved spoke: "I'll not block you;<br />
You owe me nothing.<br />
Folk should not be kept –<br />
They weren't born to trust so.
<br /><br />
Hit the road, my friend,<br />
Behold land upon land<br />
Try out many beds<br />
Take many women by the hand.<br />
<br />
If a wine’s too sour for you,<br />
Go drink Malvasia –<br />
But if my mouth is sweeter,<br />
Only then come to me!”<br />

Christ. Reach me a nothing,<br />
save me a stay!<br /><br />
If you are given pause — if<br />
you give me a bed larger than I need<br />
and heed the answer retrodicted —<br />
you will brush the wrecks of timetables from me,<br />
wash my shoulders of lead,<br />
and see in me hot and fragile seas.<br /><br />
To leave me ungeneralised.

<i> for Qiu Ji</i><br /><br />

Sky emptied, the autumn cloud thins;<br />
A west wind spans a myriad fields.<br />
The morning scene is good — cleared:<br />
Long rain has left us land.<br />
Tight willows show sparse green,<br />
Uphill, pears are flowering red.<br />
Upstairs, a reed pipe plays;<br />
One goose rises in plain air.<br />

Speak now of the soul's ratchets and the stirred Stakhanovite silt<br />
of the bed of&nbsp;this generation.&nbsp;of pitiless benevolence. <br />
<br />
Ratchet, reason; ratchet, ruck; <br />
Progress slow through dry valleys, slow as<br />
<br />
Fate; despicably kind. vegan cynic,<br />
now shame meagre wealth,<br />
<br />
Now balk at cost of consistency<br />
now strike, wages of sin;<br />
<br />
Now maximise like fatcat<br />
now route cold virtue road;<br />
<br />
Now niggle, now coin<br />
now manumit the tenderloin;<br />
<br />
Now not sit still<br />
to tunes ignored.

#### __Union Terrace Gardens #2__
<!-- 2013-06-23 -->

Three teens unshaded&nbsp;sodden<br />
in brief brilliance<br />
crane at youtube's tinny cauldron<br />
-- brighter, greener, bustier<br />
than&nbsp;the park reprieved.<br />
<br />
Fair enough spillover<br />
living public living room;<br />
<em>I</em> crane at miserable book<br />
– drabber, greyer than park concrète –<br />
and, supposedly, at world to come.

#### __no: dyce__
<!-- 2013-06-10 -->

Walking hard shoulders toward my early town through dew, fog, find a white cd-r in the carriageway grass. Thrown from a car. Rain-stained, smeary <i>Saucerful of Secrets. </i>'That's fucking enough.'

<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __employ__
<!-- 2013-05-16 -->

Speak unfree, acquiesce to excellence;<br />
artifice a&nbsp;quarter of your short time; disown time; <br />
foreclose all weeks;<br />
existential deodorant, and woe betide<br />
who sweats out loud. <br />
cleaved in two at one end - tool by day, stub by night;<br />
out of history in circular gyre;<br />
divest, discharge, weekend; <br />
leave style at threshold, dream at car-door:<br />
make it matter.

### NaPoWriMo 2013 (one poem per day)

<br>

#### __as per__
<!-- 2013-04-22 -->

writing, <br />
as per usual, of journeys, remembrance, death, love<br />
stars, blood, soul. on you&nbsp;go again.<br />
<br />
these<br />
the whole of your poetry<br />
a corner of the real potential world.<br />
<br />
advances?<br />
Whitman's prancing, Breton's vomit,<br />
Ginsberg's pissy apocalypse?<br />
<br />
collapse<br />
severed prose for lazy ponces <br />
selected razors for slight minds.<br />
<br />
poems<br />
are allergic living. Write about normality all you like<br />
it's no realer for the description.<br />
<br />
gaze<br />
word-wrapping repels ordinariness,<br />
negates as it affirms.<br />
<br />
glory<br />
in&nbsp;ordinary life -- more than I can manage.<br />
I'm not strong enough to be happy with just sense.


<br><br><br><br><br>



#### __rancour__
<!-- 2013-04-22 -->

I am the offending article.<br />
<br />
So redescribed, transmuted,<br />
I haunt, heedless, automatic, unfeeling.<br />
My actions are oppressive.<br />
The memory of my actions is oppressive.<br />
My gaze is oppressive.<br />
The idea of my gaze is oppressive.<br />
My existing oppresses.<br />
My longevity&nbsp;promises to.<br />
I am deep in debt and they do not <br />
make my currency anymore.<br />
<br />
So I sing, must thus roll.

#### __demon denominalisations, or, the vicious verbing__
<!-- 2013-04-22 -->

Suddenly monied,<br />
we got pilled-up:<br />

He necked them all<br />
so I kneed him.<br />

Newly enemied, he knifed me;<br />
Newly knifed, he was unfriended.<br />

He gunned me for my demogoguing;<br />
I gerrymandered his face.<br />

Entreating, he sexted sexily<br />
(I pencilled it in).<br />

We dialogued long, drank our dranks,<br />
youtubed the workshopped process.<br />

Newly employed by shady intelligencers<br />
We actioned when ordered.<br />

Renditioneering, they quickly<br />
signatured what we told them to signature. <br />

We will all nuke together we we nuke.<br />
It will impact you but not for long.

#### __heave me away with light iron__
<!-- 2013-04-05 -->


Sometimes I say I love irony,<br />
though he'd call me a poof if he overheard.<br />
I suppose I should not love him.<br />
<br />
But he's more than a sarky sneer&nbsp;at&nbsp;our soft places:<br />
he is the hope of other minds, <br />
Pyrrho in&nbsp;a harness&nbsp;put out to till the fields.<br />
<br />
Bewilder me, world, unseat and unsex,<br />
lead me through&nbsp;cognitive forests&nbsp;with two clearings only:<br />
sweet ironism&nbsp;or pure reason.<br />
<br />
In the end I cannot dissolve.<br />
The power now&nbsp;vested is&nbsp;worse&nbsp;vested elsewhere.<br />
Strong admiration of irony is my distance from his distance.

#### __Poem inscribed on some Undies__
<!-- 2012-12-29 -->

<i>[Right cup]</i><br />
You are my wild orchids;<br />
you were my deep confusion.<br />
you soothe and, better, kill<br />
the prude, the prig and puritan I am.<br />
you dance though asleep, <br />
off line in lieu.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>[Left cup]</i><br />
I bear the happy cross self-expression; <br />
I welcome piercing - but shy from mother's mind, <br />
pert haptics &amp; most people most times.<br />
I fill finery because nothing<br />
else makes sense, or rings out <br />
so sweetly above the&nbsp;racket of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>[Briefs]</i><br />
I am what goes beneath,<br />
closer to the middle<br />
of an unpretending life -<br />
and, in our instance,<br />
closer even to the heart.<br />
right in the thicket of it.

<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __cheap mental health__
<!-- 2012-12-29 -->

my people are as they are because they shrink from<br />
small sources of cheap mental health<br />
available to things like us:<br />
<br />
exercise, stupid art,<br />
bold conjectures, pissing outside, <br />
uppers, group affiliation,<br />
coupling, writing about yourself,<br />
laughter, early nights,<br />
framing one's pain as the small pain it is,<br />
eating right, and embodying your morals.<br />
<br />
(participation)


<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __no man is a nation__
<!-- 2012-12-29 -->


I'd like to distinguish myself &amp; Scotland. But can I?<br />
Seems easy: he, Scotland, is thirty-thousand miles big<br />
&amp; likes oil, bankers, and distorting history;<br />
I, Nemo, am a hundred percent nothing<br />
&amp; like sunlight, empiricism and meat-free things.<br />
But I am belched forth from him,<br />
filled with his faults and his smells I cannot smell,<br />
and we both say we crave independence,<br />
(though mine's from Britain and<i>&nbsp;</i>Scotland both).


<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __and thence fall into jobs that feed the bourgeois nation-state__

<blockquote>

-- Carl Hancock Rux

<br>

Hey! hark at their coming, oi! quake at their bells:<br />
it's those buggering jobs that feed&nbsp;the Bourgeois Nation-State.<br />
<br />
what dyou think you are doing! where do you <em>think</em> your work goes!<br />
all clocked hours,&nbsp;all leisures feed&nbsp;the Bourgeois Nation-State.<br />
<br />
it'll eat all progression, use up your every ounce,<br />
that&nbsp;repressively tolerant Bourgeois Nation-State.<br />
<br />
profane your enjoyments, o racist roundabout;<br />
orgiastic job creation&nbsp;for the&nbsp;Bourgeois Nation-State.<br />
<br />
o resist them do deny them please, Buy Nothing and&nbsp;bite back,<br />
say boo to all its agents and flash them your arsecrack;<br />
<br />
o&nbsp;sweet&nbsp;cultural studies,&nbsp;o&nbsp;countercultural airs,<br />
o student with that One&nbsp;Idea and intentions fair,<br />
<br />
does your garden grow purely, organic,&nbsp;and innate?<br />
does your ignored critique&nbsp;starve out&nbsp;the Bourgeois Nation-State?


<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __having just graduated__
<!-- 2012-10-10 -->


having 'just' graduated I'm just<br />
a ghoul on campus, a drunk who's lost&nbsp;a bet, and<br />
happy, though just <br />
an upturned Transit&nbsp;just spinning its wheels through long air guitar miles.<br />
<br />
see some other dregs, just <br />
magnetic years&nbsp;giving structure&nbsp;to <br />
the&nbsp;idle&nbsp;existentialist, the hopeless arriviste,<br />
the butch mens sana, and I,&nbsp;tiny colossus.<br />
<br />
each just a graduate, just<br />
straining to hear a song just&nbsp;stopped,<br />
in&nbsp;this bright young world entirely <br />
unchanged by us.


<br><br><br><br><br>





#### __Mzungu__
<!-- 2012-06-03 -->

What goes through you
When you call me my race?

Not malice, I know,
Not avarice mostly 
Not even always predication –
leaving what?

“Mzungu!” joy of novelty<br>
“Mzungu!” lay your voice on the outside world<br>
“Mzungu!” to be seen by The Mzungu, distant source on earth of stuff.

I do not hear any of that
(pallards: thin-skinned)<br>
I grimace at you, fight indifference 
walk on.


<br><br><br><br><br>

#### __the kabootar in flight__


What lasts?

-- not harmless cheek (the hidden key to grand toilets),
by definition

-- actual education (none here, 1000 kids given an inkling of an inkling)
does, for a bit

-- concussion (the price of adventure you paid for us)
won't, touch wood

-- massage (a sudden kind thumb)
rare and brief

no. what lasts is the harsh heat of family's hand,<br>
the undying vampire queen London, mathematics, <br>
and sometimes the memory of friends,<br>
the kabootar in flight.

<br><br>
[For Rohit Rajput]

<!-- 

#### Atcha

Brit takes snap

of scowling ragclad local;
local whips out phone
to snap back.


#### Crowned 

Each home’s heralded by banana trees
sure sign, omen and birthmark.

That crown of food, enclosed 
but humane, not fences.

Living close to the land
Means close to scorp and tetanus.

But that’s not all.


#### Mnyauko

The banana’s a-dying.
Blight rots them on the tree,
millions on poor millions.

Research snails along,
sluggish as usual
re: the poor's problems.

Locals whisper/hypothesise
that aids has switched its 
grip from people, to trees.

The despair is&nbsp;
scarcely less&nbsp;
for it.


#### West</b>


Irony our strong suit

trump suit, sole suit.

It is how we tell apart our people
from those still with hope,

stupid kindness,
alternative visions.


#### gender sensitization

“how can this happen?”
Well whips are not needed most of the time 

in most places.
just keep women afraid, 
keep them unread,
keep them unpaid,

keep them at home

keep them tired

keep their children

and you keep them.



“why do men do this?”



We don’t know and nor do they.




#### some colours

some houses empty shambles, sweat all round,
laborious housekeep, and smoke all round,
some everythings shoddy, and dust all round,
women, no cattle, and illness all round


- but flowers are flowers
clean bright and
equal. Some colours glow against
backgrounds darkly. Some colours are freeing,
lift burdens. Some colours bless&nbsp;
an efficacious&nbsp;blessing, for once.

#### __Perth / Dundee__
<!-- 2012-05-25 -->


hard, dark and<br />
hardly started<br />

familiar<br />
crap bus distorting our demesne<br />

Perth? Dundee?<br />
I should know but know you don't know<br />

frantic, the<br />
yellow-spot-road, and vague places past it<br />

note: ticket<br />
includes each other on tap<br />

but legroom<br />
and peace aren't included<br />

we cargo<br />
are silent, hummed and whined and shook from sleep<br />

lesson: no<br />
lesson, I just wanted you to know

#### __who gradually wasn't__
<!-- 2012-05-25 -->


First she lost her beepcard<br />
(so beepdoors didn't know her)<br />
<br />
then she lost her licence<br />
(the road no longer hers)<br />
<br />
next she lost her passport<br />
(was trapped inside one border)<br />
<br />
<i>and </i>she lost her phone<br />
(and distant friends went mute)<br />
<br />
losing then the&nbsp;wallet<br />
(goods and comfort blanked her)<br />
<br />
she went and lost her cloud<br />
(the past, what would've come)<br />
<br />
then she lost her throat chords<br />
(couldn't invoke absent things)<br />
<br />
her breasts and other jumbles<br />
(she was proclaimed unsexed)<br />
<br />
and last lost all her body<br />
(so sat godlike, and vexed)

#### __L'immobiliare__
<!-- 2012-04-15 -->


In Italy they call estate agents<br />
immobilisers<br />
and so they are,<br />
wormed deep as they are<br />
into the unspoken plan path<br />
of almost everyone.<br />
<br />
It is not mostly via vices<br />
or secrets that they get us<br />
but by our dreams.

<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __critique__
<!-- 2012-04-14 -->


Come, please, do! I am open to critique!<br />
Truth was my first wife!<br />
(But queue yourselves,<br />
and come slowly,<br />
along my line of sight,<br />
and wait for the nod,<br />
and punch with your hand open,<br />
on limbs that were anyway gangrenous<br />
and do not leer.)

I see they've cloned a baby.<br />They've put ten mice on crack!<br />They know what causes rainfall now -<br />They've fixed your grandad's back!<br /><br />They'll go too far if you ask me<br />They can't control it all.<br />So while they fill up the TV<br />I'll off await the fall.

but I'm not bound by one set<br />

<strong>Name:</strong> Not Clive James

<strong>Age:</strong> Missed most of the Twentieth Century

<strong>Address:</strong> Almost nowhere, really.

<strong>Nationality:</strong> Not a great deal. I don't participate in Scottish culture, any more than I have to by merit of enculturation.

<strong>Languages:</strong> Can't speak Gaelic, Spanish, Cornish, Saxon, nor...

<strong>Work: </strong>I've never had a full-time job.

<strong>Non-interests: </strong>Sport, war, Tarski, collecting anything, scale-modelling, surfing, bell-ringing, spelunking.

<strong>Education lapses:</strong>

<em>Secondary: </em>No economics, no philosophy, no gender, no business studies, no psychology, no politics, no French, no Chinese, no grammar (properly). I'm also quite bad at geography.

<em>Tertiary: </em>No law, no computing, no engineering, no geology, no medical, no pure maths.

I've surveyed no field - nor any phenomenon, physical, cultural, or other. I know nothing of Nussbaum, I am ignorant of Avenarius, I haven't a clue about Conway. I've contributed nothing to either the mainstream nor dissenting schools of economic thought.<br /><br />I've never read Hemingway, Goethe, Brookner, Isherwood - nor anything from the Harlem Renaissance (nor much of the Euro Renaissance) - nor Houellebecq, Duras, Vargos Llosa, Thackaray, Musil, Bainbridge, Naipaul, that Girl With the Dragon stuff, Zola, Behn, Updike, Wolfe, Richardson, Barth, Byatt, Bellow, Brecht, Kazantzakis, Paz - almost no Classical stuff - Smollett, Wharton, Trollope, Nin, neither Amis, Eco, Roth, Coetzee, Tóibín, no Christie or Hammett, nothing I could afterwards identify as "chicklit" (except Austen?) and, despite heroic efforts, I have not yet successfully climbed a Pynchon.<br /><br />There are also a vast number of things I do not know that I don't know about. (I imagine.)<br /><br />

#### __Who Am I?__
<!-- Jan 2010 -->

> "It's easy hatin yourself, it's hard makin it rhyme"

<br>
 
I am the word made flesh (lowly CTAGCCGATCATT)

DNA is a candle and I am is so much

evaporating wax

I'm words and words are dancers

Flowing over their ink

Under their maybe-meanings.

I'll never be there for anyone if I don't

somehow stay still.

Everything anyone's 

Ever said about me

is true.

In my forced condescension, my needy generosity,

false modesty, false arrogance

"I gave my heart before I knew what it was"

organs it attached to.

Not informed of hands nor feet,

I shattered your fingers. It'll happen.

I am a clenched fist in glass gloves,

an intellect insinuating; a missing accent.

I am a grasping heaving frowner;

the dissatisfied have always been on top,

we tutters, bleeders, wankers. What thinking!<br>

I dance to a done tune.

You to an unwritten one.

<br><br><br><br><br>



#### __booty__
<!-- 16th June 2010 -->


two drag a chest.<br />
inside, treasure rotting.<br />
each prickles within rights.<br />
wonders if the other peeks.<br />
wonders if they know they do.<br />
neither escapes. one doesn't want to.<br />
they bear it. they've counted thirty paces.<br />
dig new at two Xs.


<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __WORDS I WOULD NOT OTHERWISE SAY__
<!-- June 2010 -->

Disbelief makes me solemn;<br />you are a serious matter<br />I've no hope to solve.<br />(a paralysing sequent)<br />
Your hands are absurdities<br />for they contradict my skin<br />and from them anything follows.<br /><br />I can say the words but they're<br />empty names, real but not realised.<br />
The delight scalds me. 

<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __'GLOBAL HUB'__
<!-- June 2010 -->

Studiedly nothing

Smiling, we let our youth pass<br>
And smiling did recline<br>
Swivel chairs were not worth it<br>
(Style over backbone by design).<br>

There's a gamut, too<br>
-- Superlunary or syndicalist<br>
Or Cistercian or something -<br>
Where the cordon between degrees<br>

Bleeds through, and unity can be<br>
Noted if not attained.<br>
Mind-bags and little else,<br>
We probe behind glass<br>

(Everyone's a scientist of their friends)<br>
No need for much; a crossword, ice tea,<br>
State-backed leisure,<br>
less of your lip, poet,<br>

Spuriously all things.

<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __PRESENTISM__
<!-- 20th May 2010 -->

A rolling limit on it all, wide as world,<br />effortless Shiva-Brahma, Now.<br /><br />Entire<br />entire anew<br />entire anew everything<br />instantly entirely<br />sleight.<br /><br />times pass and pass away<br />we pass, and now flies<br />the tick.<br /><br />it is cold, the godclock;<br />its truths are transiences.<br />it'll allow you only a moment,<br />the moment, and fling<br />juxtapositions unexplaineds halfperceiveds<br />rushed right by finalities beautiful firsts<br />ephemera and quantum bullshit at you<br />for observation,<br />though more like for not.<br /><br />The past cannot save,<br />the future cannot promise.<br /><br />Fuck Zen,<br />sight without a backbone in one's eyes.<br />Now, not Tao.<br />More than shallow, divorcing Zen;<br />the dead men you consort and tussle with<br />are at your elbow,<br />waiting for us to forget.<br /><br />Only what is present is and all that is is present.<br /><br />This, time's null-series and<br />its dynamic hindtruth:<br />bug-eyed, austere, and punk.<br />


<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __OUR MAENAD__
<!-- 20th May 2010 -->

Then howling, then lowing,<br />she donned quick dull and bedded -<br />but did not settle - down,<br /><br />in a feu de tristesse. There's no<br />choicer torturers than selves.<br />It's masturbation for clean hands.<br /><br />Endlessly dressing; life as vanity table<br />in an alcove offstage (ever offstage).<br />Words will do for clothing in a pinch.<br /><br />Of late what words they are! Silken<br />Armour and feather helmets,<br />a ridiculous expressionist war.<br /><br />Sparagmos! the jubilant wrong<br />that we'll pause by, observing rites<br />over rights. Drink deep, fill your boots.<br /><br />Impress, prepossess, distance;<br />petition from the surface.<br />I hate it when you say it's only skin.<br /><br />Valuable, people. Opaque, though, so much so<br />that muck that covers brass; all is muck<br />if you never scratch it, and reason seems alone. 

<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __home school__
<!-- Feb 2010 -->

needing parental permission slip signed to read Sophocles.<br>
Near world, well-meaning, nominally <br>
the diversity of parental belief. <br>
how many years the instantiated? very little goes away. <br>
How much of me was decided has branded itself on my mind in my hand. <br>
When parents die early I will not need to; the begetter's whim  <br>
Shall I ask my ailing father if I may when I am 50? <br>
When my children ask me, will I pass their request upwards?

<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __35%__
<!-- Feb 2010 -->

I have been told of things. Almost everything in my head I have been told; of an a passive brickie, handed material (begrodying study and expected to conclude as I should. 

Some of the things recently mortared-in are in are destructive tellings, however. They undermine and pry, never settle and never dry. Possible worlds. Idealism. Imperceptibles. Anarchic science and slave moralities.

Philosophy is a downpour on the construction site, or maybe it only reveals the rain.

Children of one multiply-sclerotic parent have a 35% chance of themselves presenting in later life. I am told. 

<br><br><br><br><br>

<blockquote>

        <i>Without some vulgarity there is no complete man.</i>
    </small>
</blockquote>
-- Raymond Chandler

<br>

He has a semblance of <i>vast</i> experience, or wisdom. Tacit uncanny models, unseen and unfelt states or events. He knows what you are made to pretend at knowing (blazered kids cracking jokes about crack). I always suspected him of having written a long novel, or some other quiet greatness. Maybe seventy portraits of the same thing. The only way.<br />
<br />

So Babes In Toyland drink with Dowland. Thou skiller, J Dillazilla, <br />
a local authority and&nbsp;a name. a spiral shorthand. <br />
The postmodern did have something to offer<br />
though it took its time in signing this up.<br />




<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __Lévi-Strauss__
<!-- 2010-02-02 -->

no pedestals for anyone - totema!

I am a neolithic man! and my science is well put.

I hear in every language a universal echo!

as universal as you get with humans, anyway.

Marx of myth, I ran rings round menhir.

You'll note patterns in your very bones if you only drop some airs.



<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __A PHILOSOPHE AMIDST POSTMODERNS__
<!-- 2010-02-02 -->



Thought ourselves clever,
etched worth on our skin
by idea alone.

There are these
very sparkling minds,
devoted to inglory.

They are the
weight of grain in diamonds
amongst worse things.

Their Work
-- Unearned if good,
Unsurprising if not --

takes regular tolls;
a taxing ignorance paid in irritation.
And the fruits of the work are interdicted.

*

In any case there's
gottabe one answer, one
spiel to spike them all!

If I'd&nbsp;been thinking
I'd've asked Body,
who is too simple to deceive.

She has air-raid sirens in her every nook;
you're invader no more
(Did the payloads expire?)

Consider Pyrrho, the mad dog
in love with what
he seemed to see.

*

I cannot reveal myself; I'm not there.
But I'll get in the gaps, e.g. between
creditor's knock and&nbsp;bailiff's ram:

I'm aiming for truth, you see,
A town twinned with&nbsp;Insane, Ohio.

What is it you rail with, right over the Reichenbachs?



<br><br><br><br><br>


#### __ADVISORY__
<!-- 2010-02-02 -->


By&nbsp;grace of angst,
For the love of ill,
throw away happiness when it comes,
get in the way of yourself;
hate,
and heartily recommend hatred;
dramatize, nostalgize;
expect too much
while disparaging hope in others;
unmake, criticize
those who bed down in
rationalised serenity;
appear eager in your reserve;
progressive while defensive;
lie whenever feasible
-- it'll slow everyone up nicely;
when&nbsp;with others, think
always how to utilise them;
objectify all things; love
only what you are certain
cannot reciprocate or benefit
from your attention.

these are seeds of good life, my child;
wheedle, snipe and smile.



<br><br><br><br><br>



#### __BESTRIDES__
<!-- 2010-02-02 -->

<blockquote>
    <small><i>I cannot intellectually justify any course of action.</i></small>
</blockquote>
-- Will the Skeptic

<br>

Aha!

That is not absolute universal ultimate truth
that's a pineapple, a trolley-car, the now-king of France,
your project.

We had lifeboats synthetic, but 
you speared the one you stood in; ours took 
your example.

The tides of doubt, the enormity,
the enormity and
your&nbsp;terror.

you&nbsp;claimed living&nbsp;a nebula of perhaps
that&nbsp;none of us&nbsp;sees is a drowning question.
your courtesy.

why doubt? because you don't want to 
know, I can't know; because none of it might matter. 
your&nbsp;great slight.

Maybe you can bend light; perhaps 
you're a figment.&nbsp;But&nbsp;something does lurk there.
I know you like one knows&nbsp;of pain.

and the sun'll come up, after all. it always does.

#### __I'll Hill Your Head__
<!-- 11/11/09 -->


Ascendent though light pollution. <br>
A canopy of youth, snug in subzero. <br>
River runneth rare; <br>
a brook of the world's <br>
bright drunkard snowmelt <br>
intermixed, tributary. <br>
A tropic of the North<br>
and movement in the undergrowth <br><br>
Descend by skyhook and bitten tongue

#### __Timepoem 1: Independence Overrated (6/10/07)__

_Being a minute-by-minute account of a shy lad with pretensions travelling to the Edinburgh University Open Day, and there enjoying a psychotic moment_

<br>

_5:19_ Lurch bleary to action <br>
My matter creaking his hello <br>
to my me and the absent sun. 

_5:22_ Crime scene vacated, <br>
prelim premortem <br>
sanguine as my smug blood. 

_5:26_ Shower, and but with all<br> 
exaggerated care <br>
make a lot of fucking noise. 

_5:40_ Breakfast remorselessly <br>
sitting in a heathen lotus <br>
Leering indictments askance.

_6:05_ Invidious from waking <br>
and rediscovering my adolescence <br>
I throw the door to percussion 

_6:10_ I'm pacified by the desert, urban, <br>
with its sunrise I don't have to share <br>
and its thrumming quasi-silence 

People walking this morning-tundra are novelties & civilities: <br>
we are collective in our solitudes, <br>
we swarm single-handed. 

I nod to each I pass <br>
which is a truly rural few we swarm 

_6:13_ Newsagent, bored, kicking his bins <br>
I'd join but there's bus to grasp

_6:20_ Dissension, tension! <br>
the awful confound and snicker <br>
of timetables misread. 

_6:24_ The bus stance putsch fails <br>
& I certainly have not rhetoric enough <br>
to force leeway. 

_6:40_. On en route en bus; <br>
I write without pause, uncertainty, <br>
point 

I would bottle this state of mind <br>
hoard it in an affective cellar for faltering times

_7:30_ The obese light rolls up the line <br>
& my spidery spread <br>
forgets even music of me.

_8:30_ Dundee, where we flit and <br>
nestle away from the chilling <br>
fact of where we've stopped.  

_8:51_ Merely overtaking default <br>
disdain, hooded discomfiture <br>
is gratuitous excitement. 

_9:52_ Edinburgh arrives at me. <br>
Too much depends on my <br>
love for a city, any port or toun. <br>
_9:54_ I hit the ice crown-first: <br>
No North; can't visualise; <br>
stomp circular and gnaw lip 

help ma boab! <br>
unquantified, unmapped and <br>
disparate dan.<br>
distress comes defcon <br>
and my face changes colour <br>
though mostly broken green. 

_10:10_ I ask, I throw upon mercies <br>
my Kingdom til I'm hoarse; <br>
Wherefore wherefore aight. 

Many shields are millstones too <br>
My silent panic is a stupidity <br>
that I cannot mask to you: 

I pulled ahead, though it was <br>
not meant to strand me or <br>
to behind you. (wrong track wrong speed) <br>
In short; why didn't I bring a map?

_10:22_ - Breathe, & try not to look so creepy <br>
"Um – sorry - but are you going to the university?" <br>
Yeahmeandmydadaretryingtofindit
