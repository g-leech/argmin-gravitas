I think you are fools to speak French<br>
It is a language which invites the mind<br>
to rebel against itself causing inflamed ideas<br>
grotesque postures and a theoritical approach<br>
to common body functions. It ordains the soul<br>
in a tacky priesthood devoted to the salvation<br>
of a failed erection. It is the language<br>
of cancer as it annexes the spirit and<br>
installs a tumour in every honeycomb<br>
Between the rotten teeth of French are incubated<br>
the pettiest notions of destiny and the shabbiest<br>
versions of glory and the dreariest dogma of change<br>
ever to pollute the simplicity of human action<br>
French is a carnival mirror in which the<br>
brachycephalic idiot is affirmed and encouraged<br>
to compose a manifesto on the destruction of the sideshow<br>
<br>
I think you are fools to speak English<br>
I know what you are thinking when you speak English<br>
You are thinking piggy English thoughts<br>
you sterilized swine of a language that has no genitals<br>
You are peepee and kaka and nothing else<br>
and therefore the lovers die in all your songs<br>
You can't fool me you cradle of urine<br>
where Jesus Christ was finally put to sleep<br>
and even the bowels of Satan cannot find<br>
a decent place to stink in your flat rhythms<br>
of ambition and disease<br>
English, I know you, you are frightened by saliva<br>
your adventure is the glass bricks of sociology<br>
you are German with a licence to kill<br>
I hate you but it is not in English<br>
I love you but it is not in French<br>
I speak to the devil but it is not about your punishment<br>
I speak to the table but it is not about your plan<br>
I kneel between the legs of the moon<br>
in a vehicle of perfect stuttering<br>
and you dare to interview me on the matter<br>
of your loathsome destinies<br>
you poor boobies of the north<br>
who have set out for heaven with your mouths on fire<br>
Surrender now surrender to each other<br>
your loveliest useless aspects<br>
and live with me in this and other voices<br>
like the wind harps you were meant to be<br>
Come and sleep in the mother tongue<br>
and be awakened by a virgin<br>
(O dead-hearted turds of particular speech)<br>
be awakened by a virgin<br>
into a sovereign state of common grace.<br>
