## Breakthroughs

The sodium-channel inhibitor suzetrigine is the first oral non-opioid painkiller approved for use in the US. It's strong, as strong as hydrocodone or low-dose morphine. It is nonaddictive!!

the LHC currently produces gold at a maximum rate of about 89 000 nuclei per second from lead–lead collisions at the ALICE collision point. Gold nuclei emerge from the collision with very high energy and hit the LHC beam pipe or collimators at various points downstream, where they immediately fragment into single protons, neutrons and other particles. The gold exists for just a tiny fraction of a second.

Claim that we have identified a bacterium that causes schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is heritable, but we have struggled to identify the genes involved, only explaining 32% of the variance with monstrously large polygenic scoring. Skolnick instead proposes that one unusual gut bacterium, Ruminococcus gnavus, is responsible through a specific amine pathway, effectively drugging you constantly over your life. MAYBE MAYBE this means it's curable. Obvious test is to see what happens (has already happened) in patients who have schizophrenia and also get full-spectrum antibiotics for other reasons.
