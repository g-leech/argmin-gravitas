This year I decided to get into dancing. I actually got into kayaking, Haskell and I theorised country music. 

This year I quit nicotine. Zyban works! For a while.

## Work

* I worked 2103 hours, not counting fun stuff like the blog.
* Started my first company, [Arb](https://twitter.com/ArbResearch/status/1604229575524978688).
* We crunched most of Asimov, Heinlein and Clarke's nonfiction to [answer a question](https://www.cold-takes.com/the-track-record-of-futurists-seems-fine/). Probably the most memey thing I will ever be paid todo.
* Proposal about developmental neuroscience and AI.
* Proposal about backfiring AI safety
* Off Road, [launch](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8ekqxkowckzEKu3uG/off-road-support-for-eas-struggling-at-uni) and [handover](https://www.rethinkwellbeing.org/).
* Emergency research teams: [writing](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sgcxDwyD2KL6BHH2C/case-for-emergency-response-teams) and executive search. 
* Ran an [ESPR](https://espr.camp/) camp for the first time.
<!-- Google Fellowship snub again -->
<!-- Deepmind intern -->
<!-- No Century Fellowship -->
<!-- Got an RA -->
* I learned Haskell tolerably ([did Euler](https://github.com/g-leech/eulered/tree/master/haskell)). `for` loops are now hopelessly ugly to me.

## Essays and sites

* [The best essay on psychosomatic disease I've ever read.](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/what-long-covid-means/) The key is compassion; he understands that _even when purely mental or "functional neurological"_, disease is real and deserves care. And yet awareness raising and the urge to medicalise seems to have massive costs.
* [I hope so much this is wrong](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-dawn-of-everything). Used to hate the author but I read this blinded and came out very impressed.

<!-- Notes on potato diet

I belatedly joined in on the mad science craze of the summer: eating only potatoes for a month, and as many potatoes as you like.

My version was pretty lax: I allowed myself oil, sweet potatoes, hot sauces, ketchup even. Also omega 3 pills and B12, potassium salt as well as sodium salt.

Still worked! Lost about 4kg in two weeks, maybe about a 1000 kcal daily deficit.

Irish epigenotype coming through

Peeling potatoes stopped indigestion. Solanine?
