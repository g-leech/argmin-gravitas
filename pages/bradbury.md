Suppose and then suppose and then suppose<br>
That wires on the far-slung telephone black poles<br>
Supped up the billion flooded words they heard<br>
Each night all night and saved the sense<br>
And meaning of it all.<br>
Then, jigsaw in the night, put all together,<br>
And in philosophic phrase<br>
Tried words like moron child,<br>
Numb-shocked electric idiot, mindless babe<br>
Alone upon its spider-threaded harpstrung poles,<br>
Incredulous of syllables that shimmer dazzle down<br>
Along swift thunder-lightning streams<br>
In sizzlings and fermentings of power.<br>
Thus mindless beast, all treasuring of vowels<br>
And consonants,<br>
Saves up a miracle of bad advice<br>
And lets it filter, seep, experiment,<br>
One hissing stutter heartbeat whisper at a time<br>
So one night soon someone in dark America<br>
Hears sharp bell ring, lifts phone<br>
And hears a voice like Holy Ghost gone far in nebulae-<br>
That Beast upon the wire,<br>
That pantomimes with lipless, tongueless mouth<br>
The epithets and slaverings of a billion unseen lovers<br>
Across continental madnesses of line in midnight sky,<br>
And with savorings and sibilance says:<br>
Hell... and then O.<br>
And then Hell-O.<br>
To such Creation-<br>
Such dumb brute wise Electric Beast,<br>
What is your wise reply?<br><br>
