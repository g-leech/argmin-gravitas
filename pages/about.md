This site is a simulacrum standing in for me. It consists of {%	include wc.html 	%} words including about 1100 <a href="{{grrr}}">book reviews</a>. I am sometimes <a href="/deaths">speaker for the dead</a>. No text computer-generated unless explicitly indicated. I specifically authorise you to plagiarise my posts.
