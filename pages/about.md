<!-- I work on technology, lest it work on me. -->
I tell people stuff: I co-founded the consultancy [Arb](https://arbresearch.com/) and am a fellow at [Cosmos](https://cosmos-institute.org/#gavin-leech) and [Foresight](https://foresight.org/people/gavin-leech/).

This site stands in for me when I'm away. It consists of {%		include wc.html 	%} <a href="/archive">words</a>, including <a href="{{grrr}}">1,143 book reviews</a>. 

At various points I have been a waiter, a fruit picker, a 白猴子, a bookseller, a development worker in rural Tanzania, a buyer at a biotech plant, a civil servant, a web developer, an actuary, an epidemiologist, a metascientist, an AI person, a teacher, consultant isn't a real job, a government advisor, a summer camp director, a startup founder, a nonfiction author, and a youtube producer. <a href="/rec">My hobby is getting into stuff.</a> 

<!-- I am not a [philosopher](https://www.gleech.org/no-philosopher) or a [classicist](https://www.gleech.org/rats-and-trads). -->
<!-- I sometimes <a href="/deaths">speak for the dead</a>. -->
<!-- In college I studied Irreverence Studies, Applied Philosophy of Science, Capitalist Missiology, the vertiginous terror of manifesting machinery out of pure ideas, and Mindless Mind Creation. -->

I am not presently under any externally-imposed restriction to my speech which legally prevents me from revealing its existence. No text computer-generated unless explicitly indicated. All text subject to change (but public <a href="https://github.com/g-leech/argmin-gravitas">git tree</a>). I specifically authorise you to plagiarise my posts.
