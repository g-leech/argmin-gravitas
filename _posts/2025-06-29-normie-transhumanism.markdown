> Society is unlikely to fall suddenly under the spell of the transhumanist worldview. But it is very possible that we will nibble at biotechnology's tempting offerings without realizing that they come at a frightful moral cost... Modifying any one of our key characteristics inevitably entails modifying a complex, interlinked package of traits, and we will never be able to anticipate the ultimate outcome... we may unwittingly invite the transhumanists to deface humanity with their genetic bulldozers and psychotropic shopping malls.

<!-- Repugnance... revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound. Indeed, in this age in which everything is held to be permissible so long as it is freely done... in which our bodies are regarded as mere instruments of our autonomous rational wills, repugnance may be the only voice left that speaks up to defend the central core of our humanity. 
- Leon Kass (2003) -->

> the great artisan... made man a creature of indeterminate nature, and... said to him 'Adam, we give you no fixed place to live, no form forever peculiar to you, no function that is yours alone. According to your desires and judgment, you will have and possess whatever place to live, whatever form, and whatever functions you yourself choose... To you is granted the power of degrading yourself into the lower forms of life, the beasts, and to you is granted the power, contained in your intellect and judgment, to be reborn into the higher forms, the divine.'... To us it was given to be whatever we choose to be, and so that is what we want.

Twenty years ago, [people](https://web.archive.org/web/20080613192720/http://www.bioethics.gov/reports/beyondtherapy/chapter1.html) [debated](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:85de7a60-20f0-490e-aa1b-9b19af5c3fa1/files/mc173c524ab0fec86a111cec10ef7e8a8) human enhancement. The "bioconservatives" predicted that biotech would lead to moral or political catastrophe, the loss of human dignity, and maybe wouldn't even boost welfare; the "transhumanists" argued that nuh uh. Some of the technologies they fought over (cloning, eugenic germline editing) didn't happen yet. But others did. Ours is an era of mass chemical enhancement:

<img src="img/Obesity-Showing-Signs-of-Decline-in-U.S.png" />

The bioconservatives predicted a reckoning for civilisation as a result. So far it didn't arrive. So either mass enhancement is just fine or the corrosive effects (on say fairness, authenticity, self-concept) are lagged or hard to measure. 

As so often, Fukuyama (above) looks wrong but is not wrong: society indeed did not become transhumanist in worldview - i.e. not in word. But it is heading there in deed. The conservative forces (religious dogma, disgust, and precaution) have in this case been grossly outgunned by the countermanding force of sheer desire. 

What we got was not exactly transhumanism, but transhumanist behaviour without the weird philosophy.


In 2010 enhancement was indeed a matter for nerds, hackers, self-medicators, and obsessive deviant hobbyists like bodybuilders.

But now it's a [much bigger](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/#4acecddb-cd6c-4154-9c82-75d8da3e1234--h-key-findings) coalition (e.g. [6% of Americans](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/#4acecddb-cd6c-4154-9c82-75d8da3e1234--h-key-findings) [on GLP agonists](https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx))

> The percentage of adults who report taking this class of medicine specifically for weight loss has increased to 12.4%, compared with 5.8% in February 2024

The social sciences mostly don't connect this to the philosophical project or project forwards. They speak more narrowly and worry. Their categories are valid and useful as far as they go ("lifestyle drugs", "Image and Performance Enhancing Drugs").


## No philosophical barrier

Natural vs artifical
	Coevolved.
	Caffeine, alcohol
Medicine vs nonmedicine
Malleability vs fixed nature
Internal vs extended

You don't need any unpopular premises at all to justify enhancement. Transhumanist practice is a direct implication of liberalism plus medicalisation.



## Medicalisation

Medicine has expanded greatly, even just / especially in the last two decades. This is true in volume (spending) and in domains (new treatments, new powers, new areas brought within the ambit). In absolute terms (multiplying [healthcare share](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-healthcare-expenditure-gdp?tab=table&tableSearch=world) by [GWP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)) we spent $1.85tn in 2000, something north of $7.1tn in 2022, and much more now.

## Demedicalisation

And then as part of the revolt of the public it was taken off the doctors.

Nootropics
Telemedicine
Research substances
rise of Chinese suppliers

## The timeline

For sanity and space let's put eugenics and genetic intervention out of scope here. So, chemical and surgical enhancement:

## Escape from Morphological Freedom

With the exception of the bodybuilders and trans communities, we don't see much weirding at mass scale. People usually use the freedom and power of biotech to look better _in normal and relatively inconspicuous_ ways. 

consumer enhancement as individual medical decision-making, distributed, private, and therefore invisible as a collective phenomenon.
