You sometimes see people say that "Abhinav [won](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Winning+his+phd) his PhD in 2019". This is a solecism for "was awarded", "earned". The gag: the only way to win is not to play.



### Ineffective

- Nothing about this looks like you would want your epistemic authorities to be picked. There is no accuracy test, calibration. Explanation.


### Perverse?

I think this is only true about 40% of the time

> many PhDs seem to teach their students actively bad methodologies and inference methods, sometimes incentivize students to commit scientific fraud, teach writing habits that are optimized to obscure and sound smart instead of aiming to explain clearly and straightforwardly, and often seem to produce zero-sum ideas around ownership of work and intellectual ideas that seem pretty bad for a research field.


> "In psychology, many do [cross-sectional] “mediation analysis”... this cannot in principle be done in any logical way... If standard data analysis in their field is illogical, that would imply the emperor has no clothes. That prestigious institutions are teaching people how to light garbage on fire"

>  you and your supervisor do not have aligned objectives with regard to project risk. For them, you are just one bet in a portfolio, and they can tolerate a project not really working out that well. For you, this is what you will be working on for the next three or four years. There are a range of other misalignments between yourself, your supervisors, and your department.

# Pain

> In hardly any other profession do neurotic problems incapacitate so many people such a large part of the time. I would guess that such mental health problems add an average of a year to the Ph.D. program, mostly in the dissertation ‘hang-up.’ Even among those who get a research degree and are recommended for scholarly promise to leading universities, a very large percentage of assistant professors fail to do enough to justify keeping them on.


## Dropout rates

Exactly 50% of my peers dropped out within 4 years. This is not an unusual rate, though it's higher than the British average, [28%](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/data-and-analysis/student-outcomes-data-dashboard/data-dashboard/). Americans are much higher ([55%](https://cgsnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phd_completion_and_attrition_analysis_of_baseline_demographic_data-2.pdf) dropped out or not complete by year 7) but this is partly to do with the insane length of them - 7 years is the median for some fields.

I don't want to milk this too hard - there's lots of great reasons to drop out of a PhD besides mental health, especially if you're in ML where the professional opportunities are so overpowered. 

<br><br>

## Mental health stats


People who think of it as a mere credential or a paid library jolly should be aware of the large quota of pain and failure in store for them. The set of people who think of doing a PhD is half people it would hurt and impoverish. (In expectation that set includes me, but by the grace of dumb luck, not this time.)


> 7% of PhD students receive medication or diagnosis for depression in a given year... PhD students still fare worse than their peers not pursuing graduate studies. Our difference-in-differences research design can attribute at least 80% of this health disadvantage to the time in the PhD program.

## Why are PhDs hard?

You're being paid to read, for years. You are surrounded by smart people who expect you to be smart. You may have maximal control over your calendar. You may have control over the nature and subject of your work. You can travel freely (if your advisor covers for you). So why is it associated with pain and illness?

Because you are repeatedly and directly confronting the boundaries of your own intelligence and finding it wanting. It's like a meditation practice consisting of slapping yourself hard in the face for years. (Actually despite the horror and pain this is good though.)

Because you care. Because of unboundedness. Because of uncertainty, open concepts, the sea. Because of stochastic reward. Because it is unlike school. Because you are alone. Because academic incentives are constantly corrupting you

- We hate phds because we hate to admit that we are bad at being free
- We hate phds because it is a simulation of hell


Thesis writing is oddly gruelling

### Challenges and Failure Modes
- 1. Always-on
- overwork and paper firehose
- self-management means self-abuse
- **Firehose**
    - ML is probably the fastest scientific field in the world. 
    - You have to go pretty lumpy ("life sciences") before the firehose of important new papers becomes of comparable rate.
    - This might actually be good, because no one is keeping up, and the inner voice screaming at you that you're falling behind calms down
- 2. Knightian uncertainty, the raft, imposture
- The good student runs out of road, has to switch to orienteering and road construction
- __Ocean__
    - Convergent metaphor, Holly Elmore
    - > There’s just something uniquely and insidiously torturous about grad school, and especially dissertation writing, and it hides behind the fact that we don’t think that kind of work should be hard.
        - > it was valuable training for me. I know how to tread water and keep my nose and mouth above the line for a *really* long time now.
- 3. Overidentification and crushingly personal failures
- Rejection of your output as rejection of your mind
- Failure to understand, failure to do the one thing you've defined yourself by
- Hypothesis: The PhD is a crisis for people who haven't fixed locus of control and overidentification with work
- 4. Loneliness
- The essential loneliness of the specialist
- Also comparing yourself to peers - who's published yet
- 5. Exploitation
- Not holding your funding
    - Economic dependency on an unstable nerd
- 6. Stochastic rewards
- Publication trauma
- mockery of your locus of control
- 7. Absentee 
- worse than being exploited is not being exploited
- not that uncommon for people to see their advisor 5 times a year
- 8. Bureaucracy
- 29 years old, taking exams
- I receive about 30 emails a week. About 1% of them are of any relevance to me. Someone at the university is paid to produce a couple a week.
- 9. No apparent impact
- you never forget your first citation
- Academics are insane, frankly wasteful about primacy and citing everything because it is how they signal respect for each other, how they prove their worth and handle bad actors, and how their jobs are decided
- I experienced only half of these (1,2,3,8) and still struggled
- 1) I had my own funding, a good amount for Europe
- 2) I didn't need to teach
- 3) I had an advisor with enough time for me
- 4) advisor was doing cool work
- 5) advisor let me pick my own projects
- 6) unusual levels of social support 
    - (daily or weekly accountability bits with coauthors and cofounders)
- 7) I had ML twitter
- 8) I lucked into two big papers in my first year 
    - (7th and 4th author, but they still helped psychologically and administratively)
- 9) European PhDs seem much easier than US PhDs
    - less competitive, less publication-obsessed, less slave-like, less teaching load, maybe less macho
- - that is, I had weirdly optimal conditions - and it was still hard.

- I scheduled an annual "Quit?" checkin 
    - [[Quit Phd (2020)]]
- It was years of fighting myself
    - [[maths trauma]]
    - There are those who will tell you never to fight yourself, since it wastes energy, since you by definition cannot win
        - and yet [[self-coercion (Gogginsism)]]
        - Nietzsche tension of spirit ("a magnificent tension of spirit... with such a tension in our bow we can now shoot at the furthest goals... we good Europeans and free, very free spirits – we still have it, the whole need of the whole tension of its bow!")
- But Guo's line is true. Some pains do not erode but temper. I went into it with the intention of becoming a great scientist. I sure didn't, but I grew in various unanticipated ways instead.
    - I used to be a pretty arrogant person, uncalibrated
    - Being painfully uncertain and confused for years at a time knocks that out of you
    - The responsibility of the generalist: to never be all that sure
    - if you're already modest and epistemically anxious, skip!!
        - if you have any depressive tendencies, consider skipping. I'm happy to help you find research opportunities less demoralising, write me.
- When I see someone has a PhD, I don't update much about their intelligence or creativity. More about their tolerance of pain, arbitrariness, and low pay. 
    - That's not nothing!


### Positional
- Is a PhD a positional good?
- Yes.

### Why is it like this?

- It's largely a profound test of patience. Which correlates with lots of epistemic virtues (nuance, scepticism, scholarship, design, depth) but is not one
- Is it secretly adaptive? What latent function does the details serve? Selection for academia
    - Incredible patience
    - Ability to stomach bureaucracies
    - Willingness to submit to arbitrary rules
- Knowledge of facts and citation chains does not in fact mean thought
- I'm revolted whenever I see someone use "Dr" as a power grab, as is common on Twitter. 
    - I'm aware of the arguments about the title fortifying unjustly ignored or disparaged groups. But to address injustice with a famously class-imbalanced marshmallow test is like 
- shitty desk space, not great home space, not great separation of work and life

<a name="rogue"></a>



I hesitate to call doing a PhD 'ambitious' - for many people it is instead vitiating and cowardly. But it is sink or swim, and that can be what you need. One way to get dunked.

https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1781021084948828259


I asked my labmates what it was all about. They didn't really know how to answer the question

<br>


- Academia is not my environment. Lots of people who say this are just not good at research or self-direction. The confusing part is that I am a sort of good researcher.
    - The research my company does is fun. I make it rigorous not to cover my ass but because I deeply want the answer to be right


## Going Rogue

- publishing covers sins
    - first workshop paper written Feb 2020, 6 months into quals year
- I had zero disciplinary warnings. This suggests that I could have gone further than I did. Worst I got was ribbing (at an event of 100 people, I was introduced as the "invisible man" of the programme). 
- One of the points of doing this is to travel freely for the last time in your life
    - 2019 - 2022: Stay in my room. Don't think about AI
    - 2022: Nassau, Prague, CDMX, Tallinn, Belgrade. Paid twice to think about AI

- Some of this was enabled by Covid disrupting the usual uni surveillance mechanisms; take care.

<br>

### Advanced Rogue: get the doctorate despite skiving

- just hang around productive people, publish a bunch, stitch it together


## Annual decision about whether to quit

## Authorship politics

## CDT

They took 9 days to acknowledge me submitting my PhD. They took three weeks to send the pdf to my examiners.

<!-- - On the face of it, there was 20% attrition. Not great, but to be expected from a new programme with students who have lots of alternative funding options.
- But this is a great underestimate. 50% is closer to the truth.
    - David quit (10%)
    - Philipp tried to quit, later AWOL (10%)
    - Stoil depressed, quit (10%)
    - Tayfun AWOL (8%)
    - I was present but almost entirely clocked off in second term (5%)
    - Dan clocked off (4%)
    - General malaise, helplessness and negativity in the others (5%)
        - Time lost to complaining, demoralisation, team failure
 -->

<!-- As so often with pretentious academics, I grew to hate my host institution. They were pretty hands-off after my 1st year, thankfully. -->
<!-- - 45% tax on graph theorist -->
<!-- - Paid themselves x thousand out of the UKRI grant -->
<!-- - Uni shambles, 5 months before they checked on my overdue APM -->
<!-- - Packing 300 kids into intro to ML, one instructor. >100k profit -->

<!-- ### CDT -->

<!-- - Takes them 10 days to update the website -->

## Against Academia in general

What does academia demand?

- Lots of time. No family helps
- No geographical ties. No family helps
- Collaborators. Very smart friends / a subaltern student pipeline
- Some intelligence
- Like reading
- Able to write
- Extreme comfort with uncertainty
- Exquisite sense of trends, PR 
- Incredible stomach for paperwork and bureaucracy

> UK academics on research-only contracts spend just over a third of their time doing research, a report has revealed... The figure is much lower for academics who teach alongside their research with just 14 per cent of their working hours being spent conducting research activities

<!-- > COWEN: Do you think of it as an __advantage__ that you don’t have a PhD?
> MEAD: __Huge__ advantage.
> COWEN: How would you describe that advantage?
> MEAD: I don’t really believe in disciplines. I see connections between things. I start from reality. I’m not trying to be anti-intellectual here. You need ideas to help you organize your perceptions of reality. But I think there’s a tendency in a lot of social science disciplines — you start from a bunch of really smart, engaged people who have been thinking about a set of questions and say, “We’ll do a lot better if we stop randomly thinking about everything that pops up and try, in some systematic way, to organize our thinking of this.”
> I think you do get some gains from that, but you see, over time, the focus of the discipline has this tendency to shift. The discipline tends to become more inward navel-gazing. “What’s the history of our efforts to systematize our thinking about this?” The discipline becomes more and more, in a sense, ideological and internally focused and less pragmatic.
> I think that some of the problem, though, is not so much in the intellectual weaknesses of a lot of conventional postgrad education, but simply almost the crime against humanity of having whole generations of smart people spend the first 30, 35 years of their lives in a total bubble, where they’re in this academic setting, and the rule . . . They become socialized into the academy, just as much as prisoners get socialized into the routines of a prison.
