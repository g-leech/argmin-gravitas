<br>

Everything you do on Spotify is public by default. You can follow other users, and their playlists, and see what they're listening to. But this isn't emphasised (you don't get any notifications about any of it), and I don't know anyone who takes much advantage of it (besides stumbling on user playlists in the course of your own missions). So if it's a social network it's the most solipsistic one. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a> <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a>

<!-- It doesn't emphasise other users at all. This obscures the fact that you can by default see anyone, and walk their graph. -->

This false privacy means there's little incentive to lie, e.g. to pretend to like cool things you don't actually like. Coupled to the fact that music is the centre of most(?) people's emotional lives, we thus get a uniquely sincere, accessible, and <a href="{{inv}}">far-reaching representation</a> of us. Peoplewatching, but for feelings.

## Some little-known scholars of popular music

I took a little walk around the user graph, looking for remarkable things. The following all impressed me with erudition or sheer determination (some of them have thousands of playlists; some have hundreds of times more playlists than followers).

I am quite serious in calling them scholars. No doubt I missed the best, the equals of any musicologist.

<br> 

* <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/ulyssestone?si=c516cb69e4e34e0e">Ulysses' Classical</a> (everything; incredibly deep dives by composer but also ECM)

* <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/hotdoorknobs?si=2e08c2bc6cf341e2">Alex naidus</a> (just a relentlessly varied procession of event and functional lists ["crying on the treadmill"])

* <a href="{{ida}}">Ida-Rose Chabon</a> (all kinds of country subgenres)
* <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1220511975?si=154976ff7eb848e2">Margeaux</a> (another simple cathedral of self)
* <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1258508389?si=de955e6707864fa3">Jonathan Evans</a> (Synaesthetics)
* <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/dnled5ui4q28w1eh0i82h2syj?si=989f0a9970eb4159">Vapor Memory</a> (skip the artist playlists and scroll down to the labels)
* <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1218340696?si=59663073cd3a43f7">Joe Schuetz</a> (hand of the king [Bangs], every angle on rock)
* <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/mofgimmers?si=8b5672e62d1b46b2">mofgimmers</a> (Taking Pills with the French, music for loud shirts, amazing single-artist lists)

* <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/gh_cl?si=b1065efe0b3a4727">ghcl</a> (lots of weird japan, musicforprogramming, obscure sounds, all manner of the world's weird)

<br>

This is not counting the paid geezers ("<a href="{{ed}}">playlist editors</a>") who publish as "Spotify". They are the central nodes, more influential than any music journalist. <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a> :

* <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/beefybanana?si=ecc99c87877c49dd">Adam P Gorman</a>
* <a href="{{g}}">Glenn</a> <a href="{{mcd}}">McDonald</a>
* I actually can't find any more but there must be dozens.



<br>

### Structuration

Even if, like many users, you don't follow anyone else, you are still affected by users - they're the ultimate source of what you are recommended. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a> This is just a legible version of [how you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization) [came to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuration_theory) and continue to change.

It is completely unsurprising that Spotify <a href="{{wave}}">often</a> <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/how-spotify-discovers-the-genres-of-tomorrow">discovers</a> and <a href="https://www.thefader.com/2020/12/02/escape-room-genre-spotify-unwrapped-explanation-every-noise-glenn-mcdonald">names</a> genres now. No one else can see what is happening and abstract away.

<br>

### The forbidden sociology of emotion

This is the richest dataset in the world about music's functions, about trends, about curation and creativity. It's like getting a partial diary for 500 million people. But it's probably not good to use it for this, given that it _feels_ private to most users. 

Still, you could use their historical data (pre-2014) to see the effect of algorithms on listening patterns and so the emotional life of a whole society. The emanations of the [echo nest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Echo_Nest).

<br>

### Self-serving paean to curators

Musical culture is now too large for anyone to even survey, let alone master - even if we window to contemporary musical culture alone, ignoring the past completely. We needed <a href="{{xgau}}">Christgau</a> (and <a href="{{scar}}">Scaruffi</a>, and <a href="{{hull}}">Hull</a> and Rockwell), to find jewels in the dross and more importantly structure in the great noise. But the job is much harder now.

Frankly we need critical service more than we need another great band. <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a> Something is lost without curation and interpretation: we can't understand. This post is me doing my bit on the third order: thinking about people who think about music.

        The Spotify editors are doing a better job than you'd expect given their employer and their incentives, but it's not enough. This is because McDonald at least is <a href="https://furia.com/">an old-school obsessive</a> with more data than any other critic in history.<br><br>
