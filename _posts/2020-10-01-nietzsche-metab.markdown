> Metabolic stress due to nutrient depletion or <b>nutrient excess</b> triggers a number of adaptive responses to restore dynamic homeostasis and to maintain cellular function.

> When there is [an] abundance of nutrients, the signal is to focus on reproduction, while when they are scarce, the cell focuses on reducing the production of, and promoting the repair of, damage.

One of the biggest ideas I've come across this year is that _metabolism is violent_. A "high metabolism" is a source of <a href="{{o}}">increased harm</a> as well as increased energy capture. What you want is not _more_ metabolic activity, but efficient metabolism, one which maintains you with as little oxidation etc as possible.

Everyone knows that too much food is bad for you; the update is to locate the harm in the body's adaptive response to the excess (its doing more work, expending scarce cellular resources and reducing repair) rather than in the consequences of mere weight gain or first-order toxic effects.

This has a sad practical implication: all but the most careful studies of diet change are heavily confounded by variation in basal metabolic rate (and so on).

The usual idea is that by restricting your diet you live longer.

The sceptical hypothesis is that you have a metabolic setpoint, which determines your diet and your longevity, and which explains most of the correlation.

You need careful experiments to check the latter. There's <a href="{{ssc}}">some evidence</a> that there is a small effect of calorie restriction (evidence mostly from nonhuman models):

> the evidence as it stands weakly supports the conclusion that [calorie restriction] modestly extends human life. We expect that an individual engaging in 20-30% CR versus a normative, non-obesogenic diet without malnutrition might enjoy a 10%-20% increase in longevity.

Interesting tangent: Nietzsche formed this hypothesis <a href="{{hammer}}">in 1888</a>, right at the beginning of the long diet fad:

> No error is more dangerous than that of confusing the cause with the effect: I call it the genuine destruction of reason.  Nevertheless, this error can be found in both the oldest and the newest habits of humanity: we even sanctify it and call it ‘religion’ and ‘morality’.  It can be found in every single claim formulated by religion and morality; priests and legislators of moral law are the authors of this destruction of reason. <br><br>
Here is an example: everyone has heard of the book in which the famous <a href="{{c}}">Cornaro</a> recommends his meagre diet as a recipe for a long and happy – and virtuous – life.  This is one of the most widely read books, and several thousand copies are still being printed in England every year.  There is no doubt in my mind that few books (except of course the Bible) have wreaked as much havoc, have shortened as many lives as this well-meaning curiosity has done.  The reason: confusion of cause and effect.  <br><br>
This conscientious Italian thought that his diet was the cause of his longevity: but the preconditions for a long life – an exceptionally slow metabolism and a minimal level of consumption – were in fact the cause of his meagre diet.  He was not free to eat either a little or a lot, his frugality was not ‘freely willed’: he got sick when he ate more.  But unless you are a carp, it is not only advisable but necessary to have decent meals.  Scholars in this day and age, with their rapid consumption of nervous energy, would be destroyed by a regimen like Cornaro’s...

<!-- Nietzsche thinks that not Cornaro’s diet but the preconditions that caused his diet—a slow metabolism and a minimal level of consumption—caused his longevity. Cornaro’s genetic makeup predisposed him to habits of the sort that would allow him to live a long life. For Nietzsche, the genes that predispose Cornaro to longevity caused his selection of a meager diet—an exact inversion of the actual causal relationship. Cornaro’s temperance arises from a environment felicitous enough to support a strong body’s development; he does not accede to a strong body because of what he eats or doesn’t. -->
<br>



He doesn't deserve too much credit, since he was happy to just assert this and not do the legwork of actually checking it, and since the reality seems to be that diet restriction is just weaker than it looks, rather than useless. But it's a nice illustration of intuitive causal inference.
