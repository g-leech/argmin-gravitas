__A bleg is Tyler's coinage for a blog post begging for some particular information.__

A very long time ago, Veblen talked about the leisure class: the people who didn't need to work. I expect this class to be larger now, simply because there's so much more slack in the economy for them.

I can unscientifically see a few types:

* Trustafarians
* Old retirees
* Young retirees (e.g. ERE)
* Entourages (personal office)
* Welfare (Geoff Dyer, Nigel Blackwell)
* Passive incomeists (landowners)
* Sinecures (tenured professors with a named chair)

Others have noted that the elite are now expected to work, and work pretty hard. I don't trust sociologists to be very curious about the details of billionaires' lives or courtiers.


# Stopgap plan: 

* Step 1. Go on Google Scholar and look for 2024 works citing Veblen (1899)
* Step 2. Look for who Ashley Mears cites.
* Step 3. Look at _Deep Utopia_ when it looks for existing reference points for post-scarcity people
