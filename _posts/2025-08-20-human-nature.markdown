This class is about human nature. That's the most complex and complicated thing I've ever tried to study.

One intuition for this is _reflexivity_: human nature includes the study of human nature, an inclination to study human nature and many existing ideologies and frameworks about it. Seems like this could be an infinite regress.


### Let's start with some sets

We are for the moment philosophers, so we can have really big variables. Let $$H$$ be the set of all properties of Humans.

What is a property in this set? (and maybe also in supersets of H)
	$$H ⊨ A$$

What are the necessary and sufficient conditions P of being a member of H?
	$$∀x : (x∈H ↔ P(x))$$

What property A is true of H and no other set?
	$$A(H)  ∧  ∀ I != H : ¬A(I)$$

## Properties of humans

## Defining properties of humans

## Unique properties

We give ourselves names. "Homo sapiens sapiens", famously.
We don't want “homo spirans”, breathing ape, for a name. Every animal breathes!*
What's unusual about us?


<div class="accordion">
	<h3>Failed claims of human uniqueness</h3>
	<div>
	Language (ok language with syntax (ok language with compositional syntax (ok language with infinitely recursive compositional syntax
)))
	<br>
	Tool use. No. Chimps use stone hammers, crows craft hooks, dolphins use sponges, octopi use coconuts as shields.
	<br>
	Culture. Orcas have dialects, chimpanzees have traditions, rats transmit food preferences
	<br>
	Art. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal-made_art 
	<br>
	Teaching / social learning - bees. orcas beach themselves to demonstrate hunting techniques to young
	<br>
	Self-recognition. Great apes, elephants, dolphins, magpies pass mirror test.
	<br>
	Emotion. Cmon. Elephants show grief, rats demonstrate empathy, dogs exhibit jealousy. 
	<br>
	Mathematics. some birds track quantities, primates show numerical competence.
	<br>
	Morality. Capuchins reject unequal pay, bats share food reciprocally, rats free trapped companions.
	<br>
	Planning. Scrub jays cache food for future needs, great apes save tools for later use.
	Imitation
	mental maps
	consciousness(!)(!)
	Higher order relations. Chimps get analogies
	Cerebral asymmetry
	Religion. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_behavior_in_animals 
	Souls, free will, Being-unto-death. How the hell would you know

	- Ant colony is passing many tests for conscious awareness.  
- cleaner wrasse fish etc. pass mirror self recognition test  
- some corvids, demonstrate autobiographical memory.  
- many animals display behaviour that may reflect an understanding of their mortality  
- parrots, monkeys, bees, all appear to possess the mathematical concept of zero  
<!-- I don't like shortest-path maze finding as evidence of anything, since gas can do this too. but making multi-objective foraging decisions--even though it lacks a brain or central nervous system   -->

Homo sapiens sapiens – “our Intelligence, duh”
1. That’s a uselessly unanalysed answer
2. Not wrong but you are underestimating nonhumans in many specific ways
3. Intelligence is tricky

Animal Olympics.
Pick any principled decomposition of intelligence.

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>Various definitive names for humans</h3>
	<div>
		Homo generalis. generalist character of human intelligence and the specialist 
	</div>
</div>


I'm comfortable admitting we are the most powerful species.

animal rationabile
animal symbolicum
the creation of signs. mental representations with abstract content
the manipulation of signs (not unique!)
the ability to use one thing or situation to stand for another
the ability to use signs about signs


“symbolic cognition”
Deflationary: “the ability to learn to use symbols”
Monologue: “Inner speech, conscious experience of internally-produced, natural language sentences”
→  autobiographical self
Mentalese: rich, combinatorial system over representations exhibiting both arbitrariness and spatio-temporal independence


Sheer number of signs and the context-free complexity
Homo insertio insertio:
recursive grammar allowing arbitrary nesting of concepts
 "The cat that the dog that the man owned chased ran away"
recursion-only hypothesis: the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language


Homo adaptabilis
Homo ubique
About 5000 on Antarctica. Not self-sufficient.
Peregrine falcon
Bacteria?
Rats made it to South Georgia thanks to us but we removed them
Highest rate of colonisation of new habitats
300ky for total global “ecological success”
Longest sustained growth of any species?
maybe
Homo Anthropocene
Human biomass = 10x wild mammal biomass
carrying capacity expansion
Control maybe 30% of primary production
Homo inanimatus
2020: anthropogenic mass > biomass


 Homo mirum
One could imagine some cross-species measure of intra-group variance in behaviour
I would guess it’s real high
← autobiographical self


Homo figmentum
Mental Time Travel
e.g. Episodic memory


capax universi
The ambitious ape
Homo sanctus / Homo sanctimonius
The divine ape
Homo economicus
Efficiency enables leisure enables learning enables efficiency
unique interweaving of evolutionarily independent abilities
crows make tools (but do not plan or teach), scrub-jays plan (but do not
teach or make tools), and cats and meerkats teach (but do not plan or make tools)
human episodic memory is more general? 
autobiographical memory → humans sense their future as extension of their past, 
metaphor gives them a sense of time 
lateralized brain allows the fine control of human hands
Combination of skills?
https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/1745691609356782


Homo culturalis
Only species with a fast second evolutionary loop (cultural evolution) allowing intra-generational shifts


Homo domesticus
Only animal to have been domesticated by itself
Only animal to have been hugely domesticated by cultural evolution


What is the measure of domestication tho? fox experiments. 
reduced reactive aggression
Big eyes
reduced sexual dimorphism
Organ size, incl. brain!
Neoteny
Noise
Gracile bones
Docility


Homo accumulans
only species that reliably retains innovations. Cumulative culture, 
Homo exponens
Homo memorans
Homo imitans
We copy each other more than other apes
But contested
Homo parentis
altriciality
Homo longaevus. 
our lifespan is unusually long for our species' mass. typically, the bigger a species is, the longer its average lifespan (e.g. domestic mice live for 1-3 years, whales can live over 200) but we're very small for how long our average lifespan is. 
big cats like tigers live around 14-15 years, brown bears 25 years, yet here we are expected to live around 75-85 years. that is NUTS.
Homo narrans
Homo decepta


Homo socialis
homo sociologicus, Homo ultrasocialis
You are a social animal
somewhat short of full eusociality
Enigma of Reason: Cognition evolved socially. So you can't think very well alone
You are not yourself when alone; you are also not yourself when in company
22% of studied mammals are solitary
Antisocial: blind mole rats become stressed and anxious when they're placed next to one another
preferences-based inferences
Homo cooperans
Children like sharing much more than chimps do
This fact is surprising from an evolutionary point of view: humans are famously unique in the degree to which we cooperate with those beyond our close genetic relatives.
Homo altrui
Alloparenting
Cross-species care
Scheler?


“Locality” 
Individual groups of humans develop their own unique ways of symbolizing and doing things - and these can be very different from the ways of other groups, even those living quite nearby.
Neoteny
Adults still play because they still need to learn


Sapiens
Homo magnocapite
The large headed ape
So is it our brains? Well it kinda has to be. But how is it our brains?: brain stuff
Then the rest of the mechanical description is, how did we come to have those brains?


Why only us?: We killed the other candidates

But what got us started on this loop, unlike everyone else? Dark-horse first cause candidate:
Homo eminus
The ranged ape. Throwing
coalitional enforcement is necessary and sufficient to allow extensive nonkin cooperation, leading to all major elements of human uniqueness. Coalitional enforcement arose uniquely in humans when the animals that founded the Homo clade acquired the ability to kill or injure conspecifics from a substantial distance
Need bipedalism first (free hands, better angles)
Homo pollicis
Best hands in the business
independent digit control, precision grip


Homo fugitivus
We are a mesaoptimiser. 
We broke some of the biological loops. Contraception

Only species who limits repro, views more as bad

Random
Homo menopausus
Homo sudans
some of the best sweaters in the animal kingdom (second only to equines) allowing us to stay cool and keep moving in hot weather. 10x the density of sweat glands compared to other great apes.
→ Homo glaber (hairlessness)


Homo geosmin 
insanely good at smelling rain (specifically geosmin), 10 parts per trillion. 
Aquatic ape hypothesis
Homo mithridatis
caffeine and chocolate are completely toxic to most animals but we can eat it without even feeling sick. even avocados are severely toxic to many animals to the point where it can be fatal to eat, but humans love it!!!
Homo cursus calcaneus
"… no animal walks or runs as we do. We keep the trunk erect; in walking, our knees are almost straight at mid-stance; the forces our feet exert on the ground are very markedly two-peaked when we walk fast; and in walking and usually in running, we strike the ground initially with the heel alone. No animal walks or runs like that
Homo persistans
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting
we are ALSO the best endurance runners ON EARTH out of ANY other species. we beat horses in endurance running. you know, the animals that gradually evolved away most of their toes in order to be the best runners?? Yeahhh.
Bipedalism is 75% more energy-efficient. Freed hands
animal laborans
Homo faber
Homo ferox
but tasmanian devils?
Homo similis
modern humans, Neanderthals, and their most recent common ancestor have displayed less genetic diversity than living great apes.
The traditional interpretation that low levels of genetic diversity in modern humans resulted from a relatively recent demographic bottleneck cannot account for similarly low levels of genetic diversity in Middle Pleistocene hominins. A more parsimonious hypothesis proposes that the effective population size of the human lineage has been low for more than 500,000 years, but the mechanism responsible for suppressing genetic diversity in Pleistocene hominin populations without similarly affecting that of their hominoid contemporaries remains unknown.
Homo pervigilans
I'm up all night to get lucky
All peoples are predominantly right-handed, and among almost all peoples the right hand is symbolic of good, the left is not
Homo ludens
Homo ridens (laughing)
Nicomachean Ethics, he wrote that humans alone are “the only living things that laugh” (Aristotle, 1954).
Homo saltans
Homo musica

Homo vestitus
Clothing Probably actually unique
Not that explanatory? Although it’s yet another reward for intelligence and fine motor control (sewing)


Homo quisibinominastult



Most of the above seem universal. We don’t need to make claims about innateness or biological encoding here.


Note that I made up most of the above binomial

Not uniquely or maximally
Patriarchy
Pair-bonding
Emotion
Spite and cruelty
concealment of ovulation
Homo monotypus
We killed or drove away the others
Hobbit Homo floresiensis
Homo turba
Dense populations by mammal standards

At the same time, invariants are very useful. All kinds of things differ across cultures; what doesn’t?

What are you? 	A person

What’s that? 		Human. H. sapiens sapiens. Class mammalia, order primate

What’s that? 		An animal

Draw three circles: animal supersets human supersets universal human

Keep a running list. Conclude by implications


You are an ape
What distinguishes this ape? 
Cancer is just you, your own body, doing what it’s always done. Cells grow and divide, and form masses of healthy tissue exploding with fresh new life. 
You can and should make claims about what works for you. Of what could work. You should be very wary of general claims.
You are opaque
You are a person
This one isn’t that analytically useful but it’s also arguably the main one
You are now 
You are a subagent
The liberal conception of self as atomic and pre-social is wrong but useful
But why is the lonely self the real one? 
Fundamentally social. Can’t survive
“You are the average of the 5 people you most recently spent time with”
Henrich – tradition as output of dangerous and slow computation
You are a historical outcome. You are caused by old things in ways which are hard to notice.
You are a citizen
until recently a subject (political); subject to, subjected to power
You are
a network node
Distributed cognition
What role do you play in your group’s cognition? In humanity’s?
Your "self" extends into your social connections

Selfishness vs. generosity; impersonal ethics vs in-groupism
Exploration vs. exploitation
Legibility (and so fairness) vs. effectiveness
Robustness vs. efficiency
Coordination vs. freedom
Pain of loneliness vs pain of hurtful others
Pain of wanting vs. emptiness of having
Truth vs. cooperation
Selection vs. diversity
Memory (grudge, trauma) vs. adaptation (forgiveness, reset)
Hedonic treadmill


Human nature has changed before and will change again
Orality and literacy

	<h3>Practical implications (applied anthropology)</h3>
	<div>
	<h4>Being an ape,</h4>
	→ you're probably more status-obsessed than you appreciate. This implies taking costly signalling seriously, working in public or otherwise gaining regular recognition. e.g. Goodreads is a status game but it's a good one. 
	→ you absolutely need to correct for ingroup favoritism
	→ probably need the colour green in your environment
	→ predictable instinct-environment mismatch. Fat and sugar scarcity. Electric light → red shift, melatonin, etc
	→ probably need physical contact
	→ probably need to exercise
	→ fission-fusion; need both solitude and togetherness
	→ low reproductive rate, long infancy
	→ neoteny
<!--  -->
	<h4>Being a machine</h4>
	Biochemistry
	→ your problems really honestly can be chemical
	formal system
	→ writing is important
	Predictive processor
	→ people see ghosts sometimes (top-down processing)
	→ Anxiety/depression as negative priors
	→ Meditation as reducing predictive processing
	→ Why surprise is both pleasurable and stressful
<!--  -->
	<h4>Being a subject</h4>
	→ your problems really honestly can be hard to model as any single chemical reaction
	Network node
	→ Social contagion
	→ Choose your network carefully - your connections determine things about you
	→ Social media as literal self-modification
	→ Loneliness as network edge disruption, not just psychological state
<!--  -->
	<h4>Being a historical outcome</h4>
	→ Things you see as inevitable probably aren’t; they can be changed
	→ Things you see as natural probably aren’t; they can be challenged
	</div>
</div>

<!-- I am in a relationship 
My relationship is in a community 
My community is in a movement 
My movement is in a country/global culture

## Do you have a purpose?

Well, whether you do or not, others want you to serve theirs:

* Your genes "want" you [them] to reproduce
* Your mum probably also wants you to reproduce, ultimately for the same reason
* Your state wants you to be productive, and now, also to reproduce
* Capitalism and Marxism want different things from you, but both also like to spread.
* ESPR would like to run next year, which is all I'll say about that

Note that all of these things die without us. In principle we could all stop recreating them at any time.


## You are unknown 

>  we give you no fixed place to live, no form that is peculiar to you, nor any function that is yours alone. According to your desires and judgment, you will have and possess whatever place to live, whatever form, and whatever functions you yourself choose. All other things have a limited and fixed nature prescribed and bounded by our laws. You, with no limit or no bound, may choose for yourself the limits and bounds of your nature. 

<center>– Mirandola</center>



## Repersonalisation

Philosophical and scientific lenses make you feel odd. This is actually, in the limit, a mental disorder called “depersonalisation”. It can be hard to feel real, natural, given. 

So let’s remind ourselves that we are also just ourselves. I find that the best way to do so -

**hands each student a water pistol**
