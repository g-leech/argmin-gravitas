_Adventure Time_ is a cartoon about the fantastical anime/D&D quests of a boy and his anthropomorphic dog. Superficially, it is joyous: filled with treasure, candy, fart jokes, dayglo idiots, new slang, and dance parties. 

But the joy in it is _post_-post-apocalyptic: the show is undermined and deepened by a dark frame - the adventures take place in a <a href="{{dying}}">ruined Earth</a>, with \~all of the adults gone. It is an unusually good depiction of nihilism, trauma, the 'meaning crisis', being neuroatypical, the contingency of self, virtue, success, love, and even existential risk.

<!-- Ooo only existed cause of apocalypse. -->

Without reading between the lines, the show is just normal Cartoon Network <a href="{{f}}">Power of Friendship</a> fare. But the real theme of the show is how to be happy in a hostile, finite, godless world. Probably only about 50 of the 280 episodes are about this, but it's the rich part.

DISCLAIMER: There are about 700 characters in the show. With this many degrees of freedom it's possible to support most weird readings by being selective.

## Glory passes

<a href="{{m}}">Manichaean</a> religion viewed the world as a finite war between light and dark - with light constantly leaking out of the world, unto eternal night. So too in _Adventure Time_: as the series goes, more and more of the heroes, gods, and stabilising forces in Ooo are removed:

* The greatest hero Billy retires, broken. Then corrupted and used by xrisk
* The king of Mars, Abe Lincoln, sacrifices himself to reverse a pointless mistake
* The god of Mars, GrobGobGlobGrod is killed.
* Prismo - an even more godlike God - is killed.*
* <a href="{{matt}}">Matthew</a>, a hive mind who claims that he will restore the world after the next apocalypse, is murdered for no particular reason.
<!-- * The Cosmic Owl is a coward and does nothing to help -->


Against this steady loss of checks and balances, villains disappear too. Because they die, or because they are aggressively humanised.

* Ice King -> heroic Simon, 
* Lich -> Sweet Pea 
* Darren
* etc


<!-- Gunther was both Orgalorg and Gunther the Apprentice. Who was from a different timeline but nvm. And who wished to become his master, except that the master loves Gunther this time. And who is thus left without the thing he loves forever -->

\* Some of this post was written before the last few seasons brought people back and generally pushed against entropy.

## Injustice

The least childish thing about the show is the repeated instances of unpunished evil and unrewarded virtue.

* Magicman, a sort of camp <a href="{{ac}}">Anton Chigurh</a>, does [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NljxtaJv-68) heinous things, including summoning a world-eating monster. He suffers somewhat, but recovers and goes on being heinous.
* Root Beer Guy, a blameless minor character given one very heartfelt episode, is brutally murdered during a siege of the Candy Kingdom. All others who die in this episode are revived, but not him.
* The terrible <a href="{{stag}}">Stag</a>, who briefly enslaves an entire country in order to devour them, is transformed into a telescope (justice I guess), but is later put back. 

<!-- ## Finn: puberty as zombification

We see Finn hit puberty, at which point he does realistically stupid and cringey things. 

His initial love interest is an enlightened fascist, like Catherine the Great. -->



<!-- ## Jake: against self-knowledge

Jake is adult, a father, but has no maturity and doesn't want any.
Party -->


## Martin: the fragility of self, the accident of virtue

Martin is Finn's estranged dad. He is introduced as a horrible rogue with no paternal feeling whatsoever. Later we realise that he was actually separated from Finn while heroically defending the boy, and got brain damage.

<!-- "And I don't think he got brain damage after he and fin ran but that he is might have ye memory loss but also a lot deep shame. And that why he acts the way he does to deal with it. Thinking "I am just a bad person so lol whatever" -->

Fans dislike the brain damage idea, since it feels to them to rob his actions of the evil and arrogance they want to ascribe him. It's true that cheap writers use brain damage as a way of getting out of plot corners. But this instance is neither cheap nor dissatisfying:

Martin the husband tried his best, was even heroic, and still ended up failing his family - and worse, ending up with them thinking he was a villain; and worse, actually having his personality altered to confirm that impression.

The point is that the self is fragile; virtue and vice are partly happy or unhappy accidents; and yes the mask can eat into the face and make you into what you do.

He was a rogue and a cheapskate before Minerva, but he is much much worse than this after the head injury.
You can retcon this as his defence mechanism from shame, but I find the neurological explanation simpler, more disturbing, and satisfying.

#### What do we know?

* We have one bit of concept art showing him after the Guardian fight with a head wound.

<img src="/img/martin.jpg" />

* He vaguely remembers Finn and sits with him in a young dad way. In my telling, this is unconscious muscle memory.

<!-- M:
Omg you Are so dark
With mine there is a silver lining , but with you it's just doom
Then fin meets him while he is taking advantage of those lil things he is so jolly
Wanting to engage with fin
Sitting with him like he did when fin was little
And he points out look how funny I'm sitting people don't sit like that
Like he deep down remembers that that how he used to be with fin
While fin doesn't get  it since he was a baby then

## Lemonhope dies last

The most startling episode in the whole series is [Lemonhope II](https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Lemonhope_Part_2). A thousand years after the events of the main series, Lemonhope wanders through an empty wasteland, passing abandoned cities and fallen landmarks. We see no other life. Then alone he dies.

The timeline it implies:

1. Our Earth 
2. Apocalypse 1, the Great Mushroom War 
3. [Shoko & Tiger](https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Shoko)
4. Finn & Jake
5. Apocalypse 2 
6. Shermy & Beth 
7. The death of Lemonhope, the last adventurer 

That is, this cartoon depicts the total death of its own world.


## Or maybe everything stays

Understandably, the finale veers away from this, instead emphasising endless cycles of death and new life. It hints that Lemonhope II isn't the final word on Ooo, that it goes on: "<a href="{{rs}}">people just keep living their lives</a>". There are more and more apocalypses, and people recover and get used to it each time. "Everything stays, but it still changes"

</center>

I don't mind this alternative; unlike the reading of Martin that paints him as _just_ a wilful liar, or _just_ the result of deeply repressed shame, the eternal adventure is at least an ethos.

## Fandom is forever

The final song, "<a href="{{time}}">Time Adventure</a>" has a lot going on. First: 4-dimensionalism about time.

> _Time is an illusion that helps things make sense<br>So we're always living in the present tense.<br>It seems unforgiving when a good thing ends<br>But you and I will always be back then._

It's common to deny that good things were good, e.g. following a breakup. Like Plato: "not real if it doesn't last forever". 
<!-- This is one of the worst ideas ever. -->
But on plausible views of time (growing block or eternalism), _the value still exists after it is over_: nothing subsequent can ever touch it. The universe's heat death (the end of this show) is bad, if it is bad, because it stops us having more value, not because it nullifies past value / meaning. I find this incredibly helpful to steer through life.

Second: "Time Adventure" has the characters directly address us, the audience.

> _If there was some amazing force outside of time<br>to take us back to where we were<br> And hang each moment up like pictures on the wall<br> Inside a billion tiny frames so that we can see it all, all, all<br>It would look like:<br>Will happen, happening happened..._

That force is you, e.g. watching favourite episodes out of sequence, e.g. writing long strange rants about headcanon. [Possibilist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictional-entities/#Poss) reference, if you like. Whatever its internal fate, Ooo is immortal already because we're outside their time. It's not gone until we're gone. It cushions the cancellation of a beloved show with a sermon on the serenity of a good philosophy of time and reference. 
<!-- I haven't seen an ending so grand and clean since _Cloud Atlas_. -->

<!-- ## Misc -->

<!-- * Adventure Time and Poor Things: the superficially joyous undermined / deepened by its black frame -->

<!-- * Ignore _Distant Lands_; it is didactic and has none of _AT_'s sharpness or animating injustice. The new characters and also the music sucks. -->

<!-- Madness is magic, magic is madness. Tired old equation of creativity and illness -->
