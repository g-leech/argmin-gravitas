<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin">I'm into books</a>. But overall I have probably learned more from essays: blogposts, magazine articles, zines, pamphlets, megathreads. I have probably read 25,000 of them, for instance. (Between 2012 and 2014 I worked in a bookshop and read all of the great aggregators of the day - Arts and Letters Daily, 3QuarksDaily, Longform.org, Kottke, MR, Hacker News).

Unfortunately, I didn't keep track of them. I've done my best to reconstruct this part of my inner life <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vr67rBaFwTnEDeUOXYZRrP4QD34150P2HHE1QsAbfMI/edit?gid=0#gid=0">here</a>.
