> what is the literary tradition out of which I'm working? the form that releases my best intelligence... The motor of the novel is story; the motor of the essay is thought... The world exists. Why re-create? I want to think about it, try to understand it. What I am is a wisdom junkie, knowing all along that wisdom is, in many ways, junk. I want a literature built entirely out of contemplation and revelation... I don't seek to narrate time but to investigate existence. Time must die.

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin">I'm into books</a>. But overall I have probably learned more from essays: blogposts, magazine articles, zines, pamphlets, megathreads. I have probably read 25,000 of them, for instance. (Between 2012 and 2014 I worked in a bookshop and read all of the great aggregators of the day - Arts and Letters Daily, 3QuarksDaily, Longform.org, Kottke, MR, Hacker News).


Estimate total words on ALDaily, 3Quarks, HN, Longreads, Kottke, and eventually I lowered my guard enough to click
the culture posts on MR, TETW

Unfortunately, I didn't keep track of them. I've done my best to reconstruct this part of my inner life <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vr67rBaFwTnEDeUOXYZRrP4QD34150P2HHE1QsAbfMI/edit?gid=0#gid=0">here</a>.
