> what is the literary tradition out of which I'm working? The form that releases my best intelligence... The motor of the novel is story; the motor of the essay is thought... The world exists. Why re-create? I want to think about it, try to understand it. What I am is a wisdom junkie, knowing all along that wisdom is, in many ways, junk. I want a literature built entirely out of contemplation and revelation... I don't seek to narrate time but to investigate existence. Time must die.

> even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists. Your mind is like a compiled program you've lost the source of. It works, but you don't know why.

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin">I like books</a>. But overall I have probably learned more from essays: magazines, blogposts, newspapers, zines, pamphlets, megathreads, shitposts, dialogues, conceptual analyses, cost-benefit analyses, certain prose poems. I have probably read 35,000 of them, for instance; ten times more than books. (Between 2012 and 2013 I worked in a quiet bookshop and read all of the great aggregators of the day - Arts and Letters Daily, 3QuarksDaily, Longform.org, Kottke, Hacker News. Easily 100,000 words a day. Eventually I lowered my suspicion of neoliberals enough to read the culture posts on [MR](https://marginalrevolution.com/) too - I studiously ignored the economics ones.)

Unfortunately, I didn't keep track of them. I've done my best to reconstruct this part of my inner life <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vr67rBaFwTnEDeUOXYZRrP4QD34150P2HHE1QsAbfMI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. I only got 1% so far. I wish I could assure you it's the top 1% but it isn't.

The [shortlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vr67rBaFwTnEDeUOXYZRrP4QD34150P2HHE1QsAbfMI/edit?gid=1979535988#gid=1979535988) consists of some that changed my life in a large and obvious and lasting way. It's probably still only 5% of those.
