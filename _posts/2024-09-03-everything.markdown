What is everything? What exists?

M
Phys
The usual answer for what everything is: nothing except 

¬E ¬P

Everything is made of particles, or fields (same thing).

RANT
	BUT horrible equivocation
	There is physics – the books, the university buildings, the bearded professors
	And physics – the quantum fields, the elusive ToE
	Map and territory

Lagrangian
	Is this physics?
	No!!!!
	Gravity
	36 Yukawa couplings!! Free parameters!!

Let’s say you had the full generator. 
But it’s chaotic and you don’t have the seed. 
It’s emergent and you don’t have the compute to simulate it all

Observable universe
Many-worlds interpretation

position-space Schrödinger equation for a single nonrelativistic particle in one dimension:


Evolutionary cosmology


Is physics all there is?
Where is the subjective in this equation?

Causal closure. Nothing causes anything except physics

Really liked describing how the standard model is incomplete and etc etc, and also that our 2424 standard model STILL can’t be physics.
Also liked that predictive power is not total due to chaos and lack of knowledge of initial conditions.

One way to know you have captured everything important is perfect prediction




Chalmers

we can imagine a world in which P ∧ ¬Q
If conceivable then possible*
So it is possible that P ∧ ¬Q


Qualia = the state of experiencing phenomena. 
	Intrinsic = nonrelational
private = no one but you
Ineffable = beyond direct verbal or physical analysis
Immediate access = they are just there

Q = at least one conscious experience in the universe

Hard Problem: Why are physical processes ever accompanied by experience?

Philosophical taxonomies

1. Analysis of pure forms: maths / logic
2. Analysis of world: sciences
3. Analysis of representations: philosophy / art
(informal forms, most thought)
4. Analysis of sensations: phenomenology / meditation / art
5. Analysis of instinct: introspection / therapy / art / unscientific psychologies

Phenomenology

Can everyone see their own nose if they try?
I’m trying to make you look at your own visual field

Notice that there is no hard edge to your visual field

Now try to go more abstract
unfocus

“Your visual field does not contain a representation of your head”
“Self-reference does not ground out in You”


Everything you will ever have awareness of, anything you will ever be “acquainted with” in the technical sense of Russell, comes through this narrow tube, the Field

Mental field = sensory field + feelings + narrative and verbal + …
