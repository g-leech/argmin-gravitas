<blockquote>Palmer’s series suggests [that] science fiction should not be viewed as just another literary genre, but as the genre where Enlightenment—the hopes for radical human self-improvement, the dream that we might collectively control our own fate as a species, the determination to transcend our own limitations — takes refuge in an anti-Utopian age that seems determined to deflate any such ambitions...<br><br> 
Its ambitions and achievements far surpass... the limited imagination of fictions that confine themselves to representing everyday life. More than philosophy or political theory, science fiction is the genre through which our age joins <a href="{{gc}}" class="nolink">the Great Conversation</a>.</blockquote>

Regarding "[Terra Ignota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Ignota)", a series of novels by Ada Palmer:

The series is a lot of things. It is the most sustained fictional portrait of <a href="{{arch}}">Archipelago</a> and <a href="{{po}}">polystates</a>, one of the few utopias I would maybe like to live in. Palmer <i>starts</i> in an Enlightenment utopia (post-war, post-nationalism, post-scarcity, post-gender, post-theocracy, post-fideism, post-meat, post-capital-punishment, post-nuclear-family, general justice via universal voluntary surveillance) and then shows what the tensions will do to any system that has to handle humans as we are.

The worldview diversity is probably the greatest thing about it. I’ve read twenty-author anthologies with less variance in values than this. Speaker’s Corner and SSC comments have nothing on Palmer. You think I'm being bien-pensant right now, praising diversity - but there are fascists in it! Sex-murder teens! The Worst Fan In The World! Rapist priestesses! All 

About half of readers find the prose unbearably clotted and affected. (If you've read books from more than two hundred years ago you'll have some immunity.) I loved the many didactic discursions - e.g. de Sade's Christian name being a plot point, the untranslated Latin - but I think most readers will not love them. You'll have to be fine with long fourth-wall violations, long passages in speculative macaronic Latin <a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9">9</a>, hallucinated C17th philosophers reacting to 25th Century scenes by expositing their extrapolated view of the 25th Century, allusions that yell 'REMEMBER ME??' in your face ('Hobbestown', the anarchist commune). I found the narrator's madness engaging but it does divert every chapter a bit. 

(Meme: “in the grim darkness of the C25th, mankind has divided into its elemental archetypes: <a href="{{h}}">jock</a>, <a href="{{ma}}">fash</a>, <a href="{{c}}">hufflepuff</a>, <a href="{{b}}">freud</a>, <a href="{{u}}">stemlord</a>, <a href="{{m}}">landlord</a>, <a href="{{black}}">libertarian</a>, <a href="{{euro}}">person with a country of origin instead of a personality</a>, and <a href="{{meh}}">'meh'</a>”. <a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7">7</a>)

The books depict superpowers, _even if we ignore the 2 or 3 purportedly supernatural beings_. The Mardis, the Censors, and the set-sets have ridiculous amounts of predictive power using Weird Data Science, predicting the timing of world events 20 or 30 years out. The Brillists have this power, plus mind reading, and bizarro mind control, and arbitrary hacking power. These are _so_ much more powerful than the tame AIs and giant mechas of the Utopians. But the plot is unchanged by them until the last book, at which point they are easily subverted for confusing reasons.

"Worldbuilding" is often a red flag. It predicts an author who cares more about their lore than their characters or plot, who is going to fail to make you _care_ that the legal system or the conlang or the magic system is consistent. Palmer is the queen of worldbuilding, _and yet she gets over it_: her characters somehow nevertheless rule the series. It is quite obvious that large amounts of her notes did not make it into the 2000 pages of this series.

Apollo Guardian of Strangers knows that it’s worth trying things again. Especially for [peace].</i>

# Book 1: _Too Like the Lightning_

I choked a little at the constant coincidences, and at the enslaved protagonist meeting literally every elite in the world in the space of two days. ("Providence" innit.)

# Book 2: _Seven Surrenders_

The sunny, war-free Hive system gets subverted multiple times. The Cousin democracy is fake. The Masons get exposed. But every Hive is governed at the whim of Madame and her captive orgy. Missed the first time: The Madame conspiracy are as bad as you'd expect, silently squeezing the pluralism and democracy out of the world

## Against Mycroft and the fans

So the surface text is deeply flawed. But it's by a Renaissance scholar, who knows all about the misattribution of deeds in favour of elites, the deep pre-emptive self-censorship, and the sheer confabulations. So we save it by noting that Mycroft and 9A are _more than half_ unreliable. The unreliable narrator is ignorable in most novels, changes some stuff around the edges to make themselves look good. Here the narrators instead misreport: the nature of reality, key figures, and the main plot.

_Excessive coincidence_. Mycroft admits to lying sometimes, but many other events are too coincidental. (Mycroft just happens upon his archnemesis Tully Mardi while he's out and about on normal business?) He's probably a more active conspirator than he lets on.

_Mary Sue elites_. Some of the ludicrously high competence of the main characters is explicitly just assigning them credit for things which were done by someone who was Damnatio'd. The elites are responsible for _most_ events here, and this isn't at all plausible.

_Inconsistencies_. See <a href="{{sixteen}}">this headfuck</a>.

The series thus simulates the experience of reading first-person Renaissance sources - while Palmer really likes her characters and makes them exceptional on purpose, (some of) the patent flaws in the text are a way to hint at their vast frame control, image management, self-deceit, and deceit.

Thus: yes, JEDD kind of sucks, 9A kind of sucks, the climactic theme kind of sucks, and the audience are allowed to notice that, despite the text <a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8">8</a>. Also yes, Gordian are probably deeply in control of the narrative and twist destiny and hobble their Utopian nemeses - and this is why they mostly escape the consequences. Madame was probably much less vicious and self-serving than we see.

This doesn't mean that the flaws are justified and doesn't fully redeem the last book. But it gives hope for those of us who would still like to like Palmer's world and who flee from the applause lights and crap Crowning Awesome trope stuff.

## TODO

* Naturalist reading which explains away Bridger and JEDD.
* Deep reading which gets through the censorship and Whig history and deification. The book without Mycroft's filters, essentially. This is how you make the Peacefall and Gordian make sense.
