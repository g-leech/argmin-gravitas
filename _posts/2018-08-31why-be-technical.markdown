Unless an author has explored his terrain thoroughly, how will he be reasonably sure that his central thesis cannot be overturned? Facts count. Tentative theorizing may have a minor role once research paths have been exhausted but, as a general principle, rumour and guesswork, those tawdry journalistic mainstays, have no place in historical writing of any kind. . . .

~(P Λ Q) -> (~P v ~Q)
~(P v Q) -> (~P Λ ~Q)"
