("Child prodigy" more recently means someone who is _very_ good at school so I don't use the term.)

<br>

It's mostly maths and music.

* Evariste Galois (Algebra), 19
* Saul Kripke (modal logic), 15
* Walter Pitts (logic, the neuron), 18
<!--* Bose (stat mech), -->
* Niels Abel (the quintic), 18
* Frank Ramsey (translation, economics), 18 
* Lagrange (variational calculus), 18 
* Gauss (geometry, number theory), 19 
* Pascal (geometry, computing), 16 
* Wiener (logic), 18
* von Neumann (foundations), 20
* Nash (games), 21
* Aaronson (complexity), 20
* Turner (painting), 15
* Picasso (painting), 15
* Dürer (painting), 13
* Gentileschi (painting), 17
<!-- Vigée Le Brun -->
<!-- Basquiat -->
* Fermi?
* Hamilton?
* Landau?
* Abelard?
* Maclaurin?

In writing, we have Rimbaud, Chatterton, Joyce, the Shelleys, Pope.

<!-- Orson Welles -->
<!--Vermeer, van Gogh, Picasso, -->
<!-- Bergman https://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/papers/base_tau.pdf -->
<!-- Colt revolver -->

In leadership, Augustus Caesar, Tokugawa Ieyasu, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, Lafayette, Genghis Khan.

I don't give a fuck about chess.

People sometimes note that no teen has ever done great work in e.g. philosophy or history. Kripke and Grotius are as close as we get.


On the other hand, it is normal for teenagers to make incredible music, such that it's unremarkable and people don't make lists. But I have:

<br>
<div class="accordion">
	<h3>Young music</h3>
	<div>
		Mozart, Mendelssohn, The Schumanns, Paganini, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Chopin, Liszt, Barber, Strauss, Rota, Nejiko Suwa.<br><br>
		Minor Threat, Replacements, Kool Herc, Behemoth, Kate Bush, Sepultura, Laura Marling, Dizzee Rascal, Arctic Monkeys, AFX, Beirut, Bad Religion, Metallica, Sondre Lerche, Green Day, Ash, Stevie Wonder, Milla Jovovich, Karen Brooks, Cap'n Jazz, Nas, James Ferraro, Yoji Mabuchi, Avey Tare, Gordon Gano, De La Soul, Them, Johnny Marr, Leiber & Mike Stoller, Fiona Apple, Maurice Williams, A Tribe Called Quest
		<!-- Horsegirl, Squirrel Bait -->
	</div>
</div>

A pattern in the above musicians is that they were _melodic or lyrical or textural_ geniuses; harmonic genius really does take time.
