> The trouble with having a Duty you cannot bring yourself to fulfill, one with flexible hours and flexible oversight, is that it leeches into every moment of your life, casting a quiet pall over the whole of it. I should do something productive, you think—but sitting right on top of the “something productive” list, absent urgent tasks with pressing deadlines, is That. There are no weekends, no evenings, no moments of contentment in knowing you have done all you need to do.

> When working on a PhD, you must focus on a topic so narrow that you can understand it completely. It will seem at first that you're working on the proverbial needle, a tiny fragment of the world, a minute crystal, beautiful but in the scheme of things, microscopic. Work with it. And the more you work with it, the more you penetrate it, the more you will come to see that your work, your subject, encompasses the world. In time, you will come to see the world in your grain of sand.

<!-- My thesis is a compulsive rebuke to specialisation.
    Is that rational? Not really but I can't help it. -->

<div class="accordion">
    <h3>tl;dr</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
<li>The whole <a href="/tags#phd">series</a> is like 10,000 words. Despite appearances it's more about my catharsis than generalisable information. So probably only read this if you are considering a PhD.</li><br><br>

<li>PhDs vary so much that no document could cover them all. So read this as the experience of 1) a CS guy, 2) in a British university, 3) during the ML boom, 4) during covid, 5) with his own funding, who 6) got lucky in first year with a big publication, with 7) a productive advisor with 8) broad interests, no god complex, and 9) not many other students and 10) who was willing to cover for me while I flailed and skived (and e.g. went to Mexico to vent).</li><br><br>

<li>They are so costly and fraught that you can assume people are not thinking very clearly about them, including me. (They don't want to have wasted 5 years; they want their hard and mildly humiliating work to be rewarded with status and deference.) <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a></li><br><br>


<li>As always, there's a huge selection effect: unhappy PhDs cannot shut up about it.</li><br><br>


<li>The cognitive demands are lower than people think and the emotional demands are remarkably high. For a common personality type, the emotional cost is too high.</li><br><br>

<li>However, you can <a href="/nograd#rogue">go rogue</a>, which greatly reduces the emotional damage. But this is only open to an uncommon personality type (the chancer, <a href="/nograd">the disloyal</a>, the agent). Alongside my PhD I started a small company, got a minor academic post, travelled the world, helped build a beautiful community, advised the UK government, and did dozens of cool side projects, some of which ended up looking like a PhD.</li><br><br>
   

<li>I went in wanting to work on AI safety. True to form, I instead ended up with a huge grab-bag: approximate Bayesian inference, Covid epidemiology, metascience, the methodology of the social sciences, inductive logic, algorithmic fairness and (of course) large language models. Some safety in there, if you squint. But I published enough, so I finished.</li><br><br>

<li><a href="/phd-numbers">Numbers</a>: It took me about 3500 hours of actual work; I read 470 papers; I published 6 first author papers on random shit.</li><br><br>

<li>I was very lucky. It looks like a success on the usual measures (h-index, impact factors, top conferences, first-author pubs, an academic job offer at the end). But I didn't go into it for poxy numbers or a mere job; I went in become a great scientist. Obviously this did not happen. But I did learn how to really read papers, how to write papers, how to present technical ideas clearly, and how to become stubborn and insensitive in the face of latent spaces. Academia is forever demystified for me. My aversion to mathematics has settled down into guarded neutrality. I am unafraid. This was probably worth it.</li><br><br>

<li>When I see someone has a PhD, I don’t update much about their intelligence or creativity. More about their tolerance for pain, arbitrariness, and low pay.</li>

## Parable

You walk into town and quickly find the saloon. As you enter, the locals fall silent and stare. One man reaches into the brazier, extracts a sizzling coal and holds it out in his bare fist, not breaking eye contact with you. Another man licks the length of a straight razor. Blood trickles from between his pursed lips.

You walk straight up to them, pull up your academic cv on your Blackberry. "PhD in computer science". The men grow pale. The coal hits the floor, the blood with it. They clear right out, not stopping for their hats and chaps. 

Some things are too awful to stunt with. What might someone who's burned years of their own life just to smell the smoke __not__ do?

This leaves this post for undiluted personal venting.


<br><br>

## Me me me

The best thing about having a PhD is that I can rant about the deep problems with PhDs.

The worst thing about it is that I can't really explain why it was painful to you without sounding absurdly cosseted - "boohoo I was paid to read for 4 years, poor me".

I don't want to milk this. I was being paid to read, paid to think, paid to talk pretty freely and fairly rigorously. This is an insane privilege. But who says privileges can't drive you mad?


<br>
<br>

### Why did I start one?

I was so thrilled to quit my job and to become a scientist, and to work on the problem of problems, AI alignment. Moreover, thanks to UKRI I wasn't going to draw scarce philanthropic funding; I would instead bring money in, begin with a neutral balance.

It was initially a top-down moralistic thing: I wanted to work on technical alignment if I could. I spent a few years wrestling <a href="{{bos}}">the Bostrom argument</a> for AI risk, unwilling to throw my life away on speculative crap and to give up my old conception of altruistic action (skin in the game, feedback loops, beneficiaries who can correct and object). Then, around 2017 it became clear to me that AI was going to be the story of the near future, x-risk or no. So I pushed myself into AI (from nearby data science) for moral reasons. This almost never works.
<!-- I get some credit for being ahead of the EA wave and the even later crypto bro / influencer invasion of the field. -->

Choosing a field (a career) is a kind of bet. In fact it's the largest bet you ever make, besides the spouse. So I get cachet for waking up (predicting how things were going to go) in 2017 rather than 2022. Though I deserve about a million times less than the 2005(!) guys.

Still, I ended up not doing an alignment PhD, instead getting a weird interdisciplinary methodology phd with ML assumptions. 
<!-- Akrasia. -->

(The self-serving story for why I worked very hard on anything except machine learning is that I am unable to compartmentalise my horror of its worst-case prospects. I feel that people should not work on it, and so I don't. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>)
<!-- I find the technology more disgusting than fascinating, though it is fascinating. -->

Another reason it was hard is that I actually just don't like working at the maths/code interface and I do maths with slight reluctance, like eating my spinach. A couple of well-meaning people tried to dissuade me from a research career as a result, but I hated them so intensely for saying it that I made them become wrong.
<!-- For a maths graduate and software engineer, I have a fairly poor relationship with maths and code. -->

<!-- for the common emotional block reasons. -->
<!-- (an earlier version of this post said "not very good at maths" which gives the wrong idea. I can do it if forced, but you have to force me – I don't take flight automatically like I do in words) -->

<br>

### Why did I finish? 

I began with no research programme and didn't really create one. So I came out with an incoherent body of work. My papers were in inductive logic, algorithmic fairness, Covid epidemiology, the metascience critique of psychological science, good ol' fashioned decision trees, probabilistic programming, fine control of language models, gaming evaluation metrics, and AI as a whole. With the collusion of more-powerful minds, I managed to glue all that into a mâché which got through.

It wasn't a sure thing. I was relentlessly disloyal to my current project, my advisor <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>, and my nominal field. If I had forced myself to be loyal I would've cracked in year 2.

Probably the median rollout finds me dropping out, having struggled along in the original area (probabilistic programming), producing very little and feeling terrible for ~18 months. In these common worlds I'd feel pretty bad about it forever and my criticisms of academia would be tempered by my worry about my sour grapes.

<!-- I just don't focus, and a PhD is the four-years-of-focus project!  -->
<!-- I am incapable of sustaining work on anything for more than about 6 weeks. -->

I made it thanks to others, in two senses: they coauthored with me on some projects and encouraged me in the others. I hate letting people down. I love coworking. Solitude is avoidable in a PhD, if you are both careful and lucky.

<!-- I had misgivings throughout. -->

I can't call myself a mediocre student because 50% of students drop out. My publications look good, but that turns out to be doable without great insight - just writing ability, smart friends, and pain tolerance. I would have probably dropped out if I didn't land the covid paper -- cynically, my PhD was over as soon as the PNAS acceptance landed. The rest was padding and PR.

I wanted to be a researcher very badly. When I got my first citation (for a <a href="/grids">blog post</a> actually) I was happy for days. I am proud of my papers and <a href="/researches">devote time</a> to them even now.

## What I got

* I became _a_ scientist, sure. I overfulfilled the goal in one sense: sheer number of domains. I published in CS, psychology, and lots in soft biology. (But "scientist" also implies focus and theories so I am instead a technical generalist.)
* I replaced my aversion to mathematical work with guarded neutrality. This will end up being worth $1m.
* I became a teacher, including a maths teacher.
* I have a much better understanding of what it is that people smarter and deeper than me do differently. I can't always follow.
* I lost all respect for academic publishing.
* I lost my respect for the median statistical model.
* I am much less defensive of my ideas, and much more able to defend them.
<!-- "deconstructing mental defensiveness through boot camp of merciless criticism" -->

- _Research taste_. The main goal. Outcome unclear: I'm good enough to do admissions for postdoc programmes like PIBBSS and peer review for PNAS and NeurIPS; I'm good enough to supervise Master's students; I have good intuitions about what won't work and what counts as evidence; I know, sadly, what kind of good work can't get published at an ML conference; I don't feel like a research lead but that's ok.
- Just knowing a lot about AI in time for its triumph. (This is pretty unavoidable for technical people since 2022 though. So the effect on me is more like: getting out of my safety bubble, knowing the conventions, knowing what good work looks like.) 
- _Confidence_. Some of this is deflationist, from seeing through academia, particularly elite journals. But also: I have steered through some latent spaces other people can't even see. I have survived a dozen struggle sessions (reviewers and journal club jousting). I am suddenly a fluent public speaker; I regularly give talks with about 30 minutes' prep and zero anxiety.
- Grit. I used to give up on things too early. I don't now. 
- Credibility. e.g. I got a international relations fellowship somehow.
- Cynicism. Holy contempt for people who use Dr in ordinary social contexts and those who require PhD in jobs. 
- Scientific writing. I could make a living off this alone, and wouldn't mind.
- Policy experience
- Clients. Two large clients implied heavily that my company wouldn't have gotten the contract if I wasn't "an academic".
- _Impact_. This should be estimatable but I balk at it at the moment. I advised the Cabinet a couple times. Lots of people talked about the Covid stuff, including the BBC. I claim my psychology <a href="/psych">stuff</a> would be helpful for most intellectuals as an emetic, for them to unlearn the bad data they have ingested.

<!-- - [[free shit with an institutional login]] -->

<!-- - Emotional control
    - Massive confidence
    - Neutrality about maths. Emotional and proportion -->
<!-- - There is almost no quality control. Novelty is barely necessary, and utility not at all -->
<!-- - Made friends with lecturers. 
    - Board games -->



- Various cheap thrills (freedom on a monthly basis, advising the gov, getting away with it, getting things to work, getting cited  <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>, feeling that I am repairable). 



<br>

### Studying during Covid

Lockdown was pretty much the best time to do a ("dry" lab) phd, maybe in history. Incredibly low opportunity cost, and piles of impact lying around for any scientist opportunistic enough.

- Bliss for the first few months. Being left alone.
- Some unbelievably great researchers all totally free to do <a href="{{remo}}">remote coworking</a> with me
- Radically altered my understanding of expertise, overton, credentials, government
- I went into my office for the last time on August 31st 2021 and finished my thesis on 20th June 2024. For most people this would be a terrible move, demotivating and unaccountable
- After lockdown I got to travel constantly all of 2022 and 2023 because the remote work setup was going well.
- AAAI and Neurips were online when I got in. Massive loss. I also missed my next chance to go in person, had to go to a wedding.

<br>

### My luck

- Very lucky to be one of Laurence's first PhD students; unlike most other advisors he had plenty of time for me. At one point (when I was struggling with the heavy numerical implementation) we did two hours a week. One of my friends got 15 minutes every _other_ week with his advisor. One spoke to her advisor once every three months, though that was her fault.

- Very lucky to be invited to work on the big Covid papers

- Very lucky to have brilliant coauthors on every single one of "my" projects. "I could not have done it without them." is usually a kind of meek and pleasant expression, but you should read this instance as a confession.

- Extremely lucky that Misha wanted to start a company, which saved my sanity

- I had my own funding, a good amount for Europe

- I didn't need to teach

- Advisor was doing cool work

- Advisor let me pick my own projects

- unusual levels of social support (daily or weekly accountability bits with coauthors and cofounders)

- I lucked into two big papers in my first year (7th and 4th author, but they still helped psychologically and administratively)

- European PhDs seem much easier than US PhDs: less competitive, less publication-obsessed, less slave-like, less teaching load, maybe less macho

- ML twitter is excellent. You get apt criticisms in 1 hour, rather than 1 year or never.


<br>


<!-- ### Misc  -->

<!--  -->

<!-- I thought about machine learning probably one day in three. This is not advice. -->

<!-- I tried a few times to start a daily labbook but failed. Bought a very fancy A4 hardback for it. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- A common pang of people who made it through school is horror at realising how little you remember, 10 years on. I got ahead of this by forgetting all about statistical learning __during__ grad school -->
<!--  -->

<!-- My phd was marred by an unusual amount of jostling for position within research teams. Covid papers were a pretty hot quantity -  -->

<!-- 1. Do you want to go into academia? Yes $\to$ PhD; No $\to$ 2. -->
<!-- 2. Will your research goals counterfactually benefit from having personal academic freedom with what to work on and/or what to say about it publicly? Yes $\to$ PhD; No $\to$ 3. -->
<!-- 3. Do you have any particular interest in some research group or working situation? Yes $\to$ pursue that; No $\to$ 4.  -->
<!-- 4. Do you prefer flexibility or money? Flexibility $\to$ do a PhD by default, learn stuff, and consider mastering/dropping out;

## Lessons

- You must form a healthy scepticism of reading. You have to <a href="{{lear}}">do</a> things

> It is possible to spend almost all of your time in literature review and seminars. It is easy to convince yourself that by doing this you are working hard and accomplishing something. The truth of the matter is that nothing will come of it unless your are an active reader and listener and unless you assign yourself time to develop your own ideas, too. It is impossible to "finish a literature review and then start research". New literature is always appearing, and as your depth and breadth increases, you will continually see new connections and related areas that must be studied.

<!-- https://www.cs.umd.edu/~oleary/gradstudy/ -->

- I shed the notion that a thesis is A Thesis, a statement, a one-off cementing of intellectual turf. That it has to mean something.

- Put an annual or twice-annual "quit?" decision point in your calendar. Take it seriously. Ask your friends to check in; they are less distorted.
- If you are already a strong scholar, strongly consider <a href="{{pub}}">PhD by publication</a>
- Afterwards, there are lots of options! The tenure track, the adjunct-hell track, the alt-ac track, the public intellectual track, the scientific consultant track, the ascended blogger track, and the <a href="{{visit}}">perma-visiting</a> track. Many of these look the same from the outside.
- You must prepare yourself for powerful cognitive distortions.
    - MOST PEOPLE DON'T PUBLISH A PAPER EVERY YEAR. look for the missing names
    - Most people don't feel that their work is very good
    - Most people are constantly feeling slightly fraudulent
- I didn't realise that most of my learning should have come from peers (fellow phds) rather than slogging alone or asking advisor.
    <!-- - I was free, to travel and skip meetings and to make playlists. But I had foregone peer learning and mutual suffering and the ego boost of helping -->
- My other big mistake was not getting the fundamentals in place. I started writing after 3 months and was distracted from the fundamentals by irrelevant mandatory classes.

<br><br>


### Experiences

I split out my warnings about grad school into <a href="/nograd">a separate post</a>. 

But I _did_ become stronger and _was_ blessed with rare and savoury experiences. Not many people get to see how science (_Science_) actually works. 
<!-- Not many people have the sheer delight of realising that the National Academy of Science means very little. -->

I got to see an editor of the Proceedings of the mighty American National Academy of Sciences feel embarrassed about how terrible a fancy academician's review of my work was:

> I realize that Referee 1's comments are non-standard, and include a number of idiosyncratic excursions that you may or may not choose to address

I got to see how governments rely on academics: surprisingly earnestly.

Ever so indirectly, I even achieved most of my initial goals (and many, many surprise goals). But this probably wasn't the most likely outcome.

            <li>Cos of the rona I actually only met my advisor in person 4 times. I know him very well - I've spent hundreds of hours with him - but it's still deeply strange to actually see him.</li><br><br>
            <li>One of the great boons of a CS PhD is that logistics and social skills are not really a bottleneck. I don't need to wait for a chemical reaction, I don't need to recruit participants, I don't really need anything except GPUs. I almost did a project with human participants -- some standard HCI experimental economics blah with language model interlocutors. I got quite far through the "IRB" (ethics board) paperwork before the sheer futility got to me.</li><br><br>
            <li>I do wonder how much less a 2024 phd means compared to a 1924 phd. Maybe just a selection effect, i.e. my cohort are not very selected. Side effect of the huge expansion in enrolment?</li><br><br>
            <li>If I had focussed and stuck to my initial priorities (and if I was better at programming) I would have produced something like my contemporary <a href="{{lind}}">David Lindner's work</a> on RL. (The funny thing is that this would have been a good result: RL looped back around to being supremely useful, through RLHF on LLMs)</li>
            <li>To conduct and publish research takes quite deep self-esteem. One big reason people drop out is they don't manage to get a positive feedback loop going from idea to execution to more ideas.</li>
            <li>Sink or swim. I did both</li>

    <div>
        <ul>
        <li>Labelled data to learn research taste (assuming they have some)</li><br>
        <li>Labelled data for motivation, strategies and metacognition</li><br>
        <li>Literally giving you ideas</li><br>
        <li>Coach. Rubberduck for getting unblocked</li><br>
        <li>Simplification, seeing through your inelegant bloated prototypes</li><br>
        <li>Analogies, remembering relevant work, narrowing the search</li><br>
        <li>General accountability</li><br>
        <li>Teaching you the field's norms and shibboleths</li><br>
        <li>Political cover against the university. miscellaneous admin and bs help</li>

    <h3>Types of research</h3>
    <div>
        I came in not really knowing what counted as meaningful research. (I did already know that "desk research", looking at other people's work, was viewed as low status.)
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Theory (supposed mathematical explanations for the success of methods)</li>
            <li>Methods (develop new methods or extend existing methods; place existing methods into a larger theoretical framework; study the properties of methods</li>
            <li>Computation (algos, speedups, maybe tailored for some data type)</li>
            <li>Datasets</li>
            <li>Applications (apply existing algo to a new domain, solving minor or major data and adaptation issues)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <!--  -->
        also the Types of Research Guy:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>ideas guy (gap spotter, conceptualiser, research taste, framing the question is more than half the task)</li>
            <li>methods guy (experimental design, statistician)</li>
            <li>code guy (optimisoor, fixer)</li>
            <li>data guy (analyst, data scientist)</li>
            <li>writeup guy (technical writer, Living library, scholar)</li>
            <li>populariser (slogans, graphics, signal boost, review, propagate, combine, critique, synergise, whatever resonates)</li>
            <li>mascot</li>
        </ul>

        I did the course without hardcore stimulants - as did most of my cohort. Tried vyvanse once, felt like I had been kicked in the chest. Modafinil's effects were entirely the wrong target. No caffeine. One nicotine lozenge a day.

        This is emotionally true but empirically spurious, because the median ML paper does nothing for the frontier and slightly distracts from productive work. The heart has its own reasons though.

    <li class="footnote" id="fn:2">
        Not doing one is also emotionally fraught, if this means you carry a chip on your shoulder for the rest of your life -- if you feel intellectually incomplete, or that you could have been a contender, or feel that others are pulling rank to dismiss your valid arguments.

        Citation joy is not only monkey-hooting or the craven mistaking of recognition for value. It just means that someone sorta read you and has tied you into the great weave. You don’t know them. You’ll never know them. But to the extent that a 10 minute skim can give knowledge, briefly they know you.
