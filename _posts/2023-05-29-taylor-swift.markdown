### You're on your own, kid


Pop music is good. Songwriting teams are good. Precision is good. Reptilian strategising is good. Working your arse off is good. People liking things is good. <a href="{{t}}">Artists making money</a> is good. Admitting you are a trash-fire human being is good. And reinventing yourself is good. <!-- Serial monogamy is good. Narcissist art is often great. Trash is good. Dancing in heels is impressive I guess. Singers who can't sing very well are good. She acknowledges her team frequently even if you lot don't. -->

So why does Taylor Swift make me feel like I have ants beneath my skin? 

I think it's because I am seeing a machine (<a href="{{c1}}">a series</a> <a href="{{c2}}">of large</a> <a href="{{c3}}">corporations</a> and 40+ ghostwriters and designers and <a href="{{law}}">lawyers</a>) represent itself as a singular human being I am to empathise with <a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14">14</a>. Then a large part of society greets this machine as if it was an artist, like a line of ducklings imprinting on a combine harvester.

Call the machine <a href="{{trademark}}">TS</a>. The interesting part is that Swift the human built TS the machine and to some extent controls it. A _self_-manufactured pop star: Swift obscures the machine, equivocates, and feeds it vast hosts of people (fans, co-writers, arrangers, choreographers, crew, squad, boyfriends, enemies, bloggers). The project is reflexive: it makes songs about its own controversies, songs which lead to more fame, fame which automatically produces more controversies.

TS presents itself as Swift. It does perform characters explicitly (e.g. <a class="noline" href="{{c}}">Cinderella</a>, <a class="noline" href="{{hark}}">Rebekah Harkness</a>), but the machine TS mostly pretends to be the woman Swift in various forms. It adapts to audience and times: innocence-coded (with a twang) for Nashville then; demisexual-coded (with FKA-sighing) for the glossies now; BPD-coded (and drawling) for the extremely online now. A <a class="noline" href="{{per}}">persecution</a> complex (and diphthongs) for everyone. <a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16">16</a> 

That's half of it; the other half is your incredible overestimation of the output. TS songs are moderately catchy, (recently) moderately perverse, but expertly ape The Current Thing (Shania Twain / Faith Hill / Kelly Clarkson / <!-- Jenny Lewis /--> Gaga / Kesha / Lana / Lorde / HAIM / Chvrches / FKA Twigs / <!--St Vincent--> Billie Eilish / whoever it is now). But TS is noticeably flatter than any of these. <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>

Why does the music's reception matter if the music doesn't matter? Well, I dislike things that pretend to be deep when they're not. Things which pretend to be personal are on tricky aesthetic ground. Entertainment is fine but not when it stands in place of art. We used to be iffy about parasocial relationships, corporate machines, being played.

I realise now that Swift _is_ a kind of artist – but the art is not music, it's marketing. Empire-building. Trend sniffing. Image <a href="{{lies}}">management</a>, customer relationship management, and hiring. She weathered <a href="{{prob}}">culture war</a> struggle sessions completely fine; people have repeatedly <a href="{{sady}}">announced</a> her demise; critics have bleated about the derivativeness and hollowness - and yet here she is. These feats require intelligence, deep cultural awareness, and cold blood. She <a href="{{fans}}">bucks</a> claims about the <a class="noline" href="{{mono1}}">death</a> of the monoculture. 

So if the music is uninteresting the phenomenon isn't. She plays the world like a fiddle. How?



<br>

<div class="accordion">
    <h3>What?</h3>
    <div>
        Art music exists and isn't the same as pop music. Attention is limited; true artistic appreciation is 1000 times more limited. TS is fine except insofar as it stands in place of art music, a switcharoo you lot are pulling on yourselves. Fake things (as opposed to fictions) struggle to attain greatness.<br><br>
        <!--  -->
        I like analysing stuff. In the course of making that plea for demarcation, I found actually interesting things about TS. (When you are faced with something with no merit, you always have the option of anthropology: stepping back and studying the fans, working out the deep things any phenomenon <i>of this size</i> will say about culture. The world in a grain of sand, in the flash of the feed.)<br><br>

After tuning, it tells us what we want to hear.)

        People often deny that the female face of a machine had creative control. Even <i>Björk</i>, one of the most distinctive musicians of the last 30 years, <a href="{{bjork}}">has had people deny</a> her contribution to her own music, particularly her production work.<br><br>

        <!--  -->
        My problems with TS have little to do with the size of Swift's contribution and more to do with it <i>optimising against me</i>, the product's aesthetics, and its absurd reception.<br><br>

        (It's <a href="{{martin}}">Martin</a> and Shellback and Antonoff's and the thirty others' <i>job</i> to fade into the background, to make the star seem larger than they are. But even with coauthorship this is still a trick and we shouldn't fall for it.<br><br>
        I think this trick explains TS' dominance over other pop stars: positioning the output as her ~sole work exploits a vulnerability in the "singer-songwriter" high culture status. The killer move is to pair that soi-disant confessional authenticity with the standard post-Britney sexy choreographed stadium hook shit. (Gaga did something similar, more credibly.) Then when TS smells an upcoming popstar it hitches wagons to them with a collab.

> Let people enjoy things

-- Proverb

<br>

It's uncomfortable to proclaim about Art vs Pop; <a href="/dreaming">10</a> years ago I was on the <a href="{{sanneh}}">other side</a>, of the <a href="{{pop}}">poptimists</a> (who said that pop can be good and worth talking about). I welcome us no longer pretending that pop music is bad music; I welcome us no longer doing violence to our own taste.

<br>

But as usual the revolutionaries ran to excess in their imperial era: poptimism was originally just the claim that pop music can be good -- but it morphed into a relativist land grab: that all pop is good. Sucked up all the critical oxygen. Pop's aims are vastly different from those of art music, and I want _some_ space for the latter. Midcult machines like TS steal this space <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>.

(Pitchfork, once a caricature of thoughtless hipster antipathy to the mainstream, made the _Red_ reissue an album of the year. Until 2017 they were able to totally ignore her, never reviewing any of it.)<br><br>

<a href="{{scar2}}">Scaruffi</a>'s radical conservatism:

> Art Music differs from Commercial Music the way a Monet painting differs from IKEA furniture. Although the border is frequently fuzzy... [we can still say that] being an art musician is a different kind of job, more similar to the job of the scientific researcher (and the old-fashioned inventor) than to the job of the popular entertainer...<br><br>The goal of an art musician is, first and foremost, to do what s/he feels is important and, secondly, to secure a place in the history of human civilization... Art music knows no stylistic boundaries: the division in classical, jazz, rock, hip hop and so forth still makes sense for commercial music (it basically identifies the sales channel) 

Macdonald, quoted above, carries a lot of baggage about the outsized importance of novels and elite cultural stewardship. But we don't need any of that to take the key point: pure pop is better than pop which is pretending to be art. (Yes, <a href="{{boss}}">some</a> <a href="{{zimm}}">art</a> music finds commercial success. But as a side effect of being itself.)

<!-- I think collaborative art usually sucks but it's not because multiple people are working on it. -->


<!-- > in 2020, Swift surprise-released Folklore and Evermore, two albums produced with the National’s Aaron Dessner that repositioned her as a serious musician, not just a pop star.

Product pivot! -->

There's an interesting overlap here with class <a href="{{bourdieu}}">theory</a>. No, honestly: the signalling game is now genre-omnivorous and you distinguish yourself by liking only the "<a href="{{cons}}">consecrated</a>" (high-status) instances of each genre. This is much more fun and varied than the old Classical hauteur, but it also clears the path for commercial machines like TS.

<br>

Let people enjoy things. And don't let people weaken art.


<br>

<div class="accordion">
    <h3>The economics of art</h3>
    <div>
        Once something costs <a href="{{a}}">$140m</a> to make, certain forms of art become impossible. You cannot take risks, aesthetic or physical. You cannot improvise. You must appeal broadly, probably too broadly to be yourself, unless your soul is already a common denominator. <a href="{{truck}}">Logistics</a>, an iron constraint on vision.
        <br><br>
        This is why I put up with bad production and sloppy musicianship: the higher the budget, the less likely I am to see any true experiment and idiosyncracy and deviance, which is what I want from art and often from entertainment too. Music is very cheap compared to other artforms (<a href="{{riri}}">barely</a> a million per hit), which is why we still see a modicum of experiment in popular songs.
        <br><br>
        I think the usual mechanism is that the execs meddle to ensure that they recoup their investment. And committee art is generally inferior because it takes us further from honesty and idiosyncracy. TS has sponsors and <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/about/newsroom/taylor-swift-the-eras-tour-presale">"partners"</a> (investors) to please <a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8">8</a>.

### the parasocial

> [Fan's] devotion to Taylor Swift runs so deep that she feels as if she can trust her like a friend. After the pop star encouraged fans to vote in the 2018 midterm elections, Ms. Smith registered. The 23-year-old’s most recent rite of passage — getting her first credit card — was also prompted by the singer.

<br>

> people on tumblr and twitter really don’t like to separate art from the artist, for example the artist Adele, or Taylor Swift. Everything has to be about the person Taylor Swift, and the kabbalistic implications of pieces of the lyrics. It’s not enough for people to like or not like her music. It’s all about Taylor Swift existing in the public eye, criticism is criticism of her person, her life... even the posts that criticise... feel painfully parasocial.

<br>

This part of the machine is really interesting. 

The romantic singer-songwriter tradition says that music is good to the extent that it honestly expresses one person's feelings. So how can it be _bad_ that TS talks about Swift's love life, and that people respond to it?

First: TS is simultaneously an optimised hit factory which tracks chart trends and creates products in response, _and_ a gossip mag analogue. The songs are more explicit about its celebrity subjects than past love / revenge songs. The result is a product to a greater degree than everything else is now a product. (You lot would go parasocial regardless of how private Swift was - but as it is it's cultivated in a way which makes me run screaming.)

Another is that melding public and private _destroys_ the private. Living in public prevents you being yourself (think of the self-censorship alone). This undermines the romantic artist story a second way <a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9">9</a>. And like you can read her <a href="{{diary}}">diary</a>.

The music is generally a play for sympathy or (even more sympathetic!) a revenge fantasy. Possibly these bids are even sincere -- one imagines it's quite therapeutic to have a million people cheering you. But the one-sidedness makes me disdain them (e.g. recall the absurd premise of "Reputation", that she is a victim and needs defenders).


Yet another strat: the pretence that TS is uncool, the victim of snobbery, mean girls, <a href="{{shake}}">haters</a>, paps, hacks, <a href="{{miso}}">misogyny</a>. (She's uncool, like you. She's bullied, like you. Being a fan of her is brave and kind.) Apparently this has an actual referent in Swift's misfit teen experience, but it becomes a grotesque pose in the light of TS' global <a href="{{obama}}">supremacy</a>. A side effect of the pretence is pre-empting essays like this. Haters are going to hate.

### authenticity

> If there was a single millisecond of spontaneity in the entire evening, I missed it. 

<center>–  <a class="noline" href="{{nyer}}">Curtis Sittenfeld</a> </center>

<br>


> By chance, I’d found myself having dinner with a former acquaintance of Swift’s who offhandedly described her as “calculating.” This is the only moment during our interview when Swift appears remotely flustered. She really, really hates the word calculating...<br><br>

<br>


> it’s a little foolish to knock Taylor Swift for basing her brand on authentic teenage experiences that she never actually had for the same reason that it’s naive to point out that William Shakespeare wasn’t an Italian teenager willing to die for love; the art is separate from the artist, and the better the artist the less likely they actually have any personal experience in what they’re arting.

<center>–  <a class="noline" href="{{arg}}">Argumate</a> </center>


<!-- the lyrics of her songs are deeply introspective and relate to the experience of what it’s like to be a 47 year old Swedish music producer living in the body of an American teenage girl. https://argumate.tumblr.com/post/174555226934/argumate-amazing-that-britney-spears-and-taylor -->



<br>

The machine is most visible in its <a href="{{analytics}}">precision</a> and <a href="{{tv}}">repetition</a> (Sittenfeld notices it in the exact reproduction, every show, of that giggle from "Shake It Off"). But James Brown was much <a href="{{dick}}">more of a dick</a> about precision, and I don't view him as a lesser artist because of it.

Authenticity is a very stupid idea in a lot of ways. It's ahistorical - e.g. much of the Italian <a href="{{ital}}">menu</a> didn't exist 100 years ago, and some are <a class="nolink" href="{{murica}}">American adaptations</a>, but the recipes are now fiercely gatekept as _the_ essence of Italian culture. It prevents innovation. It has made some great artists superstitiously avoid money (or <a href="{{cobain}}">kill themselves</a>) for fear of becoming inauthentic. But look at the dominant alternative!

(One difference between Shakespeare writing about Veronese gang kids and TS writing about high school kids is that Shakey wasn't pretending to be a Veronese gang kid. I can't improve on <a href="{{vox}}">this</a> analysis of how TS is engineered.)

The most interesting things about Swift were harder to discover: she's a sort of <a href="{{hs}}">high school dropout</a>; she started her career at 13 as a genuine social misfit; she remains a massive hustler who doesn't seem to regret her child-star path, and who outdoes any cupidinous rapper re: stacks <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a>. Her re-recording her back catalogue is simultaneously a highly original act of independence and profiteering laziness. (Throughout this piece I've had to check myself whenever I go to say that TS is <i>only</i> a scary money machine. Scary money machines do not make this much money!)

<br>

#### A microcosm of pop's appropriation

Pop as a whole is obviously larger and more hegemonic than little old TS: it ate gospel, it ate country, it ate jazz, it ate rock, it ate punk, it ate <a href="{{gamb}}">hip-hop</a>, it ate <a href="{{elec}}">various</a> weird obtuse electronic genres, it ate lo-fi. It wears their shucked skins whenever it likes.<br>

TS is just one little corner of this larger machine; TS only works at all because of pop's debasement of the "indie" category over the last 20 years. "Indie" began not as an aesthetic category but an _economic_ category, meaning "not a machine product". Admittedly, your choosing this economic niche meant you weren't very interested in being popular, and so "indie" in practice connoted a cluster of intensely personal weird rock. But "indie" now means "has guitars and vaguely depressed vocals" and is extremely prominent among corporate releases - overproduced lo-fi - pensive strumming with no thoughts. (The upside of this debasement is to make pop larger: irony, self-doubt and negativity are now options for hitmakers, and this makes the charts less monotonous.)


For all Swift's grinding and shrewdness, TS is just a splinter of the same spontaneous order that created Britney, Katy Perry, Demi Lovato, Halsey, Meghan Trainor, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez. <a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11">11</a> But they aren't out here being given a PhD in fine arts.

### Polymorphousness

> David Bowie turned marketing into the essence of his art. All great phenomena of popular music, from Elvis Presley to the Beatles, had been, first and foremost, marketing phenomena... With Bowie... art and marketing become one... Bowie was... the heir, no matter how perverted, of Andy Warhol's pop art... He [made underground transgressive art into] precisely what [it] had been designed to fight: a commodity.

Most machines stop iterating once they find a hypersuccessful selling point. TS is thus in a rare category along with Bowie and Madonna: the red queens. TS found massive success by presenting as a chaste country girl; a stadium dance-pop star running family-friendly S&M; an oversexed indie grrl; a politically-aware ally; a goth-lite-lite bedroom-recording-studio murmurer ...

Bowie pulled off a less-corporate, more-high-culture version of the TS trick 50 years ago and I love him for it - because his songs are, <i>at the very least</i>, interesting and aimed at more than pleasing me.

He is the great artist of surfaces; he changed style so often because there was nothing underneath. (He was also thoughtful enough that we should credit him with intentional rebellion against the pop/art and fake/authentic spectrums.) The difference is his quality and prescience: he managed to pre-empt glam, prog, vanilla funk, punk, AOR, new wave, and Online. He was a leading indicator, where TS is lagging. 

Madonna is a much better fit; the constant try-hard <a href="{{mad}}">iteration</a>, the artful use of superficiality, sex, and the celeb racket. The lauded versatility ultimately boiling down to a couple of flavours of pop.

Where will TS be in 20 years? Bowie's fate or Madonna's? <a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7">7</a> (Madonna also had 10 no.1 albums, but aside from a couple of eternal singles it's fading into the nostalgia noise level.)

It would not amaze me if this post ended up feeding TS in its way (bloggers <a href="{{lefsetz}}">have been</a> useful to it before). What a machine!

    <h3>what's good</h3>
    <div>
        I quite like the Martin/Swift numbers "Style", "Blank Space", "Shake it Off", "I Knew You Were Trouble". ("We Are Never" shows its emotional pulleys too nakedly for me to forgive it.)<br><br>
        Antonoff's "Dress" is a FKA knock-off, still good.<br>
        Of the solo work, "Enchanted" is perfect in its way, including the squeaking. (Carmichael just did the strings; I think nearly none of TS' arrangements are Swift).

    <h3>lyricist</h3>
    <div>
        I'm told that Swift's own self-conception and real talents lie in lyric-writing. I don't see it but will quote <a href="{{kontext}}">Kontextmaschine</a> for completeness:
        <br><br>
<!--  -->
        <blockquote>Okay, yes the vocabulary and grammatical structure is pitched at an eighth-grade reading level; her work is pitched at an eighth-grade audience. But that’s hardly to say there’s no depth to her lyrics, it’s just that a lot of it relies on semantic overloading, and particularly semantic overloading that specifically plays on her bridging of popular music genres.<br><br>
        To simplify, pop-rock lyrics tend to set a mood while country lyrics tell a story, but Taylor Swift lyrics tend to craft an atmosphere in which individual lines suggest a story or multiple stories (which listeners can fill in, according to the specifics of their own lives or daydreams), which can in turn be taken as literal or as metaphors.</blockquote>
