A [journalist](https://archive.ph/lHpud) was once asked to write a commencement speech for a college graduation. You know the kind of thing: secular sermons about staying true to yourself, working hard and working smart, work-life balance, being part of something bigger, etc.

She thought hard about the deepest truth she actually thought was a universal platitude and said: “wear sunscreen”. Life is so uncertain, people differ so much, that that’s the best she can do.

Unfortunately, a lot of people disagree with “wear sunscreen”. For instance, the notable bullshitter Huberman is “as scared of sunscreen as I am of melanoma.” More seriously, there's a Swedish researcher who seems honestly interested in the net effect of sun exposure on _mortality_ (instead of just melanoma prevalence or mortality from those melanomas), and tends to think that it's positive.

But _come on_! _Surely_ we know a lot about health already. Surely we live in a scientific society. 
Skin cancer is in fact very bad.


#### Shills

* But! someone is trying to sell you something
    * But most things people sell serve a function
        * But it's often a simulacrum function like status or peace of mind or care performance
            * But the anti-sunscreen people are also trying to sell me something, something with even higher margins

<br>

#### Uncertainty

But haven’t you seen the guy? Dermatoheliosis

But intermittent exposure hypothesis 
<!-- https://www.outsideonline.com/health/wellness/sunscreen-sun-exposure-skin-cancer-science/  -->
<!-- https://www.thecut.com/2020/09/is-sunscreen-bad-for-you.html -->

sun exposure improves nitric oxide production, which has been shown to lower blood pressure. Other studies suggest that avoiding the sun outright leads to higher risk factors of all-cause mortality. Still others have shown spending time in the sun leads to better sleep and potentially more testosterone.

Benzene carcinogen
Injuring cell makeup or DNA
Creating oxidation and damage to the skin
Interfering with skin homeostasis

Palaeopathologists: Medievals had about 75% less cancer than us.
    But that’s mostly just age surely
No evidence of strong skin-cancer selection-pressure on hominin skin melanin. Since albinism kept emerging


But skyrocketing melanoma diagnosis
    But epidemic of diagnosis. Benign melanomas


Uncontrolled variation is everywhere. Details are totally crucial. 
What kind of sunscreen? Applied how? In what quantity?
SPF 30?
UVA blocking?
No benzenes?
shot glass amount?
reapply every 2 hours?

Good evidence is rare
Sunscreen invented 1932. First proper RCT was 1999. 
    Past evidence useless anyway: <1980s sunscreen maxed out at SPF 2-15.

### EVEN SETTING ASIDE THE EPISTEMICS

Trivial inconvenience

Prevalence of sunscreen
    31%?

**Interactive: can I get a microreplication? How many of you wear sunscreen in summer?**

(In this crowd it was about 60%.)

How many of you apply a shot glass amount every 2 hours?
How many of you have checked it for benzenes?

<br>

Anyway that's the end of this segment trolling received wisdom. I am sorry to tell you I didn't reach a strong conclusion from reading all these papers. I still wear sunscreen, when I remember to. The nice Korean stuff.

<br>

The journalist ends on a good note for this camp and the rest of my talk though:

> Enjoy your body. Use it. Don’t be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own.

Humility

Consider the metabolism chart
You may be a machine but you are a profound and unknown one

Here is about 10% of the known human metabolism. It’s “just chemistry” and yet
Whenever someone says “oh just take X, it’ll fix it”, point to this chart. 

The chart doesn't even consider homeostasis 

If this was a FSA, it would already be quite hard to manage
But it’s not. It’s more like 10000 interlocking control processes sharing state
a society
Quantum effects too!

You can and should make claims about what works for you. Of what could work. You should be very wary of general claims.

It’s ok if you forget. The spoon will remind you.


FIRST, DO NOT HARM YOURSELF


Downsides of health interventions
Injury
Do not overtrain. 
1 resistance thing, 1 aerobic thing per day. For some of you that should be less. Only do more than this if you do this all the time already
But: ...a life is like iron. If you make good use of it, it wears out; if you don't, rust destroys it. So too we see men worn out by toil; but sluggishness and torpor would hurt them more. – Cato the Elder

Iatrogenesis
causation of disease, complication or other by medical (diagnosis, intervention, error, negligence)
JFK hospitalised 36 times.  autoimmune polyglandular syndrome   drugged  etc
Dense beta-amyloid plaques are protective. 
Nonemergency surgeries are often terrible EV
US: overtreatment for liability asscovering
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9397410


Activity: any iatrogenesis you want to share?



Worry
Hypochondria -> suffering 
-> overtreatment -> suffering
You might just go nuts (Seth Roberts)

Psychosomatic disease
You got into ESPR, so you’re imaginative. You applied to Healthcamp, so you’re sensitive to the topic. Risky combo
Most obvious: panic about panic attacks → panic attack → worse symptoms → panic →
Health anxiety
Eating disorder
Prevalence inflation
Manias
Half of long covid
All declarations from medical authorities about the nature of mental problems cause iatrogenic mental problems. 
That infuriating thing where the doctor shrugs and says “take two pills and call me if anything changes” is often actually what you need: 1) natural healing, regression to the mean, 2) avoid iatrogenics, 3) avoid panic, medicalisation and psychogenesis



Quality assurance catastrophes / actual poisons
Supplements can harm. often kidneys
DMAA deaths
DNP
red yeast rice, 5 deaths


Dosing. Megadoses of anything can kill you
Yohimbine death
Licorice death
Vitamin D death
Water death
Nutrient excess. Calcemia, A and E. Metabolism is violent


Interactions
St John's wort and many SSRIs
Grapefruit and overdoses
drug interactions for all supplements except protein, creatine, and vitamins

Not that likely that any of you would kill yourselves with this stuff. But you could quite easily do chronic harm


#### Sheer waste

Again, dosage is what causes effects.

* Bioavailability
* Degradation (rancidity)
* Scams / poor QA
* Ligand / salt
* Homologues
* 

Gigantic variation in actual melatonin content.

You don't want grams of the herb valerian, you want mg of valerenic acid. You don't want grams of fish oil, you want mg of long-chain unoxidised omega-3.


### Heterogeneity between subjects
One of the main reasons we can’t guide you is heterogeneity. Sometimes ESPRs produce slogans – “Agency!!”, “Respect the sheep”. If this camp comes out with one slogan, let it be “Heterogeneity!”

Some people have normal B12 serum levels and are still dying of B12 deficiency because their autoimmune disorder stops it from reaching cells in the brain

Idiosyncratic drug reactions

Paradoxical reactions
    “Caffeine makes me sleepy”
    “Ritalin is meth, but ADHD people get calm”
    One of the few hard signs of ADHD tbf 
“Antihistamine → hyperactivity”
Naltrexone blocks the opioid receptors. At low doses, painkiller
 
Chlorpromazine, major tranquilizer, may cause agitation, hallucinations, excitement, insomnia

    
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardgainer 

“Rare disease” is a broad medical term for ailments that affect less than 1 in 2000 people, with over 7000 such identified rare diseases existing and an estimated 350 million people suffering from them globally

Heterogeneity within subjects
Things often stop working. 
    Downregulation
    Boredom-placebo
            Something to do with hormones   

## The epistemic crisis: We Often Just Don’t Know 

At this camp, the default epistemic status for statements here is “works for me”. Assume it won’t work for you.

Who has heard of “evidence-based medicine”? The problem with evidence-based medicine is that there’s almost no actual evidence.

> When you are desperately doing literature review on your phone in a hospital room, you do not want your life or death decisions to be delegated to whatever med student managed to get a bad paper through peer review somewhere on their third try. 

> median doctor is just going to parrot the party line of when they went to school (20 years ago)

> you stumble onto some rando on the internet who’s making a convincing   *contrarian* argument to the effect of “actually the party line is {completely wrong, vastly overstated}, etc”

> but 80% of convincing contrarian randos are cranks, 
> so you look through their sources yourself
> but now you’ve read like eighteen different studies 
> you don’t really have the background to evaluate them, 
> but you develop the strong hunch that the only obviously correct conclusion is “dear god all these studies suck ass”
> and at that point your options are either “develop a weird relationship with a naturopath/nutritionist/guy-at-the-gym and get Into Blood Test Metrics As A Hobby” or “shrug and assume shit is probably fine.” 
> if the latter, well, damn, you coulda just skipped to the end and saved yourself some trouble!



Nutritional epidemiology was the first science I learned to dismiss outright
Associations with cancer risk or benefits have been claimed for most food ingredients


**Activity: how many of you know about the replication crisis?**


Case study: amyloid plaque clearing drugs  
    "Alzheimer's as an amyloid-started (but mostly not driven) disease. This latter point trips up some people: amyloid is the spark that sets the fire, but the fire is self-sustaining after that."



“Respectable” health influencers

Huberman (fake lab)
Sinclair (scammer)
Attia
Stanfield
Skin in the game (Johnson, Kurzweil)

Activity: how sure are you that you have no unknown allergies? Deficiencies? Chronic illness? What are you comparing to?
   Friend thought that raspberries were supposed to taste spicy
   

Activity: Who here takes Vit D supplements? 
The science is garbage
Hypercalcemia

Spinach doesn’t have much iron
Bananas don’t have much potassium
Cholesterol → anti-fat → sugary
Resveratrol dosing is insane

Activity: Who here does stretching?
Psych! Debunked in RCTs 
Double psych! Dedebunked

    Clinical experience is real. But so is delusion, ass-covering, and data fumes.
    Clinicians are also not always solving the same issue as you. Acute management vs cure.

        Antiinflammatories for muscle injury
    Ice for muscle injury
Compression

Prior is low. But silver bullets might exist for you

Empirical evidence is weak. Medical theory is no stronger than biological theory and usually much weaker. The mechanism of many old and common drugs is not really known.

benefit/cost= outcome + process / money + time + risk

We like supplements not because the numerator is high but because the denom is low



So we have to use first principles and data – and doubt them ruthlessly.

<!-- Epoché
I suggest holding off ethical questions for the next few days. 
These are important questions - farmed animals suffer greatly - but we’re here for science and cooperation rather than philosophy and debate.
It’s hard enough to think about the scientific and personal effects of diet without mixing in social desirability, identity, costs to others.

The basket
Thinking in bets
EV is a risky way to run a life but the best for individual decisions
Try 30 things for $100 each. If one works, then the whole basket probably pays off.
    Nasal strips: $0.20 a day, $70 a year. But it's worth twenty times that to me.

Bets vs science

## How to Read a Paper with a Hammer

The first step in reading a paper is to _awaken your hatred_. Do this now please: think of something which makes you genuinely angry. For me it's people who open with defect in iterated prisoner's dilemmas and people who ride short-baffle motorbikes through residential areas at 1am.

This will produce the correct posture towards a randomly chosen research article: "What the fuck did you just say? Where the fuck do you get off? Which fucking lies are these fucking liars telling me this time"

Why so mean?

Well, here's my distribution over clinical research

* 2% fraud. 
* 33% junk. (Methodological flaws mean it doesn't bear on the apparent question)
* 55% overstated
$$d < 1/2 \hat{d}$$, P(true value not in CI) = 50%

* 9% actual science, worth updating towards
* 1% kickass, actually probably got the true value and the right causal interpretation, so (modulo honest heterogeneity) it might generalise to you.

<!-- External validity -->

(Very annoyingly, this means that that infuriating thing doctors do where they ignore your pet study or new drug is actually rational.)

What makes something kickass?

* Randomisation.
* Blinding 
* Doing both intention to treat and per-protocol
* High $$n$$ (n is not itself a panacea at all - if your sampling procedure is biased, increasing the sample size will just increase the confidence in your wrong result. But I like it because a high collected n means that someone cared about this study.)
* preregistered and actually followed
* Checked adherence, e.g. visual inspection, blood levels
* properly dosed
* Active control
* maybe Within-subjects
* Bayesian model (less than I would like)
* hard endpoints
* intrinsically valuable endpoint (e.g. all-cause mortality)
* nice long followup (> 1 year)

A quick way to spot problems is the PICOT rubric

* Population
* Intervention 
* Comparator
* Outcome
* Time
* Adherence

If you stick the paper into Claude 3.5 and ask it for weaknesses by reference to the PICOT framework, it'll give you a decent quick version.

Why do we do health interventions? Because they have effects, duh!

Here are some commonly used effect metrics in clinical science:

d = mu_T - mu_C / sigma
RR = % IE / % CE
ARR = %IE - %CE
CATE = E[y_1 - y_0]
OR = IE / CE



Effect sizes are nice because they give you a smell test. If something is too small, ignore it: it's either noise or irrelevant. If something is too large, it's probably measurement error or worse.

$$d = 0.15$$: effect of statins on cholesterol
$$d = 0.25$$ average effect of SSRIs on major depression
$$d = 2$$: average difference between cis male and cis female heights

Draw the graph!

Abaluck is as good as Covid science gets. But it still falls short

We wanted P(PCR+ | masks) / P(PCR+ | ¬masks)

We got P(Ab+ | masks, , , , )
