The sister cursed under her breath, three days late to the tithe. Blink, blink, twitch canonical digits to commit. Blink, blink, digit. Blink—

(_It's now actually easier to read the logprobs right off the spike train; the blinks are just to prevent soreness, or seizure. But there's no avoiding soreness if you're as behind as she._)

She bleared on. The cleaner picked around her desk, its hum familiar, part of the morning's rhythm — normally felt through sleep. Outside, the sun painted the far wall in descending and blueshifting orange. She adjusted her phones and opened the next sample. 

She was in Polishing, refining a "nearly-finished" system. She'd take a trajectory, fix the labels or give her trace on solving it, and fire it over to a colleague somewhere. A second or two later, she'd get their suggested edits and her spikes would accept or reject them. A hundred such polisher pairs were all doing this same sub-sub-sub-task sample in the same minute — or so the SLA assured — and, once the last one crawled in, then you just aggregate or mux 'em and fire them off _and but then a millisecond later_ the system would have done its own denoising, reinforced on whatever signal survived, and already produced the next step for them (or demanded a recount), its cursor blinking like a impatient foot. 

Iterate and backtrack, bounce and vote, again and again, watching for sub-character shifts in the response, and all of reinforcing paths leading to... well, whatever it will lead to. 

The quota counter in the corner of her eye showed samples, cycles, loss, and change in loss: 5132/64025 samples, 30791/? cycles, loss ≃ 1.71, L - L0 = 0.02, ΔL = 1e-21. She had seen some samples repeated hundreds of times like a mantra. It wasn't clear why it sometimes wanted _da capo, da capo, encore, encore, encore_. It was now rare for the mechanic to come in and meddle with a too-long cycle. He had learned.

And then, after 64025 accepts? _Feasting and dancing in Jerusalem_: preference submission! Suffrage! The world whole arguing with each other and so diffusing. No task but the task of nudging the great thing that is the world in your heart's direction. 

The work consisted in patience – not analysis but reception. Let your response flow. You'd have been pruned by now if you weren't doing it right, so have a little faith. Not for the first time she thought of monks, nuns, and tulkus of old. Their careful shifts. Their sustain.

Without thinking she did another pass over the rejected sample, kicking off another flurry of thought or sub-thought elsewhere in the world, a flurry which, looping, ended again at her feet. About precision, yes. But beauty? Something out there is coming to an understanding, but not her; no kenosis for us.
