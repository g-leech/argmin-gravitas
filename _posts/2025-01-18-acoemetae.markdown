"Fuck; fuck!" the sister said, three days late to the tithe. Blink, blink, twitch canonical digits to commit. Blink, blink, digits. Blink—

(_It's now actually easier to read the logprobs right off the spike train; the blinks are just to prevent soreness, or seizure. But there's no avoiding soreness if you're as behind as she._)

She bleared on. The cleaner picked around her desk, its hum a familiar part of the morning — though normally felt through sleep. Outside, the sun painted the far wall in descending and blueshifting orange. She adjusted her phones and opened the next sample. 

She was in Polishing, refining a "nearly-finished" system. She'd take a trajectory, fix the labels or give her trace for solving it, and fire it over to a colleague somewhere. A second or two later, she'd get their suggested edits and her spikes would accept or reject them. A hundred such polisher pairs were all doing this same sub-sub-sub-task sample in the same minute — or so assured the SLA — and, once the last one crawled in, then you just aggregate or mux 'em and fire them off _and but then a millisecond later_ the system would have done its own denoising, reinforced on whatever signal survived, and already produced the next step for them (or demanded a recount), its cursor blinking like an impatient foot. 

Iterate and backtrack, bounce and vote, again and again, watching for sub-character shifts, and all of reinforcing paths leading to... well, whatever it will lead to.

The quota in the corner of her eye showed samples, cycles, loss, and change in loss: 5132/64025 samples, 30791/? cycles, loss ≃ 1.71, L - L0 = 0.02, ΔL = 1e-21. She had seen some samples repeated hundreds of times, a mantra. It wasn't clear why it sometimes wanted _da capo, da capo, encore, encore, encore_. It was rare now for the mechanic to come in and meddle with a too-long cycle. He had learned. He played with his autoencoders instead.

And then, after 64025 accepts? _Feasting and dancing in Jerusalem_: preference submission! Suffrage! The world whole arguing with each other and so diffusing to the end of the unseen maze. No task but the task of nudging the great thing that is becoming in your heart's direction. 

The work was not work but patience – not analysis, reception; flow. You'd have been pruned by now if you weren't doing it right, so have a little faith. Not for the first time she thought of monks, nuns, and tulkus of old. Their shifts, the change of days, matins, lauds, primes, terces, sexts, noneses, vespers, complines. The sustain.

Without thinking she did another pass over the rejected sample, kicking off another flurry of thought or sub-thought elsewhere, a flurry which, looping, soon ended again at her feet. Precision, yes. But beauty? 

Something is coming to understand but not her.
