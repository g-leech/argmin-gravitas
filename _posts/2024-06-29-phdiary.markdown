> There are few sources of energy so powerful as a procrastinating grad student.

<center>-- Paul Graham</center>

<br>

The following is a month by month description of what I actually did during my PhD. It's mostly for myself, an attempt to reduce the dimensionality of this odd self-assault while it's still fresh. If you're about to start, you _might_ benefit from seeing the long stretches of procrastination, incomprehension, and just how much support I needed to get through.

(It is partially censored, of course. Ask me about authorship drama some time.)

## Pre-phd Funemployment (Jun - Sep 2019)

I quit my corporate job and spent a few months reading and going to workshops. I met 84 people, 17 of which were new and deep connections, 12 of whom I later worked with.

- __Project__: none. Laying the ground. Recovering.

- __Colleagues__: none yet but I found 12 seeds which later made everything else possible.

- __Reading__: 

    - How to get a PhD: a handbook by Estelle M. Phillips

    - An Introduction to Statistical Learning by Hastie

    - Information: The New Language of Science    Hans Christian Von Baeyer

    - Computational Logic and Human Thinking: How to Be Artificially Intelligent  Robert Kowalski

    - Information Theory: A Tutorial Introduction James V. Stone

    - Becoming a Successful Scientist,    Craig Loehle

    - The Subjectivity of Scientists and the Bayesian Approach 

    - Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology   Valentino Braitenberg


In retrospect it was a mistake to not find at least one colleague and to not stick to their side, and to not have at least one research question. But even so this is one of the best ever uses of my time. I learned more during it than during any 3 month block of grad school. 

<br><br>

## Quals (Sep 2019 - Jul 2020)

My programme is an American-style "CDT", where you have a year of classes and advisor matching with no real research. We were the first cohort in a new centre, so there were some teething troubles (like the mandatory entrepreneurship course, or there not being a deep learning course).

<br>

- Sep 19: CLASSES. Back to school 

    - move cities. Claim a free lab coat I am not strictly entitled to. Start skiving patronising bureaucrat BS on day 2. 

        - a de facto MRes. Timetabled

        - There are 10 of us. 5 will drop out before the end, shrunk by the experience

    - Start using Roam in earnest

        - Actually I try lots of gimmicky "tools for thought" actually. Anki and Brainlab and various so-called nootropics. 

    - More importantly, I take up barbells for the first time in my life. 

    - GPT-2 is out but few really pay attention. Gwern sees it, poems. Transfer learning is solved, but almost no one realises this yet.

        - Everyone is talking about the need for inductive bias. Half of my programme is devoted to "knowledge-driven" methods (the doomed anti-scaling handcrafting symbolic stuff). The Bitter Lesson is yet to be tasted.

    - contrive myself a social circle ab novo. Find a few junior lecturers on Goodreads and LW and make a boardgame night with em. On one occasion I actually did a full white hat OSINT lookup on his anon profile

    - I am informed that I will be providing 100h of free labour to [KWMC]. 

    -  

    - __Colleagues__: 

    - __Reading__: 

        - Pearl PRIS (1988) (60%)

        - The Deep Learning Revolution Sejnowski (80%)

    - __Project__: none

- Oct 19: CLASSES. Get twitter. 

    - Start meeting advisors. 

    - Start doing Brauner type co-working with the man. 

    - Teach Bayesian ML (never done any before, stay about a day ahead of the students). 

        - Teacher training is so vacuous and blankfaced that I want to scream.  

    - Get on Twitter, overcoming extreme prejudice and tight-lippedness. 

        - Over the years, this single action ultimately saves me, by giving me 1000 paper summaries without triggering my aversions

    - Truly dire mandatory classes in innovation and entrepreneurship and crap. 

        - Cohort begins to revolt in week 3. HCI and IEE. 

        - Work out I can drop classes I have done the equivalent of before. Time served.

    -  

    - __Colleagues__: 

    - __Reading__: 

        - Jaynes (20%). 

        - Flach book. 

    - __Project__: Coding solidly. BERT chatbot with Kipp 

- Nov 19: CLASSES. 

    - Mind numbing linalg. 

    - I am here to do frontier research but I am only now implementing Naive Bayes for the first time.

    - Kaggle comp. Trees fall to nets. 

    - Meet softmax guy. 

    - I don't feel technical. There's a great philosopher on campus. I see if he wants to work on something with me. His views on AI make me want to scream.

    - __Q__: If I don't read textbooks now, will I ever? 

    - __Colleagues__: Nandi 

        - Tomas

    - __Reading__: Silver lectures. Nilsson.  CAIS and Kosoy.  

        - C++

    - __Project__: Skive class a week to do AISRP. 

- Dec 19. CLASSES. Study Uncertainty. 

    - Mess around with some CS lore. Bitbanging. Teach my peers the fiddly Pandas library.

    - Mandatory Public engagement, a deep indignity. 

    - Cristianini. 

    - Tralee. 

    - "It is worrying how little real thought I do in an average uni day."

    - David and Philipp start to climb the walls. This drives them to pose whiteboard puzzles and silly algo challenges. Like we should

    - Entrepreneurship course is painfully stupid, but leads me to a final break from supplements and nootropics, after 5 years of dreaming

    - __Reading__: still Pearl

        - Seven Sketches in Compositionality

    - __Project__: AISRP, neo-ILP. First actual research

        - I played with an odd alternative ML paradigm called __[inductive logic programming](http://127.0.0.1:4000/ilp)__. This led to my first paper, a negative result.

- Jan 20: 

    - Meet Laurence, who will be my advisor. He charms me by talking about Nietzsche and Boltzmann and Bourdieu

    - "Quals"

        - in American PhDs this is a terrifying oral examination

        - Shoddiness

        - Completely blanked on modal logic and have never thought about it ever again

    - Still not really reading papers.

    - Instead of studying for quals I started [listing](https://socialsciences.nature.com/posts/reversals-in-psychology) all the failed replications in psychology I’d heard of. This ballooned into a list of hundreds, and was taken up by the volunteer org [FORRT](https://forrt.org/reversals) for permanent maintenance. 

        - 4 years later, a big paper, my first-ever senior authorship.

    - Brauner bugs me to help write up his covid paper

        - a bunch of computer scientists invited me to do a little bit of writing on their big Bayesian model of what policies worked against the bug. I had no epidemiology background. 12 months later, we’d produced a series of 7 papers on important questions which weren’t being treated with the proper uncertainty.

        - Yes, this was the least neglected research topic in the world. Yes, it is strange that noobs could do this.

    - burnout

    - Get a coach, the great Daniel Kestenholz. Keep up with him once a month every month until May 2024. It is quite amazing how much just speaking out loud to a kind ear once a month achieves - so many obvious next steps which only become obvious this way. I am not sure I would have finished the PhD or been ready to run Arb without him.

    - Begin to bike [maps, Barrow Gurney via Ashton Court] to a friend in the countryside to lift. Absurdly, Covid rules mean we need to put the power rack in the garden. I may have burned out for good without the deer and the wind and the iron.

            - It's an executive act. I could never delegate before

    - Finland
