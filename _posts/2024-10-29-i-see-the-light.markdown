In my upbringing there was a deep sectarian division between the [neds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chav#:~:text=Stereotypes%20like%20Rednecks%20in%20the%20US%2C%20Bogans%20in%20Australia%2C%20Neds%20in%20Scotland%2C%20Hosers%20and%20Skeet%20in%20Canada%20and%20Newfoundland) and the [moshers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing). <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>

I was mosherlike (by default, being weird) but had some ned friends.

We would drive around the country lanes doing "circuits", aimless circles looking for someone else wanting to race. They would blast happy hardcore and trance: "dance" music. As token representative of the mosh race I would loudly grumble about it. But what else was there to do? Man does not live by Iain Banks and _Guitar Hero_ alone.

Moshers hated pop music, obviously - it was corporate and cliched and fake and saccharine. (And we hated classical for being elitist and inauthentic.)

Why dance though? Dance music often wasn't very corporate. We just called it shit because we didn't like the aesthetic and the implied "conformist" lifestyle. You had to define yourself, and the lazy or young man's method for self-definition is to negate others'.

I went on my way, snobby, righteous, and graceless. It took about 4 years for me to hear this song and for it all to click. I was alone. I was sober. I was motionless. I was pretentious. But somehow the entire scene, the umwelt unfolded and I realised my stupidity: <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>

* "Dance music" (in this Clubland / Bonkers lineage) is relentlessly positive and romantic. Both banal and transcendent. Notice that almost all of the vocals are female. It's not a stretch to think that the boys loved it, not so much lusting for the voice's subject (we didn't know what she looked like) but resonating with her passion and goals and identifying as the object of the song (love is all that I need / and I found it there in your heart. It isn't too hard to see / we're in heaven).

* So it's one of the only positive emotional outlets for rural men. (By which I mean policed men.) For some reason you didn't get judged for dancing to a fast beat, where any other such expression would be called gay at best. probably the bpm and the volume are necessary parts of the social compact here. The kick drum and the sheer pressure of noise is the masculine component that buys space for the voice and the sentiments. Country music is farm emo. Dance music is blue-collar emo.

* Obviously this all hits much harder on the right psychoactives, which I held myself above (and still do)

This is good music. It is not smart music - but most good things aren't smart.

I still can't dance.

    	Of course this was a <i>subcultural</i> division, only applying to the deviants; most people were neither - though emo hair did take over the unaligned faction '08-'13. The neds and the moshers were just those with some sort of rebellious streak - those unable or unwilling to play along.<br><br>It took me a ridiculous amount of time to realise that the neds were also deviants. I could have guessed from the slurs alone.

        I knew it as a DJ Hixxy track, and indeed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdbeZEqtRvo">official video</a> still has him as the title artist - despite the description text declaiming him as as an IP thief. The song is by the northern hardcore group Paradise and remixed into greatness by the Aldershot massive, the Quosh Records guys.
