What does a phd cost you?

People are unwilling to tell you - partly because the variance really is large (e.g. a history PhD will involve a full order of magnitude more solitary reading than a CS phd, e.g. some people lose an effective year of work and inner life to an environmental form of actual depression). And partly because it's so hard to nail down the size of the intangibles (counterfactual intellectual development, mental health). With the usual caveats that I am not you and 2024 is not 2019 and my field and department are not your field and department:

## Time

It's supposed to take ~9000 hours. You can do it in 3k. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a> Or I could. <a href="{{squigtime}}">Three MCMC estimates of the amount of time I spent</a>:

<br>

#### 1. Roughly-phd-associated hours: 3260 hours 

<center>
    <img width="60%" src="/img/phd/year_hours.jpg" />
</center>

This is pretty rough, inferred from my mood tracker and, later (from 2022 on), actually counted on my hours tracker at Arb.

This is above baseline, where the baseline is the pretty intense infovore habit I conduct at all times unprompted, c. 7 hours a day.

<br>

#### 2. Sum of hours spent on actual discrete research projects: 2060 hours

    <img width="60%" src="/img/phd/project_hours.png" />

#### 3. Hours spent on various activities (reading, writing, coding, teaching, etc)

    <img width="60%" src="/img/phd/type_hours.png" />
</center>

<br>

My best guess, triangulating between these, is 3100 hours. 1.9 hours a day, 2.6 per weekday, or 3.1 per weekday not including my sabbatical.

A small number of other people I've met have managed in much less (around 3 months wall clock) by having a lot of ideas ready to go and going ruthlessly for a PhD-by-publication.

### Wall clock

46 months
    - not counting the 8 or 10 month sabbatical
    - Where does the time go?
        - I didn't really keep a lab book like you're supposed to (I didn't really work hard enough to merit one. But I have a diary)
        - This is mostly for myself, an attempt to reduce the dimensionality of this terrible, wonderful thing while it is still fresh. But if you're about to start you might benefit from seeing the long stretches of procrastination, incomprehension, and just how much support I needed to get through
        - It is partially censored



- ### more Numbers
    - Project failure rate (no public output): 
        - Project failure rate (no peer-reviewed output): 
        - Project failure rate (no results): 
    - Publications
        - Acceptance rate: ((6/16 * 100%
    - [x00 hours](((K-K4Ki2lX)))
    - network
    - N coauthors
    - completed n textbooks (all exercises)
    - $100k funding, among the highest in the country
    - number of difficult books: 
- Opportunity cost
    - I was working in London tech. I couldn't have continued because I was bored out, but if I had found something roughly as remunerative my earnings would have been around Â£((  (65000*1.15^1 + 65000*1.15^2 + 65000*1.15^3 + 65000*1.15^4) )), so I lost about $300k on previous trajectory, much more on the trajectory that Arb and the mask paper put me on
    - Not counting Arb though
- $0000 dollars of compute 
    - 8000 of Microsoft donated for one paper, say 50000 MCMC runs
    - Very hard to say what my share of the ACRC was, but basically very little
    - Spent a grand building a nicer desktop, but didn't really make much difference besides selling me on WSL



    - I asked my labmates what it was all about. They didn't really know how to answer the question


## Benefit
- [[PhD by numbers]]
- Confidence / Credibility
- Grit
- Scientific writing
- Government experience
- Clients
- Impact
- [[research taste]]
- [[what does a research advisor do?]]
- [[free shit with an institutional login]]


## Humans

Once I almost did a project with human participants -- some standard HCI experimental economics blah.



## Time

My reviewer advised that I budget 6 months for writing up the papers into a coherent thesis. My friend did his in 7 days (90 hours). I compromised and did it 227h. 




- # Cost
    - ## {{[[calc]]: ((150+30+250+60+700))}} hours
    - This is obviously hugely less than most people or the clock time.
    - Opportunity cost
        - $400k opportunity cost
        - Impact opportunity cost
            - probably not that much
    - Quals year: extraordinary pain and tedium
    - One breakdown
    - One friend
    - Artificial isolation. Covid somewhat to blame but not much
- ## Inputs
    - X textbooks
    - Y papers
    - Knowing Jan Brauner
- ## benefits
    - Emotional control
        - Massive confidence
        - Neutrality about maths. Emotional and proportion
    - Skill
        - Paper writing
    - Cynicism
        - Holy and credible contempt for people who use Dr in ordinary social contexts, those who require them in jobs. 
            - There is almost no quality control. Novelty is barely necessary, and utility not at all
    - Made friends with lecturers. 
        - Board games
    - Cred
        - Two clients
        - Government policy
- x years, y days
    - z hours
- xxxxx words, y pages
- 11 studies 
- 97 regressions
- 0 p-values 
- xx appendices
- xxx references
