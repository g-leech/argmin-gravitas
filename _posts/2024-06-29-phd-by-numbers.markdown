## What does a phd cost you?

- [[PhD by numbers]]


### Time
- supposed to be 8000-10000 hours. You can do it in 3k
    - 500 quals
        - UM
        - MLP
        - Group 
        - IEE
        - ADS
        - NLP (Dialogue)
        - Respon
        - Clogic
        - Adv top
    - 1700 coding, writing papers, rebuttals
        - Response doc for the masks paper was 42 pages
    - [32 + 62 + post April 21st 2024] hours writing thesis
    - 500 hours meetings, advisor
    - 500 hours reading

- 46 months
    - not counting the 10 month sabbatical
    - Where does the time go?
        - I didn't really keep a lab book like you're supposed to (I didn't really work hard enough to merit one. But I have a diary)
        - This is mostly for myself, an attempt to reduce the dimensionality of this terrible, wonderful thing while it is still fresh. But if you're about to start you might benefit from seeing the long stretches of procrastination, incomprehension, and just how much support I needed to get through
        - It is partially censored



- ### more Numbers
    - Project failure rate (no public output): 
        - Project failure rate (no peer-reviewed output): 
        - Project failure rate (no results): 
    - Publications
        - Acceptance rate: ((6/16 * 100%
    - [x00 hours](((K-K4Ki2lX)))
    - network
    - N coauthors
    - completed n textbooks (all exercises)
    - $100k funding, among the highest in the country
    - number of difficult books: 
- Opportunity cost
    - I was working in London tech. I couldn't have continued because I was bored out, but if I had found something roughly as remunerative my earnings would have been around Â£((  (65000*1.15^1 + 65000*1.15^2 + 65000*1.15^3 + 65000*1.15^4) )), so I lost about $300k
    - Not counting Arb though
- $0000 dollars of compute 
    - 8000 of Microsoft donated for one paper, say 50000 MCMC runs
    - Very hard to say what my share of the ACRC was, but basically very little
    - Spent a grand building a nicer desktop, but didn't really make much difference besides selling me on WSL



    - I asked my labmates what it was all about. They didn't really know how to answer the question


## Benefit

## Humans

I almost did a experiment with humans, standard HCI experimental economics blah



## Time

My reviewer advised that I budget 6 months for write up time. My friend did his in 7 days.
