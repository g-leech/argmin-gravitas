What does a phd cost you?

People are unwilling to tell you - partly because the variance really is large (e.g. a history PhD will involve a full order of magnitude more solitary reading than a CS phd)



<br><br>

### Time

- supposed to be 8000-10000 hours. You can do it in 3k. Or I could:

    - 500 quals
        UM, MLP, Group, IEE, ADS, Dialogue, Respon, Clogic, Adv top
    - 1200 coding, writing papers
        - 150 ilp
        - 100 Science
        - 80 Neurips
        - 30 Multiresp
        - 250 TPP
        - 60 neurips
        - 700 masks

    - 300 hours rebuttals
        Response doc for the masks paper was 42 pages
    - 126 hours writing thesis
    - 270 hours lab meetings, journal clubs, preparing for presentations 
    - 211 hours advisor meetings
    - 500 hours reading

Others managed in much less.

- 46 months
    - not counting the 10 month sabbatical
    - Where does the time go?
        - I didn't really keep a lab book like you're supposed to (I didn't really work hard enough to merit one. But I have a diary)
        - This is mostly for myself, an attempt to reduce the dimensionality of this terrible, wonderful thing while it is still fresh. But if you're about to start you might benefit from seeing the long stretches of procrastination, incomprehension, and just how much support I needed to get through
        - It is partially censored



- ### more Numbers
    - Project failure rate (no public output): 
        - Project failure rate (no peer-reviewed output): 
        - Project failure rate (no results): 
    - Publications
        - Acceptance rate: ((6/16 * 100%
    - [x00 hours](((K-K4Ki2lX)))
    - network
    - N coauthors
    - completed n textbooks (all exercises)
    - $100k funding, among the highest in the country
    - number of difficult books: 
- Opportunity cost
    - I was working in London tech. I couldn't have continued because I was bored out, but if I had found something roughly as remunerative my earnings would have been around Â£((  (65000*1.15^1 + 65000*1.15^2 + 65000*1.15^3 + 65000*1.15^4) )), so I lost about $300k on previous trajectory, much more on the trajectory that Arb and the mask paper put me on
    - Not counting Arb though
- $0000 dollars of compute 
    - 8000 of Microsoft donated for one paper, say 50000 MCMC runs
    - Very hard to say what my share of the ACRC was, but basically very little
    - Spent a grand building a nicer desktop, but didn't really make much difference besides selling me on WSL



    - I asked my labmates what it was all about. They didn't really know how to answer the question


## Benefit
- [[PhD by numbers]]
- Confidence / Credibility
- Grit
- Scientific writing
- Government experience
- Clients
- Impact
- [[research taste]]
- [[what does a research advisor do?]]
- [[free shit with an institutional login]]


## Humans

Once I almost did a project with human participants -- some standard HCI experimental economics blah.



## Time

My reviewer advised that I budget 6 months for writing up the papers into a coherent thesis. My friend did his in 7 days (90 hours). I compromised and did it 227h. 




- # Cost
    - ## {{[[calc]]: ((150+30+250+60+700))}} hours
    - This is obviously hugely less than most people or the clock time.
    - Opportunity cost
        - $400k opportunity cost
        - Impact opportunity cost
            - probably not that much
    - Quals year: extraordinary pain and tedium
    - One breakdown
    - One friend
    - Artificial isolation. Covid somewhat to blame but not much
- ## Inputs
    - X textbooks
    - Y papers
    - Knowing Jan Brauner
- ## benefits
    - Emotional control
        - Massive confidence
        - Neutrality about maths. Emotional and proportion
    - Skill
        - Paper writing
    - Cynicism
        - Holy and credible contempt for people who use Dr in ordinary social contexts, those who require them in jobs. 
            - There is almost no quality control. Novelty is barely necessary, and utility not at all
    - Made friends with lecturers. 
        - Board games
    - Cred
        - Two clients
        - Government policy
- x years, y days
    - z hours
- xxxxx words, y pages
- 11 studies 
- 97 regressions
- 0 p-values 
- xx appendices
- xxx references
