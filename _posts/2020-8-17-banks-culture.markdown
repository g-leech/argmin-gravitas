> Liberalism is a technology for preventing civil war. It was forged in the fires of Hell – the horrors of the endless seventeenth century religious wars... from the burning wreckage, we drew forth this amazing piece of alien machinery. A machine that, when tuned just right, let people live together peacefully without doing the “kill people for being Protestant” thing. Popular historical strategies for dealing with differences have included: brutally enforced conformity, brutally efficient genocide, and making sure to keep the alien machine tuned really really carefully.

> <a href="{{sf}}">INTERVIEWER</a>: ...the Ships and Minds of the Culture, its great AIs: their outrageous names, their dangerous senses of humour. Is this what gods would actually be like?
<br><br>
BANKS: If we're lucky.

<br>

The two worst omissions from sci-fi are social development and software development. In his <a href="{{cult}}">_Culture_</a> series Banks covers the first so memorably, so thrillingly, that the series is a permanent touchstone for me, even though each individual book is actually not that strong. The Culture is actually different from us - even though underneath their society revs our great alien machine, liberalism unbound.

<!-- Banks was always quite open about how didactic his sci-fi was; it is saved by his inventiveness and psychological realism amidst technological fantasy. -->

Ada Palmer calls it "<a href="{{soc}}">social science fiction</a>", focussing on soft technology and cultural progress rather than rigorous physics and cool gadgets. <a href="{{penc}}">A pencil is technology</a>. But so is liberalism, in some sense. <a href="{{notes}}">Banks was a determinist</a>, and so denied the dichotomy: the technology creates the society. "Space minus scarcity implies anarchism."

How can anarchism be stable, though? Banks doesn't say it is: instead it's metastable. If your society is a matter of degree, if its only hard tenet is "do what you like if it doesn't hurt anyone", and if you don't need specialisation of labour, you can get away with decentralisation.

Almost all of the books center on Special Circumstances, the tiny military intelligence branch of the Culture. They are the least typical members of the Culture, often officially not members. They are central because their lives lend themselves to exciting fiction and because the tensions of the culture are most obvious there (see Critiques below).

As a novelist and a <a href="{{ken}}">standard Scottish radical</a>, Banks was incapable of writing a pure utopia: no story without problems. Every book has its greys and queasiness: there are three or four critiques of the Culture in the books, sometimes given by Culture citizens. He mostly solves this by having the antagonists be clearly much, much worse than the ultra-democratic luxury altruists. And I shouldn't overegg his pessimism: he is able, after all, to see a world with technological fixes to social organisation and individual suffering.

Banks' world is an achievement: he maintains narrative tension despite having supremely powerful protagonists, post-scarcity bliss, and post-Singularity rationality and benevolence. Culture floats free of physical constraints, and unlike most sci-fi (most fiction) he actually imagines us into that possibility. Where philosophy and art are almost the only big things left to do.

An easy formula is that you wouldn't want to live in _anyone_ else's utopia. This is too neat: I would be Culture if it was offered. It just falls short of the real radical optimum.

<br>


## What's so good about it?

> Briefly, nothing and nobody in the Culture is exploited. It is essentially an automated civilisation in its manufacturing processes, with human labour restricted to something indistinguishable from play, or a hobby.<br><br>
No machine is exploited, either; the idea here being that any job can be automated in such a way as to ensure that it can be done by a machine well below the level of potential consciousness...

* Post-scarcity. No greed.
* Post-disease.
* Post-death.
* Post-gender, post-race.
* No admin.
* Sustainable bliss. Fun recognised as the deep moral value it is.
* Full morphological freedom
* Ability to estimate consciousness and value and so promote it.
* Full positive and negative liberty
* Massive devaluation of ascribed identity in favour of achieved.
* Benevolent decentralised overlords. Unmitigated consent as iron law.
* Freedom of movement and exit. Partial identification ("80% Culture").
* Almost negligible crime, and so no criminal justice, and so no dedicated police or bureaucracy <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>.
* Almost no internal politics. 

Banks calls this anarchism, but it is equally a technocracy, or a million little benevolent dictatorships.

## Critiques of the Culture

### 1. Horza: the Culture as tutelage, just a game

> CNN: In the Culture’s post-scarcity society, where no one needs for anything, you’re removing a lot of the struggle around everyday life. Is that not removing the point of life itself?
<br><br>
BANKS: I think a lot of the struggle is kind of pointless and is in itself boring. The struggle for existence for most people most of the time, especially in a post-agricultural, industrial society, is a bit of a grind. People have to work very hard and awfully long hours for not a great deal of money: if you don’t, you get virtually nothing. Life’s not much fun, frankly, so I’d quite happily trade in that struggle.
<br><br>

> while they may be fun, hobbies are also at some level always frivolous. They cannot give meaning to a life, precisely because they are optional. You could just stop doing it, and nothing would change, it would make no difference, which is to say, it wouldn’t matter.

<br>

The humans are not the protagonists. Even when the books seem to have a human protagonist, doing large serious things, they are actually the agent of an AI's plan. (<a href="{{zak}}">Zakalwe</a> is a partial exception, because he can happily do immoral things the Minds don't want to do or make innocent Culture citizens do.) 

"The Minds in the Culture don't need the humans, and yet the humans need to be needed." (I think only a small number of humans need to be needed - or, only a small number of them need it enough to forgo the many comforts. Most people do not live on this scale. It's still a fine critique.)

The projects the humans take on risk inauthenticity. Almost anything they do, a machine could do better. What can you do? You can order the Mind to not catch you if you fall from the cliff you're climbing-just-because; you can delete the backups of your mind so that you are actually risking. You can also just leave the Culture and rejoin some old-fashioned, unfree "<a href="{{eval}}">strongly evaluative</a>" civ. The alternative is to evangelise freedom by joining Contact.

One of Banks' protagonists is anti-Culture. The boring version of his critique is that he dislikes machines ruling humans - their enemies are on the side of life - "boring, old-fashioned, biological life".  But the real point is that the Culture's all very well for the actively questing, protagonist Minds, but terrible for its lesser subjects, because nothing in their life is truly serious, counterfactual, functional. Horza thinks you need struggle, ultimate meaning, grand narrative. He sides with the Idirans because at least it's an ethos. (As always, the Culture partially assimilates this critique: one of them <a href="{{horz}}">names itself</a> after him and so his objection.)

There are objective limits to their egalitarianism (e.g. the artificial-intelligence Ships are straightforwardly superior to their organic charges):

<blockquote>
 Look at these humans!  How could such glacial slowness even be called life? An age could pass, virtual empires rise and fall in the time they took to open their mouths to utter some new inanity!
</blockquote>

and even the Ships have a status ladder:

<blockquote>
 there was a small amount of vicarious glamour associated with it; guarding the weirdo, letting it roam wherever it wanted, but maintaining the fraternal vigilance that such an enormously powerful craft espousing such an eccentric credo patently merited.
</blockquote>

<br>

#### 1b. Scruton: the Culture as idiot meaninglessness

>  the fulfilment of wishes is both one of civilisation's most powerful drives and arguably one of its highest functions; we wish to live longer, we wish to live more comfortably, we wish to live with less anxiety and more enjoyment, less ignorance and more knowledge than our ancestors did

<center>
	– Banks
</center><br>

Roger Scruton can always be counted upon to piss in the beer: <a href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2283/gloom-merchant">he believes</a> that ubiquitous wonder and joy is impossible, or would make us <a href="http://www.academia.edu/5695584/_Better_to_be_Socrates_dissatisfied_than_a_pig_satisfied_Against_Mills_argument_for_a_discontinuous_qualitative_distinction_between_pleasures.pdf">swinish</a> idiots, "a kind of postmodern individual" he doesn't want to be seated next to at a dinner party:<br />
<!--  -->
<blockquote>
	Everything deep in us depends upon our mortal condition, and while we can solve our problems and live in peace with our neighbours we can do so only through compromise and sacrifice. We are not, and cannot be, the kind of posthuman cyborgs that rejoice in eternal life, if life it is... The soul-less optimism of the transhumanists reminds us that we should be gloomy, since our happiness depends on it.
</blockquote>

Banks shares this worry to some extent; see (3) below for how his utopians are not really posthuman. "Luckily", the Culture citizens are not in fact free of suffering. For instance, <a href="{{ulver}}">Ulver</a> is incredibly annoying, annoyed, and shallow, and is the personification of Scruton's critique. (Admittedly she is a teenager, but why would we need teenagers?)

Critique (1) is about the sad need for authenticity and agency, not just freedom and fun.

(1a) is the (so-called) paradox of freedom: if you can do anything, if there are no fixed points, then your choice isn't meaningful.

<br>

### 2. Heath: the Culture as replicator

> The only desire the Culture could not satisfy from within itself was one common to both the descendants of its original human stock and the machines they had (at however great a remove) brought into being: the urge not to feel useless.  The Culture's sole justification for the relatively unworried, hedonistic life its population enjoyed was its good works; the secular evangelism of the Contact Section... actually interfering (overtly or covertly) in the historical processes of those other cultures.

The very best essay on the Culture is '<a href="{{heath}}">Why the Culture Wins</a>' by Joseph Heath. He notes that if we view the Culture from outside, as a replicator, then of course it needs a moral mission, of course it has to have interventionist compassion as a core value: that's how such a highly moral meme can spread itself. Despite being small and atypical, Contact is the heart of the Culture, its deep justification for itself.

> what does it mean to say that Contact arranges things so that the “good guys” win? It means that it interferes on the side that shares the same values as the Culture. There is more at stake here than just individual freedom. For instance, with the development of technology, every society eventually has to decide how to recognize machine intelligence, and to decide whether AIs should be granted full legal and moral personhood. The Culture, naturally, has a view on this question, but that’s because the Culture is run by a benevolent technocracy of intelligent machines... This is what gives the Culture its virulence – at a fundamental level, it exists only to reproduce itself. It has no other purpose.

<center>
	– Heath
</center>

<br>

The claim is: A society freed from the need to pay attention to reality, to produce, will be given over to intense memetic drift and competition.

> From a certain perspective, the Culture is not all that different from Star Trek’s Borg. The difference is that Banks tricks the reader into, in effect, sympathizing with the Borg. Indeed, his sly suggestion is that we – those of us living in modern, liberal societies – are a part of the Borg.

<center>
	– Heath
</center><br>

You can view any successful process as an amoral replicator. The real question is whether its instances have value - more value than the alternatives. Well...

<br>

### 3. Culture humans as insufficiently posthuman

I praised the level of social development in the books. But his humans aren't _radically_ different from us. Critique (1) and (2) only hurt because human nature in the Culture is still recognisable as our nature.

Culture citizens tend to not want to live more than 400 years for some reason. (Sheer deepity: "_death is regarded as part of life, and nothing, including the universe, lasts forever. It is seen as bad manners to try and pretend that death is somehow not natural; instead death is seen as giving shape to life._") I don't expect this to be true.

They are not beyond suffering and competitive stress: note <a href="{{ulver}}">Ulver</a>'s whining and tantrums. Grief is common, sometimes lasting a century. They don't take wild-animal suffering seriously.

Both humans and Minds are still status-conscious. A Ship which has too high a turnover of human population loses face among its peers. There are celebrities, and renowned artists, debutantes and limited capacity events. ("_Not being spoken to, not being invited to parties, finding sarcastic anonymous articles and stories about yourself in the information network; these are the normal forms of manner-enforcement_")

The humans are clever but not superintelligent. Why, when there is so much profound superintelligent material to understand?

Mostly humans remain with a pretty conservative tetrapod shape, despite their morphological freedom. This implies a lot of conformism and herding (even just our heavy constraints on attractiveness).

Banks has the books' distinction between biological humans and AIs coming after a period in which there was no distinction, where the humans were more integrated and cyberised. It's not clear why you'd return.

Some of them still have conservative ideas of meaning. "_The Culture's sole justification for the relatively unworried, hedonistic life its population enjoyed was its good works._" As if pleasure and freedom needed further justification! This mania for authenticity is realistic but painful. The desire to experience and create things seems to me to be a complete substitute for the desire for status, for feeling useful, for validation. But to put it mildly this isn't universal yet.

The tech is mostly stagnant, apparently because of physical limits.

To some extent the above legacies could be Banks leaning on existing human traits in order to write good relatable fiction, rather than his own philosophy. But not wholly or mostly. 

<br>

### 4. The Culture as (partial) reverse alignment?

AI alignment is the process of making sure that your systems act for the benefit of people, even when the systems are much more powerful than humanity. In Banks' books, there's some evidence that the reverse has happened, of aligning humans to Minds.

There is a weird absence of resentment and power-seeking among the posthumans. As we know them, humans constantly chafe under government; the lighter the oppression, <a href="{{moyn}}">the more obvious</a> the chafing. Only a small number of humans are driven to lead and orchestrate large moral projects. And we see almost no unilateral human folly: we don't see any <a href="{{thatch}}">doomed human coups</a>, for instance.

The example I've spotted is <a href="{{marain}}">the Culture language</a> being engineered to produce certain philosophies in its speakers. (Sapir-Whorf is false for natural language, but who knows what can be done when you have control over both the processor and the instructions?) Maybe by the 8th millennium they've already done all they need to; maybe they are beyond man-machine politics because the humans were subtly shaped until there were no more tensions that needed politics.

Now, humans as we are are sorely in need of shaping, and the Minds are mostly far more moral than us. However, there are marks of subterfuge which you wouldn't want to see in a utopia.

This critique is not particularly biting, since humans remain awkward and recalcitrant, and need to be bribed on the occasions where a Mind wants them to do something. There are still some awful passions: murderous or sex-mad.




<br>


### 5. The Culture as imperialism

>  the Culture doesn't actively encourage immigration; it looks too much like a disguised form of colonialism. Contact's preferred methods are intended to help other civilisations develop their own potential as a whole, and are designed to neither leech away their best and brightest, nor turn such civilisations into miniature versions of the Culture.

For completeness I should mention this, though I think it is misguided at best. The Contact division presume to convert illiberal (e.g. torture porn) civilisations to utilitarianism (mostly via diplomacy and positive incentives rather than through their overwhelming <a href="{{gun}}">gunboats</a>). They also police large parts of known space, preventing as many conflicts as they can. 

There are people who, reacting to the terrible parts of our history of foreign intervention, reject all such intervention. (They sometimes <a href="{{ass}}">prohibit</a> <a href="{{neo}}">even nonviolent intervention</a>.)

This is slightly blunted by the above passage: it's only nonsuffering and tolerance that they enforce on others, rather than hedonism, polymorphism, atheism, anarchism. (OK, they also stomp carbon chauvinism.)

The Prime Directive of _Star Trek_ is a fictional example of this. They're supposed to ignore non-space-faring civilisations, up to and including letting them die in natural cataclysms. However, the writers and the characters reject it all of the time: it's violated in <a href="{{alpha}}">dozens of episodes</a>, generally in a way that strikes me as blatantly the right thing to do. This is because the principle sounds better than it is.


To be fair I should reconstruct an actual argument:

1. There are no single true values, or anyway we don't know them. (Philosophy is too weak, or we are.)
2. If we don't have the true values, we cannot justify imposing our values on others.
2. So we cannot justify imposing our values on others.
3. So do not intervene when values conflict.

(This doesn't stop us intervening in a society when its own values are violated by external forces, like natural risks or other invaders.)

Premise 2 is the weak one. We know of many things which are universally bad for mammals. What we lack is <a href="{{soares}}">a precise statement of the good</a>. But that torture or genocide is bad is not very culturally mediated!

There are difficult forms of the concern though: 

* What does the Absolute Liberal do <a href="{{paradox}}">with intolerant enemies</a>? 
* What can you do with people who don't want freedom, tolerance, management, diversity?

Critique (2) is related to this, but I think that's just the descriptive form. 

<br><br>




## Vulnerabilities

The Culture is <a href="{{ex}}">mostly</a> shown as more powerful than its foes, able to adapt and match whatever threat, in almost all cases without even compromising its own values. Ships produce Ships, so any big Ship could reconstruct the whole civilisation given time. How then could the Culture fail?


### 1. Running out of moral patients

<div class="accordion">
	<h3>Morality, big and small</h3>
	<div>
		Ordinary morality holds that saving one life from one dramatic hazard once is <a href="https://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/2016/10/the-origins-of-the-precept-whoever-saves-a-life-saves-the-world/">the supreme act</a>: people who have done it are proud about it for the rest of their lives. Call <i>epic morality</i>, any system for which that's the <i>minimum</i> unit regarded.<br><br>
		<!--  -->
		What larger things could you aim at? It could just be life-saving on a grand scale, or timescale: like working on a project which is unlikely to complete in your lifetime. Then there are things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SENS_Research_Foundation">ending death</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_animal_suffering">ending suffering</a>, <a href="https://futureoflife.org/2017/02/03/align-artificial-intelligence-with-human-values/">aligning the general AI's values</a> with ours, using our full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_extinction#Moral_importance_of_existential_risk">cosmic endowment</a> and <a href="https://foundational-research.org/files/Multiverse-wide-Cooperation-via-Correlated-Decision-Making.pdf">more</a>. In Banks' utopia, sketched out in the ten <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture">Culture</a></i> novels, all of these projects except the last are complete. 
		<br><br>
		Epic morality provides firm and serious meaning to those conducting it. It is a fine substitute for theism: the <a href="https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedonist.htm#naturalisation">naturalisation of heaven</a>. And there's the problem: if we finish our epic projects, which in these stories the Culture is at risk of doing, then philosophy and groundlessness will rush back in to spoil things.
	</div>
</div>
<br>

> the Culture accepts, generally, that questions such as 'What is the meaning of life?' are themselves meaningless... we make our own meanings, whether we like it or not.

Banks gives the Culture an ultimate meaning (roughly, reducing suffering and promoting freedom), but it's contingent: it needs to keep finding people to help. Assuming that no faction goes totalitarian and starts engineering new terrible societies, a crisis of legitimacy should eventually come. (Though since they don't even fully cover one galaxy by the end of the timeline, it'll be a while.) 

Even then, there's no real prospect of a successful human revolt. So nothing left to do except Sublime, chase other realities.

<a href="{{jac}}">Alan Jacobs'</a> standard sniffy zero-sum critique ("a society without internal struggles will need always to generate external ones") is unfair and anyway unnecessary for this to be a vulnerability.


### 2. Meeting a stronger replicator.

Banks' world contains <a href="{{swarm}}">Hegemonising Swarms</a>: collections of self-replicating matter, not sentient, not creative, just very good at destruction, reproduction, and travel. Swarms are the logical extreme of an illiberal foe: one with no values, only reproduction. <a href="{{watts}}">Watts' _Blindsight_</a> contains a formidable sort. (All of the very powerful agents in Banks' books are sentient: he tacitly assumes, against Watts, that consciousness is adaptive.)

The Culture spends most of its resources on recreation. (The Minds are not vigilant, spending large amounts of time in an intellectual opium haze.) Even if we grant Heath's cultural evolution point, Contact is a vastly expensive and slow method of reproduction compared to a Swarm. Then there's the unseriousness of everyone (Human spy: "<i>He'd thought about saying, Well, actually I was in [the secret service], kind of a spy, really, and I know lots of secret codes and stuff...</i>")

Most of the potential sentient threats to the Culture have "sublimed" (dematerialised); the Culture is an aberration, kept in reality by their civilising mission. (There are maybe a dozen "Involved" civilisations on their level.) But there's nothing to stop another civ with a conflicting moral and more focus on fast spread also refusing to go buddha.


### 3. Space Balkanisation

> the forces of repression need to win every time, the progressive elements need only triumph once.

<center>
	– Banks
</center><br>

Each Ship is a nation-state. The anarchic collection of mobile states works because there is a strong vetting process for new minds, which prunes away the psychos and megalomaniacs, and provides a bedrock of strong Millian consequentialism in nearly all Minds. (One of the few rogue elements in the series, the _Attitude Adjuster_, is still a good utilitarian with a horror of killing, and is utterly overcome by guilt at the deaths it causes while trying to end a systematic torture culture.)

Even so, the Culture has no mechanism for preventing schisms, besides the meta one of 1) basic shared consequentialism, 2) not limiting its members enough to make it necessary to schism. The path to failure is ideological drift -> civil war or recursive schisms -> lack of coordination -> military loss.

The ship training process is imperfect, and there are still <a href="{{ult}}">schisms</a> and hot conflicts in the Culture among the aligned Minds. In his early theoretical notes, he talks about the difficult process of becoming the Culture: overcoming many intolerant local minima, and phrases the Culture as what happens when your hegemony is so total that you don't need to enforce it anymore. But conflict still lurks out there, even when you're beyond economic and strategic concerns.

They seem to have no central authentication or strategists, only temporary committees. The military, and even the secret service, are fully decentralised, subvertible by any single high-status rogue.

Almost none of the humans in <i>Excession</i> are actually wholeheartedly 'in' the Culture; instead there are only factions: the Elench, the AhForgetIt, and an allophile Culture diplomat who ends up defecting entirely. Maybe the Culture is <i>constituted</i> of people who don't feel totally in it, but who recognise that everyone else is worse.

Big reasons for hope:

* The Culture's ship fertility rate could easily be high enough to indefinitely replace these defections.
* The ex-Culture factions depicted still co-operate a lot. Their philosophical differences do not extend to deep casus-belli questions. (Exception: the Elench's pathological curiosity and touchy-feeliness.)
* Placing no barriers on separatism, while retaining ideological agreement on harm, lets the Culture seem much smaller than it is while maintaining an otherwise-threatening extent.
* Status markets. There is still positional scarcity, and reputational risks, which prevents most bad behaviour and wireheading. "<i>one of the many tiny but significant and painful ways a Ship could lose face amongst its peers was through a higher than average crew turn-over rate</i>"


<br><br>


## Misc

* Subliming is a really, really bad plot device. To stop recursive self-improvement and first-mover advantage from making his galaxy boring, Banks has all of the really powerful civs voluntarily dematerialise for mysterious spiritual reasons. Even in a soft world (with e.g. basically no energy constraints), this breaks fictional belief. Maybe he had plans to make it less bad which he didn't get around to; maybe it would have tied it to the extra-dimensional beings of _Excession_.

* The Minds are not improving much; <a href="{{itg}}">ancient ones</a> orchestrate many of the grand successful space operas. This is odd.

* The Minds are funny. They are addicted to <a href="{{irreal}}">super videogames</a>. They gossip, and they plot, and they can dislike each other. They do all this a billion times faster than us, in amusing cryptographic ways, but they remain comprehensible and likeable superintelligences. We should expect even aligned superintelligences to be much stranger than this: <a href="{{design}}">mind design space</a> is too large, and our concepts too small, for it to be otherwise.

<!-- * It is right to be sceptical of markets: they are optimisers that do not have our objective in mind. But Banks goes further, and ignores the hard constraints on central planning. This only works because  -->

* The Culture are against terraforming - an odd apparent bit of bioconservative ideology. But this seems to be mostly a matter of efficiency: <a href="{{hab}}">artificial habitats are much more efficient</a>.

* If there is anything to the neocolonialism / <a href="http://www.e-ir.info/2013/10/30/liberalism-another-tool-of-western-hegemony/">'liberal hegemony'</a> suspicion, the sad fact remains that it's a less bad hegemony than the others.

* There are no religions in the Culture, not even relatively rational ones like simulationism (shown in a different Banks book) or panpsychism or deism. With so much free time, alongside sports, art, and philosophy, I expect humans to get into unprecedently odd metaphysics.

* Minds have strong emotions (e.g. the ROU <i>Killing Time</i>'s kamikaze fury).

* They have brain uploads, but they're mostly just in storage and are greatly outnumbered by embodied people.

* The Minds run incredibly detailed simulations of terrible situations; there's no attention to whether this is morally risky.


<br>


<!-- The Culture's liberalism is far beyond ours, though: they are the great choice-preserving meta-civilization, a rational anarchy. I think the books are compelling, amidst the great sea of boring utopias, because their Culture is not psychologically utopian: there are still status games (your ancestry, how close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Circumstances">diplomatic corps</a> you are); still maudlin existential angst; and t -->

<!-- (I was considering whether lack of economic incentive would mean that the Culture would lack human volunteers - but the foregoing status games and the deeper urge to do something useful is more than enough, particularly when backed by decades of leisure, i.e. enough to get bored with. And few humans are needed by that stage anyway.) -->
