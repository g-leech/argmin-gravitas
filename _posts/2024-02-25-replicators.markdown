> [Newell] and I wrote out the rules for the components of the program (subroutines) in English on index cards, and also made up cards for the contents of the memories (the axioms of logic)... on a dark winter evening in January 1956, we assembled my wife and three children together with some graduate students. To each member of the group, we gave one of the cards, so that each person became, in effect, a component of the LT computer program --- a subroutine that performed some special function, or a component of its memory. It was the task of each participant to execute his or her subroutine, or to provide the contents of his or her memory, whenever called by the routine at the next level above that was then in control.<br><br>So we were able to simulate the behavior of LT with a computer constructed of human components. Here was nature imitating art imitating nature. The actors were no more responsible for what they were doing than the slave boy in Plato's Meno, but they were successful in proving the theorems given them.

Life.

Dynasties, stationary bandits. States. "the coldest of all cold monsters"


# Hijacking

At first, we could only steal.

> the complementarity of replication and metabolism (broadly defined to include energy production) is the biological manisfestation of the dualism of information (entropy) and energy, as beautifully explained by Schroedinger 

Jeremy England's Statistical Physics of Self-Replication proposes that self-replication is fueled by entropy.

> evolution itself is an epiphenomenon of replication: selection, drift and parasite formation necessarily ensue as soon as replication with sufficient fidelity

# Abstraction is efficient

> The technium is the sphere of visible technology and intangible organizations that form what we think of as modern culture. It is the current accumulation of all that humans have created. For the last 1,000 years, this techosphere has grown about 1.5% per year. It marks the difference between our lives now, verses 10,000 years ago. Our society is as dependent on this technological system as nature itself. Yet, like all systems it has its own agenda. Like all organisms the technium also wants.

> Nothing human makes it out of the near-future. ... This is because what appears to humanity as the history of capitalism is an invasion from the future by an artificial intelligent space that must assemble itself entirely from its enemy's resources.

> all capital is temporary. When people talk about the "agglomeration of capital", it can invoke ideas of building stocks of factories and tools and vaults of gold or whatever that generate wealth indefinitely, but that doesn't happen. Those factories shred, degrade, become outdated, need to pivot, etc in a matter of years. The economy has to be perpetually worked to generate value. "Agglomeration of capital" is not a stock of permanent wealth, its a stock of present wealth that gives you the power to dictate future wealth and its construction. And most of that wealth is the human capital, the org structures, the commercial relations. The buildings and tools are always cheap in comparison to those. Which is why bombing doesn't impact long run ecomic growth.
