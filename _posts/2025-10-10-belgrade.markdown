Three days before I arrived in Belgrade, Serb paramilitaries [skirmished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjska_attack) with Kosovar police: 4 dead. Tanks rolled.

The day after I arrived, there was a 1000-person rally just outside my Airbnb window - Kosovska Street - choked voices screaming into megaphones. But turns out they do this every Saturday, and it's not [necessarily](https://www.dw.com/en/serbia-belgrade-rocked-by-anti-government-protests/a-65817502) about the Kosovars.

It took about 10 days for my anxious sense of being an unwilling part of History, in mad environs, to fade.

Also various petty things - smoking in restaurants, mosquitoes, diesel fumes, bare concrete, fag ads, omnigraffiti, shock when you refuse a plastic bag. But I got over it.

They left up the old bombed Defence Ministry building, right in the centre of town. I guessed this was a little symbol to keep the rage.

: Sleaze; good sleaze, like alt Berlin. Reminds me a lot of Britain in the 90s. Supposedly you can get testosterone otc. There's nearly no CCTV anywhere.

The upside of sleaze is genuineness. Not a lot of hollow corporate slickness around. Lots of unsuppressed local variation.

Weather was incredibly good. 26 degrees in mid-October.

Town is really not that polluted in the summer, but the lignite plants a couple miles away produce an opaque smog in winter and make it the [worst place](https://t.co/VQIqKG7POi) in Europe.

To get around noise ordinances the late clubs are floating rafts - "splavs".  "a half–decomposed place where people sit in bikinis and drink lemonade". One sank on New Year's with about 700 people on board. (The rafts are licensed for 200.)

Playlist turned out great, though it's hard to disentangle Serbia from the wider Yugoslav powerhouse of funk and new wave.

How can you possibly compare cuisines internationally? Quality of a random meal? Quality of top places/bibs gourmand? 

Anyway, Serbia does extremely well on the latter, couple of my top 20 meals in the world. (and vegetarian is a tough constraint for most!) Empty tables

The lemonade is unsweetened by default, which I love. 

The water is hard enough to leave calcium residue on the cup when boiled. 

People are obsessed with Plazma, a local biscuit that you can get a McDonald's shake of.



The castle is incredible. There's a nightclub in the basement, in the old shell magazine. "The Fortress of Good Fun"

Also Great War Island, a big nature reserve within plain sight of the old town and new town. Shelled by the Ottomans so hard you feel it 100 years on

Not much Ottoman influence left besides the hammams and fortress. Communism echoes much more strongly.

The alphabets used in the street are now about 80:20 Roman to Cyrillic. Government business is still all cyrillic.

As in most of eastern Europe, meds cost twice what they should, because the people suffer under an apothecary monopoly.


The prime minister is gay. But locals tell me this is yet more brilliant fuckery from Vučić: his (de facto) appointing her makes him look good in the EU, while the country's vast homophobia means that she is powerless and can't challenge him on anything.

Saw this in a restaurant, a first. Turns out it's the 3rd highest rate of civilian gun ownership in the world, after the US and Yemen; 39 guns per 100 people.

Slowly changing; about 1% of them were handed in in the last post school-shooting amnesty.

Am I the only one who finds the imperial eagle-snake slightly sinister?

Is any culture both unfriendly and corrupt? America is both of the opposite.

Some rich theory to be done about politeness vs generosity, bureaucracy vs relating, atomisation vs whisper net mob norms, warmth to family and warmth to strangers. Soviet Union.
