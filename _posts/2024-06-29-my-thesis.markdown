> When working on a PhD, you must focus on a topic so narrow that you can understand it completely. It will seem at first that you're working on the proverbial needle, a tiny fragment of the world, a minute crystal, beautiful but in the scheme of things, microscopic. Work with it. And the more you work with it, the more you penetrate it, the more you will come to see that your work, your subject, encompasses the world. In time, you will come to see the world in your grain of sand.

A thesis is nominally a __unified__ contribution to knowledge. Something new, several pieces of knowledge all pointing in the same direction. I am not focussed enough to do this. It's also a big claim. I obviously had to retrodict a single big claim, and surely most people do the same. 
        <!-- - [[concocting a coherent PhD (2023)]] -->



I'm not amazed with it as a contribution to science but it is a pretty good representation of my mind: unfocussed, sweeping, long on synthesis, short on analysis, more amusing than deep but not not deep.


It's called Methods Failing the Data, Data Failing the Methods (they made me change it just before submission but I see no reason to view the university's title as the true title).


Here's an attempt to explain plainly what I actually did. (You can also click "The Point" on the individual papers <a href="/researches">here</a>.)


## Official conclusions

I bring lessons from metascience into Bayesian practice and into broader machine learning practice. 
I also attempt to compare evidential standards in these fields.


## Unofficial conclusions

* It's surprisingly easy to do real work in fields you have zero background in. This is partly because stats now reigns imperial in roughly all sciences but also because many fields are in some sense methodologically shallow and content deep.

* All solutions to bad science have their own vulnerabilities and/or high costs. This war will never end. 

* It's pretty fishy how few retractions there are in machine learning. (In every field, but especially machine learning.)

* We don't win on average (the average paper is very bad and will always be fairly bad) but as long as our filtering mechanism allows us to continue to find the best 1% which actually progress us, we'll be okay. This filter is also under strain.

* [[ML ate AI]]  [[stat ML ate ML]]  [[ML ate stats]]

A real phd. Discoveries. You know, something like

The Point

Discoveries 
- mandate method doesn't work (hundreds of papers)

Negative results
- ILP
- GJOpen
- EPJ


Current publication process makes salesmen out of scientists 

A PhD thesis needs to be sold far less. (If you've already published) It has to be novel and it has to kowtow to precedents, but you can be really honest about the small magnitude within those loose constraints
