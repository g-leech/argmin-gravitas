> When working on a PhD, you must focus on a topic so narrow that you can understand it completely. It will seem at first that you're working on the proverbial needle, a tiny fragment of the world, a minute crystal, beautiful but in the scheme of things, microscopic. Work with it. And the more you work with it, the more you penetrate it, the more you will come to see that your work, your subject, encompasses the world. In time, you will come to see the world in your grain of sand.

A thesis is nominally a __unified__ contribution to knowledge. Something new, several pieces of knowledge all pointing in the same direction. I am not focussed enough to do this. It's also a big claim. I obviously had to retrodict a single big claim, and surely most people do the same. 
        <!-- - [[concocting a coherent PhD (2023)]] -->



I'm not amazed with it as a contribution to science but it is a pretty good representation of my mind: unfocussed, sweeping, long on synthesis, short on analysis, more amusing than deep but not not deep.


It's called _Methods Failing the Data, Data Failing the Methods_ (they made me change it before submission but I see no reason to view the university's title as the true title).


Here's an attempt to explain plainly what I actually did. (You can also click "The Point" on the individual papers <a href="/researches">here</a>.)


## Official conclusions

- What have I actually discovered?

## COVID

- Mass voluntary uptake of masking
- Invalid methodology, Mandate proxy
- OxCGRT fatal data problem, unusable
- Peak seasonality. We take a bunch of case data and try to work out the "seasonality", how much the disease weakens between summer and winter. This requires us to work out the peak intensity day, the top of the seasonal effect. We reliably infer the peak as 1st January. Probably coincidence, but ALSO could be that the astronomers who consulted on the Gregorian calendar nailed it.


Mask wearing in community settings reduces SARS-CoV-2 transmission
    Noted the global pre-mandate voluntary spike in mask wearing
    Identified a ubiquitous methodological mistake (the mandate timing proxy)
    First international analysis of masks with a random sample of self-reported mask wearing data. Constructed and validated a global dataset from multiple sources.
    First Bayesian hierarchical model for mask wearing, adapting existing NPI model of {\small\cite{Braunereabd9338}}. Functional form modelling effects of mask wearing.

## Unofficial conclusions

* It is a Gelmanian work, in that I cite him 73 times and in every chapter, and in that it is self-elected science police work, in that it skips merrily across disciplinary boundaries, and in that its tone is stubbornly irreverent

* It's surprisingly easy to do real work in fields you have zero background in. This is partly because stats now reigns imperial in roughly all sciences but also because many fields are in some sense methodologically shallow and content deep.

* All solutions to bad science have their own vulnerabilities and/or high costs. This war will never end. 

* It's pretty fishy how few retractions there are in machine learning. (In every field, but especially machine learning.)

* We don't win on average (the average paper is very bad and will always be fairly bad) but as long as our filtering mechanism allows us to continue to find the best 1% which actually progress us, we'll be okay. This filter is also under strain.

* [[ML ate AI]]  [[stat ML ate ML]]  [[ML ate stats]]

A real phd. Discoveries. You know, something like

<img src="/img/riechers.png" />



I was only really intellectual lead on ILP, reversals, masks, hard problems. 



The Point

Discoveries 
- mandate method doesn't work (hundreds of papers)

Negative results
- ILP
- GJOpen
- EPJ


Current publication process makes salesmen out of scientists 

A PhD thesis needs to be sold far less. (If you've already published) It has to be novel and it has to kowtow to precedents, but you can be really honest about the small magnitude within those loose constraints

## Natty STEM

I did it without hardcore stimulants, as did I think most of my cohort. Tried one dose of vyvanse. Modafinil's effects are entirely the wrong target. Couple mg of nicotine a day. No caffeine.
