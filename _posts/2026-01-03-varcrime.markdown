When someone takes my wallet from me, I say "Egad! You have reduced my expected utility!" When someone e.g. invents a powerful technology, they have boosted the expectation of my life but also cranked up the variance. When is this wrong, a varcrime?

My favourite new term of last year was "[farming variance](https://x.com/g_leech_/status/1991807866983113170)".

### Permissionlessness

Everything depends on permissionless innovation.


### Farming the variance

What do we mean by “farming variance”?

Individual level: applying to 100 scholarships instead of 10; doing 10 small pilot projects instead of one grand plan; submitting the same paper to the same conference under four different titles.
Organizational level: venture portfolios; skunkworks labs; randomized A/B tests; policy pilots across cities; seeding many independent teams to attack a problem in parallel.
Societal level: regulatory sandboxes; prize competitions; diversified national R&D bets; immigration/education lotteries.



When is it good to farm? When is it good to be forced to farm variance?


### Expected Utility Maximiser (VNMbot)

E[U(X)], and variance doesn't appear in that formula.
Risk aversion is encoded in the curvature of U, not by caring about variance separately. If U is concave (diminishing marginal utility), the agent effectively dislikes variance because Jensen's inequality implies E[U(X)] < U(E[X]) for mean-preserving spreads. If U is linear, variance is irrelevant. If U is convex, they actually prefer variance.

### Risk-Aware Optimisation ()

mean-variance optimization (maximizing μ - λσ²) 

An approximation: Taylor expanding E[U(X)] ≈ U(μ) + ½U''(μ)σ² shows variance matters to second order
A special case: CARA utility U(x) = -e^(-ax) with normal returns gives mean-variance preferences exactly

### Coase / Pigou

We actually have three very strong theories of how to handle imposed risk and imposed

Risk Imposition Ethics
The ethics literature on imposing risks on others distinguishes between voluntary risk-taking, risks imposed with consent, and risks imposed without consent, with particular focus on "pure risk" impositions that show inadequate respect for someone's status as a moral equal. The question of whether increasing variance while holding expectation constant is wrongful maps onto this.
Key Moral Frameworks
Contractualism (especially Scanlon) is considered the most promising approach. Contractualists assess whether principles permitting risk impositions can be reasonably rejected, with "ex ante" contractualism focusing on expected burdens (probability × harm) versus "ex post" contractualism focusing on actual outcomes Brill. Pure mean-preserving spreads create a puzzle: ex ante contractualism might permit them (same expected harm), but this seems to ignore legitimate concerns about variance itself.
Rights-based theories face what Nozick identified: if you have a right not to be killed, do you have a right against all actions that increase the probability you'll be killed? A strict interpretation would make human society impossible, but finding credible criteria for when such rights can be overridden remains problematic Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
Utilitarianism typically opposes mean-preserving spreads by construction - if people have concave utility functions (risk aversion), increasing variance reduces expected utility even at constant expected outcome. But this builds the answer into the framework rather than treating it as a separate moral question.
Specific Issue: Paternalism
Recent work argues that imposing risk-neutrality on patients (as done in QALY-based health policy) constitutes indefensible paternalism, since people may rationally have non-neutral risk attitudes Wiley Online Library. This directly addresses your question: even if two treatments have identical expected outcomes, imposing the higher-variance option on someone who prefers stability could be wrongful paternalism.

The upshot: Moral theory hasn't converged on an answer, but the question is actively discussed. The variance imposition is morally significant when:

It violates autonomy/consent
It shows disrespect for someone's reasonable risk preferences
It's done with culpable indifference rather than unavoidable limits

But there's no consensus framework that cleanly separates the permissibility of expectation-changes from variance-changes.

(There's an obvious connection here with the inequality-hating tradition, e.g. Rawlsians.)
