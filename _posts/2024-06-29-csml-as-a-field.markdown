>  Mind seems able to impress some of its highest attributes upon matter, and to create its own rival in the wheels and levers of an insensible machine.

> The average number of undergraduate CS majors at universities in the U.S. and Canada tripled in the decade after 2005, and it keeps growing. Students’ interest in CS is intellectual—culture moves through computation these days—but it is also professional. Young people hope to access the wealth, power, and influence of the technology sector.

In particular, credit to my 2018 self for spotting it earlier than 99.99% of the world. (No credit to him for not buying NVDA - but even that is passable as diversification, since one's AI career is an illiquid bet on AI.)


A decent chunk of my thesis is about looking at the whole field at once.

- ML is a mongrel field. (And AI is a mongrel of mongrels). I love mongrels.


### what does ML consist of?


- You do some mathematics to derive an objective
    - I probably couldn't have gotten a math phd. 
- You translate that into something you can actually implement
    - I probably couldn't have gotten an applied math phd. 
- You write some code, mostly now just a hundred lines of Lightning which Facebook pays genuises millions to optimise for you
    - I probably couldn't have gotten a software phd. 
- You debug
- You wait while your machine slowly builds a million models and throws the first 999,999 away.
    - I probably couldn't have gotten a phd in anything which really required patience. 
- You do some haphazard statistics to imply that the result is robust
    - I probably could've gotten a stats phd because it is also a mongrel discipline with lots of implicit judgment involved, where it is not a maths phd with better funding
- 
- But ML is a mongrel and rewards or at least tolerates those who are ok at these 4 things.

### Computer scientists

- I usually don't identify as things. But I am proud of computer scientists. I hope to be one someday. They marry the best of philosophy and the best of engineering.
- Many CS grads you will meet will be awful, because in the last two decades it became the default choice for heartless preprofessionals. But this doesn't reflect on the real CS people or the subject

> deep learning research success is largely about luck. The hypothesis space is very large and predicting what will work is very hard. (If someone can systematically check more things they’ll do better, but I think the field might be efficient at that).This leads to my extra secret hot corollary: visionary deep learning people probably don’t have more insight than the average (or even *bad*) deep learning people.

### me and cs
 
I decided to become technical only after my first degree, philosophy. I did a lot of philosophy of science and Continental stuff, and realised in being repelled by the latter and enchanted by the former that there was an entirely different kind of philosophy open only to the technical (or philosopher geniuses who can reinvent the technical when they need to). Beyond verbal philosophy.

I am not a natural at CS. Not patient, not 

I would have done worse in a philosophy degree - the standards are higher, I'm not naturally pedantic enough for analytic philosophy, and I can't abide the .

I would have done pretty well in an information studies or some social science programme - but I would have lost out, since I need to be surrounded by more rigorous people and be forced to not indulge.
