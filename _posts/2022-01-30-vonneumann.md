An awaited book; in fact I awaited it before I knew it was being written. Here is one of the most important people to ever live, and what notice do we take? Before now: One bad old biography (and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29506.Prisoner_s_Dilemma" rel="nofollow noopener">one-third</a> of another) and many gigantic maths monographs. Such yawning gaps come from historians and biographers being obsessed with artists instead - consider the nine Jane Austen biographies published in the last 11 years - and our scientists being inarticulate at best. unable or unwilling to stand up for themselves, and unrepresented by the chattering classes. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>


It is incredibly difficult to cover everything von Neumann did - everything he did for the first time in history - even just everything with vast practical consequences which are still felt 60 years later. 

* Chapter 2: fixing set theory where Hilbert and Russell failed
* Chapter 3: unifying matrix and wave theory where Dirac bodged and others failed
* Chapter 4: solution to a profound engineering challenge which changed the world forever
* ...

Great philosophers get several kinds of books written about them - two are the Life (which gossips about their upbringing and vices), and the intellectual biography (which actually tries to explain and show the development of their ideas). Bhattacharya’s is more like the latter plus a smattering of parties, fast cars, and intellectual bitching.<br>

<a href="/turing-bio">Hodges</a> is, in 600 pages, just able to enumerate Turing's achievements. Bhattacharya, in 284, is not even vaguely able to do this for vN. e.g. Almost no mention of his great work in group theory.

<br>

<br>

Very incomplete list of von Neumann’s achievements:<br><br>

* <i>Foundations of maths</i>: Paradox-free foundation of set theory with classes (superceded Russell)<br>

* <i>Physics</i>: Unification of matrix mechanics and wave mechanics (superceded Dirac)<br>

* <i>Physics:</i>: proof of the Ergodic hypothesis<br>

* <i>Lots of group theory</i>, chiefly operator algebras<br>

* <i>Foundations of QM</i>: axiomatisation of QM, unified wave and matrix mechanics.<br>

* <i>Physics:</i> Clarified the measurement problem (for the first time?)<br>

* <i>Physics:</i>: Central work on the Copenhagen interpretation <br>

* <i>Physics / logic</i> Founded quantum logic<br>

* <i>Economics</i>: Proved existence and uniqueness of general equilibrium <br>

* <i>Physics:</i> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09305 " rel="nofollow noopener">Much-misunderstood constraint on all hidden variable theories</a>. Maybe gappy.<br>

* <i>linear programming</i>: duality and the first interior point method.<br>

* <i>Fluid dynamics</i>: Fat Man implosion lens design. Discovery of the airburst efficiency. Many solutions in blast waves.<br>

* Hardware engineering: Redesigned the ENIAC to be the first stored program computer<br>

* Computer engineering: Earliest partial design of a modern computer. Lifted lots from Mauchly and Eckert (uncredited) but greatly superceded them.<br>

* Patent busting on the digital computer design. Free for all.<br>

* Minimax and dozens of central results in game theory<br>

* Founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem" rel="nofollow noopener">utility theory</a><br>

* Marrying neuroscience and computer science forever<br>

* Founded automata theory<br>

* <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7530868-theory-of-self-reproducing-automata" rel="nofollow noopener">Intelligence explosion as x-risk</a><br>

* …<br><br>

Bhattacharya covers about half of these.<br>

---

<br>

* The most important question in all of education: How did Hungary produce so many geniuses? Why did they stop? The second has an obvious answer (the Holocaust), but the first is tricky. Theories of Jewish excellence do not suffice: why Hungary instead of Poland (ten times larger population), Czechoslovakia, Britain? von Neumann’s own answer was the empire’s weird mix of 1) tolerance and rewards for Jewish people, while 2) still being extremely volatile and so making them uncertain how long this would last and so rushing to succeed.<br><br>

* Bhattacharya’s informalisation of the technical results here is impressive. At least one fuckup though: on p112 he confuses completeness for correctness.<br><br>

* At one point AB ties the Hilbert and Gödel work to modernism. Modernist mathematics, the rejection of the past, the flight into abstraction and rigour. As if this was a general spirit. I don’t know how to evaluate this idea.<br><br>

* Sad to hear that a heavily modified ENIAC executed a stored program two months before the Manchester Baby. I hate to see the Man win over the garage nerds.<br><br>

* Nash is nasty, well before he goes psychotic (self-aggrandising, straw Vulcan, racist). He makes von Neumann look soft and warm.<br><br>

* Lovelace is not the first programmer. Klári von Neumann has a much better claim (if we insist on ignoring Babbage).<br><br>

* So many brilliant people here, and far more obscure than JvN. Shapley, Barricelli, Collbohm, Goldstine, Harsanyi, McCarthy, Adele and Klári…<br><br>

## Err

We tend to deify people, and they never deserve it. What did von Neumann get wrong?<br><br>

#### <b>Mutually Assured Destruction</b><br>

It's not obvious that this was a mistake - we're still here, MAD is a strong reason not to intentionally nuke people. But the sheer number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls" rel="nofollow noopener">near misses</a> and the overall estimate of <a href="https://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/blog/post/less-hollywood-more-car-crash" rel="nofollow noopener">0.1%</a> annual state risk, should make us think that the strategy was actually poor, that we are walking selection bias. <br>The less obvious response is that he knew all that and was trading some existential risk to block the Soviet Empire's anti-human practices from taking over. Since this argument also works for the Soviets, or for any value system which values itself, he seems to have settled for an appalling equilibrium. Tragedy of the value lock-in commons.<br><br>

VN wanted cooperation, wanted a long life for humanity. But he couldn’t trust enough not to escalate. The true altruist cannot afford to cooperate simply.<br><br>

#### <b>First strike on the Soviets</b>

<blockquote>
  <i>If you say 'why not bomb them tomorrow', I say, why not today? If you say 'today at five o'clock', I say why not one o'clock?</i>
</blockquote>(He recanted this a couple of years later.)
<br>

The mistake was twofold: to assume that the Soviets would continue growing, and to assume that the nuclear taboo would not hold. That taboo, that tradition is one of the most precious things in the world, and almost nothing is worth breaking it. To which you reply: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism#Estimated_number_of_victims" rel="nofollow noopener">100 million people</a> are not worth it? To which I can only apologise and suggest that 100 million are not worth 300 million.<br>

#### <br><b>Trusting Klaus Fuchs</b><br>

He actually handed the Soviets a new nuke design through the infamous Fuchs.<br>

#### <br>Nonerror: <b>"Proof" of no hidden variables</b><br>

The conventional view is that von Neumann screwed up his no-hidden-variables proof, claimed to have shown the impossibility of hidden variables, and that this convinced everyone until Bell came along and exposed the error (30 years after Grete Hermann did it and was ignored). But <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0499" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09305.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">misrepresents the proof</a>, which just says that a hidden variables theory will have to have a certain weird structure (which Bohmian mechanics does).<br><br>

#### <b>Targeting Kyoto</b><br>

I don't know if a nuclear strike on Japan was ultimately for the best (considering the appalling toll of the Pacific theatre on both sides, the likely larger toll of taking Honshū, and the second-order effects of showing the world that everything had changed). But that they were <i>civilian</i> strikes seems completely gratuitous. Striking Kyoto, the spiritual centre, in particular seems incredibly high risk.<br><br>

#### Nonerror: <b>The brain is digital</b><br>

People act like he was naive about the brain as computer, but he just wasn’t:<br>
<blockquote>
  <i>the brain can prima facie be considered as a digital computer. However, upon further reflection, some elements of analog computing (e.g., the chemistry) will also become relevant in understanding the functioning of the brain.</i>
</blockquote>
<br>

#### <b>The von Neumann bottleneck</b><br>

The world standard architecture for computers leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture#Von_Neumann_bottleneck" rel="nofollow noopener">a huge waste of CPU cycles</a>, waiting for memory. This wasn't such a big deal in the 50s, but CPU performance has massively outpaced bus bandwidth over the last 70 years.<br><br>

#### <b>Against high-level programming</b><br>

<blockquote>'von Neumann opposed the development of assemblers and high-level language compilers. He preferred to employ legions of human programmers (mostly low-paid graduate students) to hand-assemble code into machine language. “It is a waste of a valuable scientific computing instrument”, von Neumann reportedly said, “to use it to do clerical work.”.'
</blockquote>
<br>

#### <b>Various dumb personal risks</b><br>

He did not live like someone who understood expected utility and hyperbolic discounting. He ate way too much, drove incredibly badly, was an easy mark for salesmen, pissed off his wife by leching. He spent a lot of time travelling to government meetings. He let others profit from his inventions. These imply irrationality - or a surprising lack of interest in his own wealth, longevity, time use, or marriage. <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com/2019/10/26/some-notes-on-von-neumann-as-a-human-being/" rel="nofollow noopener">This post collects other apparently bad decisions.</a>

<div class="accordion">
  <h3>Was von Neumann amoral?</h3>
  <div>
    People tend to identify von Neumann with the cold war he helped arrange. But John Nash, Henry Kissinger, Edward Teller, Wernher von Braun, and Herman Kahn are much more inhuman and irrationally intelligent, and I think these men are what people are really after.
    <br><br>
    Feynman: "John von Neumann gave me an interesting idea: that you don't have to be responsible for the world that you're in. So I have developed a very powerful sense of social irresponsibility as a result of von Neumann's advice. It's made me a very happy man ever since. But it was von Neumann who put the seed in that grew into my active irresponsibility!“<br><br>
    I'm gonna go out on a long limb and say that Feynman straight up misunderstood vN. It's not that you have no responsibility, that you are radically free to indulge your own whims.
<!--  -->
    It's that the world isn't your fault. That the world is too large for you to feel responsible for the whole of it.<br><br>
<!--  -->
    My main evidence for this extraordinary claim is JvN's sustained and frantic service for the world, sustained for decades at great personal cost. You can't read his work on nuclear strategy, or ‘Can We Survive Technology?', or note his open sourcing the vn architecture, or note the cumulative years he spent travelling to DC, without seeing that he took lots of responsibility, as much as he could.<br><br>
    <!--  -->
"Responsible" sure does not mean morally flawless. It means facing the world and trying.<br><br>

It actually doesn't make very much sense to feel remorse for birthing the atomic bomb, once you find yourself in a post-Curie, post-Hahn, post-Szilard world. It's gonna happen eventually; the question is who will get it first?<br><br>

(Yes, in practice their pathetic security and JvN's in particular handed it to Stalin.)<br><br>

(Yes, von Neumann overestimated the transmissibility and stability of communism, leading to an inhuman and absurd strategy which he recanted a couple of years later.)<br><br>

Working for the US government for 30 years is not the action of a capering harlequin.<br><br>

It's easiest to see JvN's moral seriousness in his late writing on x risk and by comparison with the true amoral fucks like Nash and Teller<br><br>

<blockquote>What von Neumann disliked most about Nash’s approach, though, was the axioms upon which it was built. The idea that people might not work together for mutual benefit was anathema to him. He was central European to the core, his intellectual outlook shaped by a milieu where ideas were debated and shaped over coffee and wine. At that very moment, he was busily pushing as much as he could about the technical details of his computing project into the public domain. Ruling out communication ran counter to the spirit of his ‘coalitional’ conception of game theory. Even the fact that Nash’s solution could produce a point-solution to a complex game struck von Neumann as unrealistic. He maintained the theory could provide only a spectrum of solutions, with the actual result determined by social mores and the specific circumstances at the time...<br><br>

‘I was playing a non-cooperative game in relation to von Neumann rather than simply seeking to join his coalition’... <br><br>

arch-rationalist von Neumann had presupposed that even the hard-boiled players he envisaged would collaborate for common advantage. By contrast, Nash would himself describe his thinking, in retrospect, as more individualistic, more ‘American’. It is arguably Nash’s conception of game theory, not von Neumann’s, that more closely embodies the kill-or-be-killed paranoia of the early Cold War. And it would be Nash’s powerful solution to games that would for the first few decades after the Second World War take academia, economics and RAND by storm.<br><br>

With two equally valid solutions to choose from, Nash or von Neumann-Morgenstern, the question was which would real humans plump for?... they leaned towards the von Neumann-Morgenstern solution of mutual cooperation.

We need clown geniuses like Ricky F and we need quiet backroom geniuses like Jason Metheny and we need human calculators like JvN. (I'm not sure if we need psycho fucks like Nash, except that we find ourselves in a world which already has psycho fucks to counter.)
<br><br>
<!--  -->
    <!--  -->
    His waking nightmare can be read as supporting this:<br><br>
    <blockquote>
      ‘What we are creating now,’ [JvN] told her, 'is a monster whose influence is going to change history, provided there is any history left, yet it would be impossible not to see it through, not only for the military reasons, but it would also be unethical from the point of view of the scientists not to do what they know is feasible, no matter what terrible consequences it may have. And this is only the beginning! The energy source which is now being made available will make scientists the most hated and also the most wanted citizens of any country.'
<!--  -->
      But then von Neumann abruptly switched from talking about the power of the atom to the power of machines that he thought were ‘going to become not only more important but indispensable’.
      “We will be able to go into space way beyond the moon if only people could keep pace with what they create,’ he said. And he worried that if we did not, those same machines could be more dangerous than the bombs he was helping to build.”
    </blockquote>
  This seems to assert nonconsequentialism - science for science's sake, some idiotic idea of it being "unethical" to not build what can be built - but it makes more sense as saying the decision to build the bomb is counterfactually inert: terrible consequences are coming no matter what.
