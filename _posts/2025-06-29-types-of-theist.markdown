I'm a fourth-generation atheist.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a> That's one reason I completely failed to understand religion until I was 20, when I visited the [Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral) randomly. It's a cruel structure, giant spikes on top and dimly-lit brass torture inside. Random stained glass often not depicting anything. It's my favourite church; it is honest about housing a death cult; it captures a neglected part of the essence of Christ: being [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_metal).

But there in the foyer of the great hell hall was... a nice stall run by the Liverpool Catholic Women's League, selling homemade jam and so on. Staffed by the kind of stout lady I recognized from Women's Institute coffee mornings and that one friend's grandmother.

How, I wondered, do such ladies persist with domesticity and normality when _surrounded by_ this uberbrutalist Vatican II architecture? 

Never mind that: how did they ever persist with the horror and vertigo and absurdity of their post-Semitic Platonist egalitarian spandrel in _any_ church? 

I realised that they manage by compartmentalisation; inherited <a href="{{lw}}">memetic immunity</a>. That we tortured god to death is not _really_ thought about - many don't know the fundamental dogmas - reading the bible seems fairly rare. Instead, in the foreground is chitchat, coffee, charity, and plodding, safe Victorian hymns. The blood does not mean blood to them, whatever the catechism has them say. It's a social scene, a life-structure, and a comfort first, not necessarily a propositional creed. The varieties of religious nonexperience. <a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6">6</a>

So not really theism. Previously, I had been reducing religion to theism, and theism to philosophical theism, and, often, philosophical theism to fideism or fundamentalism or supernaturalism and redneck jihadism.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7">7</a>

<br>

(I was, at 20, just wise enough to catch myself before I made an equal and opposite error, that of ignoring theism; I could easily have reduced religion to nonpropositional coreligionism. But no: there are the community theists and the philosophical theists I knew from the debates.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a> Obviously these are <a href="{{ideal}}">ideal types</a> and many people are some of both.)



A third category are the _political_ theists: think Thiel and Vance and <a href="{{ali}}">Hirsi Ali</a>.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8">8</a> They see religion as a necessary corrective to man's dark nature, who fear conservatism rampaging without empathy and principles like those religion was supposed to instill; the ones who believe faith is salutary whether or not they have it themselves; and separately also the ones using the community theists as a ladder.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>

So: the coreligionists, the theologians, and the politicos.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>

It took me another 10 years to examine atheism with similar deflationary clarity. What are our equivalent ideal types?

* _Philosophical atheism_: the kind you know. Debunking and denouncing, Dawkins and Hitchens, Reddit and LessWrong. We adore the oldies - , Hume and d'Holbach, Shelley - so brave, they were so original, they sacrificed so much - but the new ones <a href="{{ssc}}">fell</a>, partly because of their weakmanning, partly because sincerity became cringe, partly because the American religious right lost some of its supremacy and cohesion making organised atheism less urgent, partly because the grotesques of the war on terror made the Left want to defend Muslims.

* _Social atheism_: there are some tiny explicitly atheist scenes - Humanists, Assembly but the real manifestation of this is implicit: just fitting-in into intellectual (i.e. liberal) culture. Avoiding seeming cringe by being too sincere or too metaphysical or too grand narrative, or else living out <a href="{{deathcab}}">your trauma</a> from being forced to attend religious stuff as a child. Also Reddit.<br><br>There is a taboo in e.g. British public and professional life about bringing it up.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9">9</a> In Estonia proselytizing on the doorstep is seen as not just annoying but offensively invasive, an abuse of politeness and privacy and autonomy.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a> I claim that the social justice wave of the eC21st was neither capital-R-religious nor atheistic (it mutated until it could move any host), but it certainly occupied the space that social atheism could have.

* _Political atheist_: Again, this would mean believing it is good to not be religious. The Communists were this: religion as the opiate of the masses, which they were best served going cold turkey off, so that the pain of life would agitate and mobilise them. Hard to think of many current examples, partly because the evidence is mildly against instrumental atheism, and atheists feel compelled to pay more lip service to evidence (since what else can they rest upon?). Clearly this is different in China.


<br>

The above very basic understanding helps me put up with religion, which is good because it means I have more friends / am less of a dickhead. But it's not unqualified. I still believe theism is a mistake; lightly immoral like littering; a damn shame in an intelligent being; and to be tolerated rather than approved-of. 

<!-- (It's also dishonest to exploit it for feels or cheap political gain, as some modern chuds do.)  -->

But I appreciate each of the three types, construed as a common way to be nice, thoughtful, or prudent. Go forth and chill.

    	At least; I don't know much about my great-great-grandparents. But my anticlerical great-grandather was already an anomaly in the rural Highlands of the 1910s, so probably just 4th. He was a farmer and a socialist. He didn't pass on much to his lineage - they're not readers like him - except contempt for the presumptuous, self-superior clergymen and their nonsensical books. We never met, and my life isn't about my family, but I feel very close to him.

		In his stridency, interest in propositional content and propositional logic, tolerance for galaxy-brain shit, love of attention, and unwillingness to just shrug and let others be wrong, I would guess that William Lane Craig is psychologically more like me than he is like most Christians.

		I'm bracketing out Theocrats and Pascalists.

		I recognise that I'm most of all describing British Christianity here - and that other places retain the wild zealotry and wailing and seizures and madness of crowds. But we had that here once, and how we suffered it, and how we made others suffer it.

		I remain sympathetic to the philosophers on one point: calling yourself a Christian without understanding the claims that {Jesus is Lord, the Trinity is one, you have original sin, etc} and agreeing with these claims is kinda crap. So I'm a sort of Jesuit.
