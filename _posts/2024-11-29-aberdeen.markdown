In Aberdeen there are a handful of days a year where after the rain the sun comes out and the wet granite's trillion mica crystals all shine and you sit there in a giant bowl of light squinting. You can't really drive properly at that moment. It is enough light to make you think briefly that it makes up for the grey darkness the entire rest of the year.

I lived in Tillydrone for 2 years and got attacked on the street 3 times. Punched in the face for smiling. Bottle shattered next to me. In fairness I was wearing a stupid hat.

Glimmer of Cold Brine


Mica glittered from the white stone.
Town of the pure crystal,
I learnt Latin in your sparkling cage,
I loved your brilliant streets.

Places that have been good to us we love.
The rest we are resigned to.
The fishermen hung shining in their yellow
among university bells.
