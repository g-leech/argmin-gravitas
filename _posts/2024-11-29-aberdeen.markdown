There are a handful of days a year where, immediately after the rain, the sun comes out, and the wet granite, the trillion mica crystals, all light up, and you sit in a bowl of sun.

I lived in Tillydrone for 2 years and got attacked 3 times. Punched in the face for smiling. Bottle shattered next to me. In fairness I was wearing a stupid hat.

Glimmer of Cold Brine


Mica glittered from the white stone.
Town of the pure crystal,
I learnt Latin in your sparkling cage,
I loved your brilliant streets.

Places that have been good to us we love.
The rest we are resigned to.
The fishermen hung shining in their yellow
among university bells.
