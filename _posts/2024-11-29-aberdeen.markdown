On a handful of days a year in Aberdeen when the sun comes out after the rain and ten billion crystals of wet quartz and mica in the clean fraction of the granite are allowed to shine you sit there in an ocean of light way brighter than the sea. You squint (you don't own sunglasses) - you can't really drive. A giant mirror, shrouded all year, alight. As if it's a year's worth in one day - enough to make you think it makes up for the grey the rest of the time, "you're even." You are not.

<br>

* It's hard north: a bit further up than Moscow. Provincial among provinces; the end of the world. ("_We are the last people on earth. There are no lands beyond us._")
    * I'm from even further north, so the greyness and cold didn't shock me. But be ready for 3pm dusk in December. I was constantly slightly cold as a lad; I got a lot better at saxophone when I moved south because my fingers got enough blood. 
    * Average temperature is 8°C. That's not that cold! But between the rain, wind, fog, and greyness it feels colder than say Inverness. (It supposedly rains less here than in the rest of Scotland, but 1) it's still 1/3 of all days, 2) it's freezing.)
        * In the past, 33°C was a once-per-century event.
    * The entire month of December gets ~45 "sunshine hours". i.e. one hour of weak direct sunlight a day, or more often clustered, with days on end without any at all. 
    * Like San Francisco, the sea fog (the "haar") is thick, motile, and common. There's also occasionally huge amounts of sea foam blowing along the streets. Luckily I love fog. About 1/3 of days have some.
    * You're stunned by colourlessness. The sky is bright grey, the buildings are dark grey, the people are pink-grey (97% white). In the weak light the polluted granite resembles breezeblocks more than crystal. [Meades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE6RH7APXfw) thinks that this stark monochrome outlook explains why Aberdeen has an unusual density of tattoo parlours even for a port. I was so used to the sky being flat white-grey that blue skies still thrill me a little.
    <!-- * Our satirist called it "Greyness". -->
    * "_75% of those in Primary 6 and 7 didn't show evidence of low mood_"
    * As a romantic teen I wanted to think that the hostile environment fostered fellow-feeling. Everyone here has a shared enemy (the weather), and everyone's inside. Trapped.
<br><br>

* North means remote, irrelevant, unstrategic. And so populated by unstrategic people, since strategic ones leave. 
    <!-- * That's a costly signal though. You're  -->
    * So no one finds themselves here by accident. I'm from just along the road, Elgin, and fell into the lowest-energy-basin cos they gave me a scholarship on top of the bursary. 
    * 5 years here; 4 at uni and 1 in a bookshop. I arrived as a <a href="https://ebrary.net/272422/language_literature/scottish_working_classics">cliche</a> self-built rural intellectual: extreme and eristic, grown into an odd shape for want of sun and live conversation. 
    * "_the largest village in the world_"
    * We're late to things. Whaling 1800 (vs 1700), art gallery 1880 (Glasgow 1807), electric light 1894 (London 1878), Uber 2024 (London 2012)

* It's grim but _not_ poor. Per capita GDP is £52k, about the same as Glasgow or Anchorage or Miami; a third higher than UK average. 
    <!-- * The ominously named Cults is in the top 50 most expensive postcodes in the country.  -->
    * AB15 is the postcode with the most millionaires outside London. 
    * During the 2009 financial crisis, Aberdeen was the only UK city beside London to completely avoid recession. It arrived in 2015 instead, when the American shale taps and the OPEC taps opened. Having half of all jobs in one sector ("energy") means it's absurdly cyclical, in lagged concert with global oil prices. Population is down 7% in the last ten years.
    <img src="/img/abdn/ile.png" width="80%" />

* 
    * Yes: just after the Scottish independence referendum, the oil price halved. Would have been carnage.
    * Fracking in America was bad news for Aberdeen. The Ukraine war was, selfishly, good news. Global warming is locally good news; the net-zero carbon commitment is bad news, though they're [trying](https://www.theacornproject.uk/) to get on that wagon.

* North means unmerged: allopatric. [Doric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doric_dialect_(Scotland)) is one of the strongest dialects in Britain. My Estonian girlfriend was here for four years and never got to understanding what the bus drivers were saying. 
    <!-- The "Furry Boots city" after the conventional "Whaur aboots are ye fae?" -->
    * The name means 'primitive': "_Since the Dorians were regarded as uncivilised by the Athenians, "Doric" came to mean "rustic" in English, and was applied particularly to the language of Northumbria and the Lowlands of Scotland and also to the simplest of the three orders in architecture._"
    * The Spartans were Dorians, and so too Victorian England had an [interesting way](https://dc.etsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4627&context=etd) of forgiving Scotland for the '45, by racialising Highlanders:
    "_the [Jacobite] rebellions were increasingly understood, not as an act of betrayal, but natural coming from a martial race. In this context, war was the only way Scots knew how to demonstrate their grievances._"
    * It's dangerous to use any contemporary thing (uncontacted tribes, anemones, remote languages) as evidence of the ancient past but hey Doric _is_ more similar to Middle Scots and so Middle English than any extant dialect ([besides Frisian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZY7iF4Wc9I)).
    * The words for sex are terrible. "Cowp" "tip" "dip" "rummle" "pummel" "hole" "chug" "ride" "pump" <!-- "tup" swive dicht -->
    * It's in decline under the usual tv-internet Americanisation. I only ever met one man who spoke like [Johnny Gibb](https://www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk/cmsw/document/?documentid=128) in my life: my granda's mate A'thur

Whenever I have occasion to classify the persons I meet into three classes, "good, medium, bad," I use a needle mounted as a pricker, wherewith to prick holes, unseen, in a piece of paper... classifying the girls I passed in streets or elsewhere as attractive, indifferent, or repellent. Of course this was a purely individual estimate, but it was consistent, judging from the conformity of different attempts in the same population.

<blockquote style="padding-bottom: 0pt;">There were many classes of persons whom former generations of fishermen tried to avoid when going to their boats. In some places, cripples were feared. Anybody with red hair or flat feet might bring bad luck if encountered, but this could always be averted if the fisherman spoke first. Why certain proper names should be capable of doing harm is a mystery, but such was the firm conviction of many a Moray Firth fisherman in the past. ‘Ross’ was a name particularly feared... The Cullen fishermen believed that ‘Anderson’ and ‘Duffus’ were dangerous words to mention at sea. </blockquote>

* Because it is north, we don't know much about the past. The Beakies and Picts and Taexali left no words and not much cargo. What we know we read off the blood they left. <br><br>Short version: we presume paleolithic [Hamburgians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_culture) lived among the glaciers and that their traces were ground into nothing by glacial motion. The mesolithic [calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Field) people then presumably smashed the Hamburgians. "[Western Hunter-Gatherers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_hunter-gatherer)" (from Ukraine-Kazakh-Scythia) came and maybe smashed the calendar people. Then the [EEFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_European_Farmers) (farmers from Anatolia via Spain) came and smashed them. The [Beakies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5973796/#F2) (steppe herders) came and smashed the EEFs. The Picts (Irish) came and smashed the Beakies. The Romans smashed them and left. Some non-Pict Britons came and smashed them. The Vikings smashed the Britons and left. The Christians (Gaels) smashed them and merged. The [Normans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_de_Brus,_1st_Lord_of_Annandale) (Vikings) smashed them and merged. The lowlanders smashed them and merged. And then the Texans arrived.

* Unlike for <a href="/glesga">Glasgow</a>, I don't have a unified multi-century theory of Aberdeen. There's not as much to explain and no single variable to advocate. 
    * "Small C21st north European port city" (insular, mercantile, post-post-industrial, grim) maybe captures most of it, plus "oil town" (corporate, young men with more money than sense). 
    * There are three thousand places of this size on Earth. Could you write a theory for each? Yes.

* You want to explain a place, so you reach for their climate and economy. 
    * Everyone-everywhere farmed so it can't explain anything distinctive, so factor out that industry unless there's some interesting variations on crops or animals or communal resource management.
    * Like everywhere, the place was ten times smaller 250 years ago. Most of it is less than 100 years old. Can _anything_ before then explain much now? (More than 10% of what it is now?) Maybe, but I despair of weak evidence like history being in charge of this.

    * The distinctive industries are fish, wool, paper, granite, whaling, shipbuilding, oil. Some whisky tourism. These don't seem very unique, besides the granite, whisky, and oil. But does anywhere on earth have this exact set or a superset?

* The Harbour is the oldest business in Britain. But nothing happens for 250 years after it's founded in 1136: zero population growth. Then it slowly triples to 10,000 people over 300 years to 1700 and, like everywhere else, then things go nuts.
<!-- 1646, a quarter of the population was killed by the plague. -->
* _Change places_. In 1696 they started a bunch of paper mills. Maybe this explains something? Linear development along the rivers rather than concentric. 300 years later Bryson noticed the resulting feeling: 
    <blockquote>In vain I sought a single place where I could stand with hands on hips and say 'Aha, so this is Aberdeen'.</blockquote>
    <!-- Fishwives seasonal. Thousands of Gaels every summer. A female industry. -->

* _Change places_. In 1741 they started working the granite quarries at scale. 
    * Granite is the hardest thing humans currently build out of (besides a little decorative quartzite). There was nothing softer around. The city couldn't exist without spiral rope sawing and later water sawing. 
    * About half of the city center is built from the yield of Rubislaw quarry. We made a 140m hole in the ground to make ourselves out of. 
    <!-- * Besides the huge masonry and transport costs, the price was silicosis and now mild radon risk. -->

* _Change places_. In 1760 they started building ships at scale (10x fewer than Glasgow and probably 50x less by tonnage).

* _Change places_. Building Union Street for a deluxe political celebration literally bankrupted the city in 1817. The [Herring Boom](https://www.scotfishmuseum.org/the-herring-boom.php) immediately propped them up for the next 50 years, a silver rush. <!-- boom towns. -->

<!-- In 1976 they ended diplomatic relations with the UK. 53 British frigates against 7 small Icelandic boats. Hard power was over. -->

* _Change places_. The first north sea oilfield was discovered in 1969; the last granite quarry went to zero in 1971. The last Aberdeen ship was launched in 1990. Paper went to ~zero in 2022. My uncle was one of the last out.

* It seems incredibly lucky that all of these things lined up and didn't completely destroy the place. The oil was discovered just in time! But maybe I'm just conditioning post-treatment; maybe all successful places have such a "lucky" streak of economic resilience by definition.

In December, 1831, nearly three years after William Burke had
been hanged in Edinburgh’s Lawnmarket, children playing near
the Aberdeen Anatomical Theatre watched in horror as a dog,
scraping the ground behind the theatre, hauled out and gnawed a
mangled human limb. The alarm was raised, a crowd gathered,
and other remains were found.
By now the crowd had become a mob. Francis Clerihew
estimated that 10,000 people gathered in Hospital Row that
afternoon. They broke into the theatre and chased the anatomist
and his students from the building. Moir jumped through a window
of his house and escaped through St Nicholas Churchyard.
After Moir and the students had gone, three bodies were found
laid out for dissection. They were taken to Drum’s Aisle in St
Nicholas Church. Meanwhile, the mob smashed everything they
could lay their hands on, even using a strong plank as a battering
ram to undermine the walls and break them down. The building
was ransacked and set on fire and when the Provost and a number
of magistrates appeared on the scene and warned the rioters
against their illegal actions they were ignored... in a deliberate workmanlike and substantial manner
by some forty or fifty active ruffians in the admiring presence of
some 10 or 12,000 spectators and of an unresisting miliary and
constabulary force’.  -->

I've been harsh and bloodless and reductive about the place, to warn you (what I assume about you). I've repeated warnings by professional sneerers (Bryson, Theroux) who did a two-day drive-by and fled after extracting anecdotes for pay, like mosquitoes. But the city was enough for me: anything is a shining city if you're from the sticks.

For the first time in my life I had people who'd read poetry with me. For the first time in my life I had an actual challenge (understrand Debreu, understand Levinas, understand Frege, understand yourself). Aberdeen wasn't much but it was a _scene_, a node. I saw Gil Scott-Heron at the Warehouse two months before he died. I saw the Wave Pictures, still the best guitarist I've ever seen, at Drummond's and The Lemon Tree and Drummond's. I gave them a madeira cake. I saw Jesse Michaels and Mike Park at Drummond's in an audience of twelve. Chris Clavin played my mate Lori's living room.

I felt exactly what Crichton Smith (above) felt, coming from the islands. Anything lights tinder this dry.



## The best of Aberdeen

> As well as producing no political figures of distinction, Aberdeen produced no architect of note in the 20th century, no painters (James McBey talks of the philistinism of Aberdeen and of having to leave the city to get work), and no writers of other than local distinction. Geography made the city a provincial one; its economic development reinforced this isolation, rather than overcoming it.

    * There's a huge black hole between Barbour in 1500 and... ig Charles Murray in 1900. <!--Harry Giles.-->  Ossian is fake but good. Annand Taylor is real but bad. 
    * Byron hated his time in Aberdeen (no disqualification in an Aberdonian) but that was partly because he was being actively molested at the time.

* **Philosopher**: [Alexander Bain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bain_(philosopher)) made modern philosophy of mind out of severe mess. <!-- * People always name Thomas Reid for Aberdeen but he's an intemperate wee bastard. More recently Crispin Wright, Guido Bacciagaluppi, Luca Moretti. Supposedly Kant's granddad as well. -->

* **Scientist**: [Patrick Manson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Manson) investigated one of the most important questions in all of medicine: how to stop mosquitoes from ruining everything? And thereby founded the field of tropical medicine.

* **Evildoer**: An Aberdeen city baillie, William Fordyce, sold 600 children into American slavery.

They had it burned in the mercat and forced him to recant.
