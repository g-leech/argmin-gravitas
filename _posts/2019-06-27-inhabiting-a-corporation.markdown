You find yourself inside a machine the size of a city. It is slow, powerful, <a href="{{age}}">theoretically</a> <a href="{{immort}}">immortal</a>, and contains thousands of cogs and hard-wired operators and inexplicably sealed bulkheads. It's warm and well-watered. You could die in here.

Which is to say that I worked a pleasant job at a multinational insurance corporation for 3 years. It wasn't dreary, possibly because I was in the "data science" bit, the bit allowed to do new things without strangulating oversight and backwards-compatibility.

They're good jobs, as jobs go. Extremely flexible hours, challenging nonroutine tasks, unlimited remote work, very good pay per hour, massive amounts of autonomy (relative to managed manual work), friendly smart colleagues. And what Zed Shaw <a href="{{zed}}">says</a> about programming in nontech companies was true here -

> Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food joint. You're much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession. People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.

<br>
Many people's relation to their employer is that of a servant in the household of the firm. But service is only tenable if you're aligned with your patron. A lot of people are incapable of being paid to care about things. They cannot settle for indirect fulfilment, indirect passion, indirect goods. I was one once; if you had told me ten years ago that I would happily spend my time in such a place, I would have been horrified: I was a full-on acolyte of <a href="{{bakan}}">Bakan</a>, <a href="{{klein}}">Klein</a>, <a href="{{chomsky}}">Chomsky</a>, who attribute most of the world's ills to corporations (or rather to The System which corporations are thought to control). 

It's easy to see the <a href="{{watch}}">pathologies</a> and <a href="{{felon}}">harms</a> of corporations. The benefits of these unsympathetic machines is hard to see without data. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>

### 1 in 100,000

In a sense there's nothing new or weird about being in such a large organisation. After all, I'm "in" a loose organisation of 66m people, Britain, and similarly I am 1 in the 508m of the EU. (For now.) <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>

<a href="{{rao}}">Venkatesh Rao thinks</a> _all_ firms are dysfunctional, their quality utterly unstable, their size a _measure_ of their decay:

> organizations don’t suffer pathologies; they are intrinsically pathological constructs.  Idealized organizations are not perfect. They are perfectly pathological.  So while most most management literature is about striving relentlessly towards an ideal by executing organization theories completely, this school would recommend that you do the bare minimum organizing to prevent chaos, and then stop... It may be horrible, but like democracy, it is the best you can do.
<br><br>Today, any time an organization grows too brittle, bureaucratic and disconnected from reality, it is simply killed, torn apart and cannibalized, rather than reformed. A Sociopath with an idea recruits just enough Losers to kick off the cycle. As it grows it requires a Clueless layer to turn it into a controlled reaction rather than a runaway explosion. Eventually, as value hits diminishing returns, both the Sociopaths and Losers make their exits, and the Clueless start to dominate. Finally, the hollow brittle shell collapses on itself and anything of value is recycled by the sociopaths according to meta-firm logic.


This cynicism is frightfully exciting and flatters your taste and mine. It fits the great romance of the age, the startup. But how to reconcile it with the economic consensus (cf. <a href="{{baum}}">Baumol</a> and <a href="{{cowen}}">Cowen</a>) that big firms are good, incredibly good, for the people who use their stuff and the governments who manage to tax them? I suppose we have to infer that the mess inside can't stop humans from doing productive things.

It's not just the number of people that makes an organisation unmanageable. The firm's internal software landscape is a comparably vast overhead. I don't think any single person, or any 20 people, really understands the hundreds of legacy systems our team relied on.

### The Bureaucratic Universe

<a href="{{grae}}">David Graeber says a lot of false things</a>. But I still read him because, in between those, he says large true things. For instance, he was the first person I heard pointing out one of the largest facts about the world: capitalism, communism and the mixed economy are all founded on the same social structure, the bureaucracy. (HR are the obvious private example, being a rigid impersonal force with great legal power over individuals.)

A standard Left metaphor for a corporation is a shark: a highly optimised and optimising creature which destroys all other human value in the pursuit of profit. Anyone who has spent much time in a large corp will laugh and laugh at this depiction, remembering the 5 hour meetings, compulsory useless training weeks, the constant duplication of effort, in short the rigid and unprofitable bureaucracy... 

That said, we shouldn't equivocate between state and private bureacracies, as the anarchists do. State bureaucracy is nastier, more threatening, extracts more.

* I just applied for a council tax reduction, since I'll be unemployed for a while. The council asked me roughly 200 questions, including half a dozen ID numbers, and so took an hour and a half of my life. They asked when my partner last entered the country. They asked how long we've been together. Paperwork is a regressive tax on the stressed and the poor, and it should be disincentivised, treated as paid labour. _No_ bureaucratic task at BigCorp took this long, except the initial interviews.

* When I was (briefly) in the civil service my blog posts were scrutinised quite closely. No one ever gave a shit in BigCorp.

* To be less petty: consider how many people the state (including the most powerful bureacracy of all, our military) kills, relative to corporations. (You might try and count say pollution deaths on the corporate side, but that's a mistake - command economies were in general <a href="{{pollute}}">even more polluting</a>.)

### The City and the City

* The <a href="{{city}}">Square Mile</a> is a pretty, storied place - though it smells. The low-key stink around the central City is due to its ancient drains having to handle about 1000 times more people than they were built to, and its tall buildings boxing narrow streets, preventing ventilation. A lazy novelist could use this to connote moral corruption, but there you go.

* I wish I could say that being surrounded by beautiful buildings - nigh unto greatness - had a sustained effect on my character or even my mood but I'm afraid it didn't. Aesthetics is a <a href="{{mill}}">treadmill</a>.

* The classic image of a <a href="{{boy}}">Cityboy</a> is wrong: real conformist / careerists wear a surprisingly bright blue suit.

### Insurance: the tedious thrill



* I kept a volume of <a href="{{kafka}}">Kafka</a> on my desk at all times.

* One of the nice things about insurance is that the companies' interests are much more aligned with yours, the policyholder's, than usual in capitalism. If you become safer (after paying them the premium) they make more money. There are a _few_ products that follow this gradient - flood detection gizmos for your pipes, discounts for doing exercise and quitting smoking, and so on. But not that many. <a href="{{wright}}">See here</a> for why insurers don't do more risk mitigation.

* Related: The firm had an "emerging risks" research department, quite forward-thinking, doing epidemic modelling and future climate shocks. But the health insurance people concede that pandemic modelling is useless - since the claimants die before they can claim for health. (The life insurance people model it.)

* You pay an insurer to hold your risk for you. There is a sense in which a large house insurer "owns" millions of glass windows, millions of water pipes. (But only about 50% of profits are your payments; the other half come from investing your premiums.)

* Even though it's a financial company, in the financial heart of the world, making half its money off capital gains, it's not the same as the big guns. Some posh products like paid bank accounts have two categories for financial industry companies: "Finance I" (hedgies, quants, some brokers) and "Finance II" (deposit bankers, insurers, analysts). So ordinary people on ordinary London professional pay. I only called myself a '<a href="{{boy}}">Cityboy</a>' when I wanted to shock pious refuseniks.

* Two <a href="{{ogden}}">regulatory</a> <a href="{{brex}}">changes</a> caused an astonishing amount of frantic work: tens of thousands of extra hours. One of these was a stroke of a pen.

* Only 1% of the staff were actuaries, doing the distinctive work of the industry. The business-school notion of a "profit centre" (the part that makes the money) is spurious and nasty, but it's extremely useful if you're a rent-seeker looking for unearned rewards. Or an anthropologist seeking how people in organisations actually think. (<a href="{{drucker}}">The inventor</a> of the notion calls it "_One of the biggest mistakes I have made_".)

* What is The Actuarial Problem? <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>
    * First, pass each customer through a boolean function of handcrafted rejection rules. 
    * If they survive, predict their expected loss. A stochastic model with a heavily skewed non-negative response distribution, with a multiplicative structure.
    * _Pricing constraints_: pro-rata (price per time); add some hand coded loadings and discounts (e.g. "expected loss should increase with the sum insured"); enforce monotonicity to prevent customer outrage; similarly, enforce only small changes on previous pricing for each customer.
    * _Regulatory constraints_: remove all explicit factors relating to <a href="{{protected}}">protected classes</a> and vet factors for strong correlations with them; model explanation; known relationships between risk and risk factors.
    * A pair of GLMs modelling the "severity" (loss amount conditional on claim) and "frequency" (claim probability) handle all this quite well, but boosted trees are edging them out after thirty years.
    * Break the loss into "perils" (categories of risk like injury, third-party liability, accident). Build one pair of GLMs per peril, and sum the products of these to get the per-customer estimated cost.
    * There's also fraud and "rate raiding" detection.
        
<!-- Gamma distribution: expected variance increases with the square of the expected value
    Prevents overfitting to large vals
    more tolerance of deviations of the observed from expected value if expected value is high.
 -->

* "<a href="{{umesh}}">If you get a raise every year, they're not paying you enough</a>."

* There is a chasm between the builders and the operators of algorithms / mathematical methods. Library maintainers vs library callers. (It isn't as simple as academics vs private sector - every functioning company will have a few builders, since no algo is so general that it works well without local knowledge.) Actuaries are mostly operators.

* How BigCorp handles its own financial risk was pretty impressive: an enormous apparatus for internal retrocession, central holdings, international arbitrage of capital requirements (i.e. holding money in nearby countries to minimise the impact of regulations).

* You could use an insurer's 'loss ratio' (payouts / revenue) as a fairness estimate. 50% is an even split between the two parties. 90% is more usual in UK personal insurance.

### Outsourcing

About half the team were in India. 

The classic case against globalisation has two components

1. _Welfare_: "Western companies hiring in the developing world have unacceptable working conditions."
2. _Fairness_: "Western companies hiring in the developing world pay much less for the exact same work."

The first is often true (though even sweatshops are often average by local standards) but wasn't at BigCorp.

The second is true by definition - the companies simply wouldn't outsource if it wasn't. In the case of entry-level actuaries it's about "4 lakh rupees" (£5k) vs £32k in the UK. I occasionally talked to Indian colleagues about this (over drinks, out of management's earshot), and they were always pragmatic about it - "better this than no outsourcing and no job". I don't know whether they should be less pragmatic.

<br>

### Abuse of terminology

{%  include corp/jargon.html %}


* Every new thing gets called "AI". Except anything invented before the 90s is not AI, even if it is a statistical learning method like the other things you call AI. GLMs are not AI. <a href="{{rpa}}">RPA</a> is AI.

* My company's name was intentionally selected to mean nothing in any language. This is a _great_ metonym.

* About half of job titles were inflated. The most common was reskinning your Actuarial Analyst job as a Data Scientist job. As far as I know no-one was ever called on this, and references rarely corrected it.

* You may have noticed that in modern business, everything is 'award-winning'. This is due to the incredible array of trade magazines and their trade awards. A charade of ladders. A veneer.

<br>

<br>

### Corporate 'AI'

* The outlook is not good: <a href="{{gardner}}">probably most</a> corporate data science projects fail. The defeaters vary a lot, but inflated expectations, legacy system hell, <a href="{{gigo}}">GIGO</a>, and a weak engineering base are usually implicated.

* The stages of data science are

1. Build pipeline and dashboards
(1b. Get important people to pay attention to them)
2. Build predictions
(2b. Get important people to pay attention to them)
3. Build decision system
(3b. Build good decision system; 
3c. Actually use decision system)

I think almost every DS department in the world is stuck on 1b. We got to (3) in my tenure, starting from nowhere.

### The normalisation of deviance

A bureaucracy has great power to obfuscate and punish obvious infractions, but is much too weak to regulate the larger part of work: minor and gradually escalating deviance. Unwritten rules beat written procedure. One of the nastiest pathologies of teamwork is the "normalisation of deviance", the tendency for work norms to mutate into lazy and harmful forms via <a href="{{proof}}">social proof</a>.

If a piece of wrongness goes unchallenged the first couple of times, it becomes invisible, it suddenly looks right because everyone else is doing it. Say you go outside your spec - but then nothing bad happens, so then we go <a href="{{challenger}}">a little further</a> beyond the spec...

(Just one example from BigCorp: no-one knew how to Procure a GPU through the Procurement platform, so we did weeks of deep learning on CPUs. In 2017.)

<a href="{{foone}}">Foone Turing</a>:

> My point with this is not to say “HEY PEOPLE STOP BENDING THE RULES,” exactly. It’s that you have to consider normalization of deviance when designing systems: **How will these rules interact with how people naturally bend the rules?**

> Disasters aren’t caused by one small event: it’s an avalanche of problems that we survived up until now until they all happen at once. People don't automatically know what should be normal, and when new people are onboarded, they can just as easily learn deviant processes that have become normalized as reasonable processes...

<a href="{{luu}}">Dan Luu</a>:

> people get promoted for heroism and putting out fires, not for preventing fires; and people get promoted for shipping features, not for doing critical maintenance work and bug fixing. 

<a href="{{health}}">To prevent your culture</a> from lulling you into insane behaviour:

> 1. Pay attention to weak signals 
2. Resist the urge to be unreasonably optimistic 
3. Teach employees how to conduct emotionally uncomfortable conversations 
4. System operators need to feel safe in speaking up 
5. Realize that oversight and monitoring are never-ending

### Competence

> "You're technical, aren't you?"

> "Eh, kinda"

> "What do you do?"

> "I'm a data scientist."

> "Well then of course you're technical!"

> "Eh. When I played saxophone I always compared myself to Coltrane and Parker; when I do tech I have in mind Feynman, Tukey, Turing, Gwern."

### Has it changed me?
    

* When I started, I had a fairly unhealthy, cliched idea of what "real work" constituted - meetings, and presentations, and team retreat days were certainly not included in it. 

* Pragmatism. Originally, being pushed into a pseudoscientific self-development course was a major upset. Now compartmentalise.

### Hiring


<center>
    <blockquote>The goal of the future is full unemployment!</blockquote>
    - <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/11/11/goal/">Arthur C Clarke</a>
</center><br>


I ran my first hiring round here, and a dozen more after that. It's _incredibly_ hard, even when you have objective standards like code quality or ML performance to rely on. Pretty much all easily obtained evidence is a <a href="{{performance}}">really weak signal</a> about the candidate's actual performance in the job. I won't complain about having to do homework for jobs again: turns out it's scary and hopeless being on the other side of the table too.

I enforced a standardised test on our hiring, with a consistent numerical marking rubric. And we got blinding of applicants put in. We set applicants a basic supervised learning problem. About one in eight answered it adequately. Total obvious plagiarism was very common, maybe one in six. PhDs did no better than Bachelors. Very few had a Github or similar code host, a very cheap way to show me that you're curious / knowledgeable / whatever.

<br>

### The deviance of turnover 

I was surprised by how much fuckery there was from colleagues at the end of their tenure. People who make it into these places tend to be _very_ good at regulating themselves, tend to be agreeable and compliant. In three years I remember exactly one raised voice, and one instance of silent fury. 

But turnover was high, 30% per year <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>, and this was when you saw normal human deviance. Out of perhaps 30 leavers, we had 

* 2 people put on '<a href="{{garden}}">garden leave</a>' (paid to go away);
* 2 people not really showing up during their notice period;
* 2 people openly watching TV at their desk / playing with <a href="{{mujo}}">MuJoCo</a> completely unrelated to work.

<br>

The other notable antisocial moment was the honesty box. A fridge of snacks was installed, with a price list and honesty box for payment. Every week it came in £40 (~50%) under its sale balance, so they took it out.

<br>

<br>


So if many corporations have net positive effects, if the work is ok and the culture friendly, and if you can easily <a href="{{e2g}}">redirect</a> your excessive remuneration to what actually matters - why stop?

In my case it was because I tried out <a href="{{direct}}">direct do-gooding work</a> and found that I was pretty capable, and that there's a great need for more than money.

It also stomped the importance of environment into me. You _can't_ do great work if you don't actually care. It's hard to respect yourself if you don't respect what you're doing. And you assume the form of your colleagues to a shocking degree. <a href="{{blow}}">This can lead</a> to a slow, subclinical, and ultra-privileged kind of <a href="{{bore}}">burnout</a>:

> I just didn't think my work was very important. I would be very depressed on projects, make slow progress, at times get into a mode where I was much of the time pretending progress simply because I could not bring myself to do the work. I just didn't have the spirit to do it... 

> Over time I got depressed about this: Do I have a terrible work ethic? Am I really just a bad programmer? A bad person? But these questions were not so verbalized or intellectualized, they were just more like an ambient malaise and a disappointment in where life was 

(It's easy to shout <a href="{{marx}}">Marx bingo</a> when you read this kind of thing, and it's not wrong. But that's Marxism: decent negative critique and no practical positive change. It's hard to see how we could have an unalienated society - without much better technology to act as our drudges, anyway. Certainly no actually-existing socialism managed it, and most seem to have made it worse.)

If, once you're financially secure and ensconced in a house and a family, you have no further ambitions, then these places are as good as it gets.
