<blockquote>
	...a life is like iron. If you make good use of it, it wears out; if you don't, rust destroys it. So too we see men worn out by toil; but sluggishness and torpor would hurt them more.
</blockquote>
<center>&#8211; Cato the Elder</center>
<br><br>

<blockquote>
Time spent away from the Iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind... There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it’s impossible to turn back.

The Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you’re a god or a total bastard... The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver. Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds.

The first paragraph of this fitness book has stronger writing than you'd ever expect:

<blockquote>
  Physical strength is the most important thing in life. This is true whether we want it to be or not... Whereas previously our physical strength determined how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed, it now merely determines how well we function in these new surroundings we have crafted for ourselves as our culture has accumulated. But we are still animals – our physical existence is, in the final analysis, the only one that actually matters. A weak man is not as happy as that same man would be if he were strong. This reality is offensive to some people who would like the intellectual or spiritual to take precedence. It is instructive to see what happens to these very people as their squat strength goes up.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
It begins with a metaphilosophical salvo(!) 

This message is repulsive, unjust, and almost exactly fits my experience. (Though he's being imprecise: better to say "the most important <i>foundation</i>", that fitness is a key instrument rather than the highest terminus. Though even then it's not "most important", since it neglects even larger nonintellectual effects on my philosophy of life: love, and <a href="https://www.gleech.org/x-for-all">grand moral scheming</a>.) <br><br>

There is lots of reasoning from first principles, which is satisfying and gives it an Athenian air, but which I can just barely evaluate. Luckily it is just so easy to check if he's right (for your case).<br><br>

<blockquote>
  <i>The force of gravity acting on the bar is always acting straight down in a vertical line. Therefore, the most efficient way to oppose this force is by acting on it vertically as well. So not only is a straight line the shortest distance between two points, but a straight vertical line is also the most efficient bar path for a barbell moving through space in a gravitational framework.</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <i>Your bench press strength doesn’t adapt to the total number of times you’ve been to the gym to bench or to your sincerest hope that it will get stronger. It adapts to the stress imposed on it by the work done with the barbell. Furthermore, it adapts to exactly the kind of stress imposed on it. If you do sets of 20, you get good at doing 20s. If you do heavy singles, you get better at doing those.</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <i>“good technique” in barbell training is easily and understandably defined as the ability of the lifter to keep the bar vertically aligned with the balance point.</i>
</blockquote><br>

Rippetoe is the source of the recent renaissance in cheap simple barbells (free weights, i.e. dozens of muscles recruited at once) over circuits of giant single-muscle machines. (In the West, anyway; large parts of the world, e.g. Russia, apparently never gave up their bars.) He tells a plausible mean story about the perverse economic incentives that led to the latter, 1980-2010.<br><br>

There is too much detail here - he discusses variants of the movements and the debate over them. But what a trivial criticism that is! I think most people could skip two-thirds of the book, since there's detailed kinematics for each move, instructor tips and gym-building tips, but it's interesting throughout. You could get the key parts from the final Programme section, then the "what not to do" chapter closing sheets. Warm-up sets chapter was very useful.<br>

<blockquote>
  <i>if your schedule does not allow time for proper warm-up, it does not allow time for training at all... [The squat] should be carefully and thoroughly prepared with a couple of empty-bar sets, and then as many as five sets between those and the work sets.</i>
</blockquote>There's an abrupt shift in tone, in the chapter on lifting for kids: he starts citing University press books and listing comparative numbers for his claims. So this is a crusade for him.<br><br>It is unlikely that you'd learn form from this alone, even like reading it and applying it live with a mirror. It is unlikely that you could find a PT with this much physical knowledge or clarity.<br><br>He's quite bitchy, which I like but you might not:<br>

<blockquote>
  <i>if you continually miss workouts, you are not actually training, and your obviously valuable time should be spent more productively elsewhere.</i>
</blockquote>

If you're not increasing your max weight lifted, you're not training, and so not following his programme. The obsession with increase is still not mine. Strength, yes, exertion yes, but constant expansion? I aim for 100kg squat, and expect to attain it this year. <i>Not</i> herniating weight, not kneecapping weight, not sclerotic weight: nice big weight. Maybe once I get there I will grow bored, will again be confounded by the power of concrete body on worldview, and have to start climbing again. He thinks everyone gets injured eventually. But is this under the permanent revolution programme?

[Since writing this I looked quite hard and couldn't find any evidence that injury rates increase with (slowly attained) weight, until you get to the crazy competition levels.]
<br><br>

<blockquote>
 	Ambition is useful, greed is not. Most of human history and the science of economics demonstrate that the desire for more than is currently possessed drives improvement, both personally and for societies. But greed is an ugly thing when uncontrolled and untempered with wisdom, and it will result in your progress coming to an ass-grinding halt.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	If you’re a little fluffy around the belly, you have obviously already created the conditions necessary for growth. You’ll usually start out stronger than the skinny guy, and because your body hasn’t got the problems with growing that skinny guys do, strength gains can come more easily for you if you eat correctly.
</blockquote>

I've been doing a derivative of this program since October last year: no trainer, lots of missed sessions, just the primary exercises, 1 hour and out, a scaled-up ordinary diet, and I still saw decent gains, +50kg onto my initial squat. Rippetoe claims this could be achieved in half the time with many gallons of milk and much more aggro, and I see no reason to doubt him.

## Philosophical aspects of lifting

> What sort of philosophy one chooses depends... on what sort of man one is; for a philosophical system is not a dead piece of furniture that we can reject or accept as we wish; it is rather a thing animated by the soul of the person who holds it.

<center> ― Fichte </center><br>

> Gradually it becomes clear to me what every great philosophy really was  – namely the confession of its originator, and a sort of involuntary and unconscious autobiography...

<center> ― Nietzsche </center><br>


* As above: The body helps determine the mind. You should be wary of your own philosophy, not just because of your local social conditioning, but also because of <a href="{{mac}}">your diet</a>, your habits, your daily kindness, and your bench. The lifter is Sisyphus, happy.<br><br>

* Weights are a strong psychological intervention, perhaps the third-strongest I have found, after love and higher purpose. It's comical, how much of my deep teenage unhappiness, and sincere existentialism, was grounded in concrete fixable problems, and how little I understood that they were both fixable and not in fact intellectually grounded. Not knowing how to talk to girls, not exercising, not actively helping people: <a href="{{factory}}">these produced my philosophy</a>. Now _that's_ absurdism! <br><br>

* No excuses, no wiggle room, no ambiguity: lifting a lot without injuring yourself is a brute fact, unbiased. Rippetoe: "<i>cause and effect cannot be argued with or circumvented by your wishes and desires.</i>"<br><br>

* 'He's a growing <a href="https://dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/loun">loun</a>!' my granny would say, justifying my early gluttony. Well, twenty years later here I am again, a growing boy. Artificial growth, body neoteny. What does a sense of increase, of coming potential, do to you?<br><br>

* <blockquote>Waiting until soreness subsides before doing the next workout is a good way to guarantee that soreness will be produced every time, since you’ll never get adapted to sufficient workload frequency to stop getting sore.</blockquote><br>

* There are so many ways to do it wrong. (Only some of those wrong ways break you - the others just slow you down or confuse your body.) Rippetoe focusses on five movements, out of however many thousand physiologically possible ones. These are picked for excellent reasons, tested over decades.<br><br>

* <blockquote>Exercise is the thing we must do to replicate the conditions under which our physiology was – and still is – adapted, the conditions under which we are physically normal. In other words, exercise is substitute caveman activity, the thing we need to make our bodies, and in fact our minds, normal in the 21st century.</blockquote><br>

* <blockquote>
  Psychologically, 20 [rep max] work is very hard, due to the pain, and lifters who are good at it develop the ability to displace themselves from the situation during the set. Or they just get very tough.</blockquote><br>

* I live in my head. But the hip drive out of a deep squat is such a strong strange confluence of forces, vaguely under my control but more accurately an explosion I light the fuse on, that I am driven to notice and appreciate neuromuscular marvels.

	<h3>Why listen to Rippetoe on this topic?</h3>
	<div>
		Decades of personal experience plus strong amateur theory plus distilled folk wisdom, in a domain with rapid and unambiguous feedback. He's quite open about unknown things, e.g. the molecular nature of soreness. Sometimes a little defensive, against experts less near to the metal. Sample:<br><br>
		<blockquote>
  			<i>Most sources within the heavy-training community agree that a good starting place is one gram of protein per pound of bodyweight per day, with the rest of the diet making up 3500–6000 calories, depending on training requirements and body composition. Although these numbers produce much eyebrow-raising and cautionary statement-issuing from the registered-dietetics people, it is a fact that these numbers work well for the vast majority of people who lift weights, and these numbers have worked well for decades.</i>

		I've followed <a href="https://stronglifts.com/">Rippetoe's programme</a> inconsistently for 4 months and still got good returns - worth it for mental health alone. I know sophomore biology and physics, and nothing he says here contradicts any of it.
