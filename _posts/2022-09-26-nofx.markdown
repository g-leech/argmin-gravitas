Oddly, NOFX's album _Punk in Drublic_ has more moral imagination than most novels.

Ok sure [some songs](https://genius.com/Nofx-leave-it-alone-lyrics) are the usual impressionistic punk: giving the _impression_ of critique and meaning without saying anything. (Music doesn't have to have a proposition or a narrative, but when a song pretends really hard to have something to say...)

<br>

## 1. 'Linoleum'

About people who subsist. Not quite homeless, not employed. <a href="{{comb}}">Beachcombers</a>, <a href="{{canner}}">canners</a>, buskers, cash-in-hand shadow work in kitchens or construction sites. Some sense of him choosing this as a <a href="{{free}}">freegan</a> / <a href="{{crust}}">crusty</a> / anti-consumerist.

He passes out drunk often, but this isn't a mark of failure. ("<i>Linoleum / supports my head
/ Gives me something to believe</i>")

Not clear to me whether his "metal meter" is a stolen parking <a href="{{met}}">meter</a> or a metal detector.

<br>

## 'Don't Call Me White'

> I can accept responsibility for what I've done<br>
But not for who I am...<br>
I ain't a part of no conspiracy, I'm just your average Joe!
Represents everything I hate<br>
The soap shoved in your mouth, to cleanse the mind

<br>

I once went to a comedy gig by [Kamau Bell](https://www.wkamaubell.com/blog/tag/I%27m+white+and+I%27m+proud). He unsuccessfully attempted to get the pallard Edinburgh crowd to chant "_I'm white and I'm proud_", his point being that good people need to reclaim the identity from the nazis - because only then will there be proper regulation of the current negative element.

NOFX aren't having it. Against identity politics and collective punishment.

It's not (just) a paean to liberalism though -- it's also an attempt to claim '<a href="{{spice}}">spicy white</a>' status as a punk:

> A vast majority of sheep<br>
A buttoned collar, starched and bleached<br>
Constricting veins, the blood flow to the brain slows<br>
They're so fucking ordinary white, [so] don't call me white

<br>


## 'The Brews' 

Subverting Jewish stereotypes.

## 'Lori Meyers' 

A stab at the sex-work question.


## 'Perfect Government'

Class-first social justice

> You point your fuckin' finger<br>
You racist, you bigot<br>
That's not the problem, now is it?<br>
It's all about the money political power is taking<br>
Protectin' the rich, denying the poor

## 'Happy Guy'

Their greatest song. They imagine the comfort and ontological security of a faith they themselves will never have.


## Bonus: 'The Decline'
