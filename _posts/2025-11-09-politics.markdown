Politically, I am a tragedian:

It is tragic that we need governments, that we can't trust markets to deliver what everyone needs.

It is tragic that we need markets, that we can't just trust government to deliver what everyone wants and to not crush the Other.
<!-- reward innovation,  -->

It is tragic that we need corporations, that economies of scale are so important that we must risk monopolies and cronies and skinwalkers.

It is tragic that we need bureaucracies, that the human urge for favoritism and bribes is so strong and ruinous that it's worth imprisoning everyone on earth in a cage of stupid rules.

It is tragic to be forced to choose to not be free.

			It is tragic that you can't say it straight and have to hide behind irony. It is tragic that you are not free despite not being forced to be unfree, which would be a contradiction.
