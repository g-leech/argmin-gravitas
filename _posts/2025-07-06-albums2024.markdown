Last year, I listened to [914 albums](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/gleech/ratings/release-date/17/) released last year. I had a few aims: capturing the zeitgeist; seeing if our usual sense that new stuff isn't as good is actually true; to be contrarian in the [music catalog age](https://www.infinitescroll.us/p/old-art-is-strangling-new-art); to see what it's like to be [Piero Scaruffi](https://scaruffi.com/cdreview/index.html). I got all of those.

914 is a pretty huge sample, but it's still less than 1% of any sensible measure of new music (one site I like [lists](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/2024/releases/?page=2260) 135,000 albums of 2024). It is more than 1% of notable new music though.

## Vibe

True to hipster type I was unimpressed with most of what others were impressed with. 

[Critics](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/ratings/6-highest-rated/2024/1)
[Extrememly-online herd users](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/ratings/user-highest-rated/2024/)

The biggest difference between the (>35 year old) critics and the users is the latter losing their minds over the latest iteration of mumble rap (billy woods, Danny Brown, Vince Staples, and JPEGMAFIA).

Oldies still doing great, great work: Mount Eerie, Melt-Banana, Einst√ºrzende, Julia Holter, Arab Strap, J Mascis, Godspeed You, Laura Marling, Paysage d'Hiver, Melvins, Blixa, Vampire Weekend, Fred Frith, Four Tet, Xiu Xiu, Tyler, Wilco, Redd Kross, St Vincent. One last go from Shellac and Ryuichi Sakamoto.

It was of course _Brat_ summer but I wouldn't be surprised if after, like, next year it is [never mentioned](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fg%2F11y35crs5j&hl=en) ever again. Obvious empty hype and social proof to me at the time.

Totally new stuff:
