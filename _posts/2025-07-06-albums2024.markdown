Last year, I listened to [914 albums](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/gleech/ratings/release-date/17/) released last year. I had a few aims: capturing the zeitgeist; seeing if the usual sense we have that new stuff isn't as good is actually true; to be contrarian in the [catalog age](https://www.infinitescroll.us/p/old-art-is-strangling-new-art); to see what it's like to be [Piero Scaruffi](https://scaruffi.com/cdreview/index.html). I think I got all of those.

914 is a pretty huge sample, but it's still less than 1% of any sensible measure of new music (one site I like [lists](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/2024/releases/?page=2260) 135,000 albums of 2024). It's probably more than 1% of notable new music though.

## Top 5

Compilations and box sets are cheating, though.
