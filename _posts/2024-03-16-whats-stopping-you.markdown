**Audience interaction**: Who here has a clear idea of what they want from life?

**Audience interaction**: Who here has a clear idea of how to get it?

That was a joke; very few 50 year old adults have a good answer to both of those questions.


<br><br>


This is a class about a fatal trap that lies in wait for the brilliant but unwary young person: success; or other people’s definitions of success.

This class is a polemic. I make a number of [extremely large](https://www.gleech.org/stopping#:~:text=Giant%20claims%20in%20this%20class) claims. Feel free to challenge them, we have time.

<br><br>

### What we mean by success

1. **“Excellence”**: Ordinary success. Pejorative, here. Default. money, status, fame, Ivy League degree, fancy title, proximity to power <br><br>
2. **“Greatness”**. _Very roughly for the purposes of argument_, doing something no one has ever done before. <br><br>
3. **Self-fulfilment**. whatever you want _including all of the above_

<br>

_You cannot allow other people to decide what you want from life._ This is the most likely single thing to ruin your life. Doing the wrong thing reduces your effective lifespan by 40 years: i.e. the length of your career. If excellence was a chemical substance it would be banned in every country and limited to extremely well-ventilated hazmat laboratories.

This includes me. All of the following is conditional on what _you_ want in life. 

<br><br>




### 1. What do you want in life? 


**Audience interaction**: 5mins silent writing

Ask people to share.


While you’re thinking I will list some examples. 

Scientific discovery, art, parenting, happiness, taste, freedom, slack, chill, Enlightenment, fun, safety, doing something genuinely new, Connection, fulfilling my duties, untarnished goodness, neoteny, original seeing, great stories, peace, a nest and place of rest, being a net source, synthesis, recognition, appreciating others, hands in soil, retiring early, saving the world, varietymaxxing




<br><br>


### 2. What’s missing in the world? 



Same question with a different centre of gravity

**Audience interaction**: 3mins silent writing

Ask people to share.

<br><br>




### The Excellence trap

Most smart people do not change the world much.

Why? They get trapped in excellence. Instead of making a path for themselves, they climb the *ladders* that already exist. Life on rails. It's easier. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>

Never underestimate people's hatred for establishing their own independent set of values and planning an optimal sequence of decisions according to them. Uncertainty about your values and the best actions for them is so painful and intractable that, upon for the first time exiting the cave aged 22, most people instantly find a new cave to hide in. (Ok, maybe the 22 year old who makes this decision isn't fully informed of the gravity of their decision.)

"[Value capture](https://philarchive.org/rec/NGUVCH)"? No, not here. This is value relinquishment. Value abandonment.

I call them ladders because they 1) are linear, 2) break up life progress into small, unthreatening local gradient steps, 3) provide an unambiguous path forward, 4) are rigid and fixed in place. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a>

What other ways up are there? Well, there's the grappling hook. It's risky.

<br>


<br><br>

### ~All old or large institutions are ladders

* Corporate ladder - L7 ($1m a year), C-level, first class flights, PA, suits
* Government ladder
* Academia ladder - how many of you know how tenure works?
* Nonprofit ladder - grand speeches and unbelievable inefficiency
* [Fine art ladder](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/28/poor-artists-by-the-white-pube-review-how-to-make-it-in-the-art-world)
* Startup ladder - TKS, [WC](https://www.startupworldcup.io/)
* EA ladder


The reasons that old institutions so often end up doing unoriginal and fake things are deep and interesting but for a later session.

Two fundamental reasons that these places lead you away from your own values: 
* Organisations are complex. [Internal politics distract you](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/). Most of the org is not at the coalface, getting any real feedback at all.
* Success in the org is a proxy objective for your success. If you optimise a proxy [hard enough](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dC7mP5nSwvpL65Qu5/why-the-tails-come-apart), you can [diverge very very far](https://windowsontheory.org/2021/01/15/ml-theory-with-bad-drawings/#:~:text=The%20metric%20gap%3A%20In%20almost%20all%20cases%2C%20we%20do%20not%20optimize%20the%20actual%20measure%20of%20success%20we%20care%20about%2C%20but%20rather%20another%20metric%20that%20is%20at%20best%20correlated%20with%20it.) from what you actually want.


<br><br>

### Me

Another thing that stops people: not realising that _you can just do things_. You don’t need permission, you usually don’t need a credential, you don’t need to solve all your personal problems first.

I’m the first person in my family to finish college. Grandparents farmers. Mother a cleaner. I was also shy and depressed for a lot of the first 20 years. It took me a while to get going. 

But! Several times in my life, people have tapped me on the shoulder and told me that I wasn’t living up to my potential.

* I was working in London finance, doing “very well”, not working very hard. But the work was meaningless and the corporation I inhabited was extremely dysfunctional. I told a researcher I met that I didn’t think I was good enough to do a PhD. He scoffed and said that I was obviously far above median.<br><br>
* A bit later, I was a researcher, I was in a PhD. But no one was really paying any attention. I sent a famous public intellectual my work. He sent me $30,000 and promoted my work to millions of people. This led to me starting my company, working on incredibly fun things all the time, and never worrying about money ever again.<br><br>
* At the same time, I didn’t have a circle. I had friends but no collaborators, no one who cared about the things I cared about, no one pushing me to do concrete better work. I didn’t think of myself as a leader. I went to Czechia and met this crazy bunch of researchers and meditators and programmers. It was one of the most fun weeks of my life. Some time later, they asked me to lead this camp for teenagers they run.

<br>

I was waiting for permission ... from no-one... and was deluded about how much it takes to be great, to do actually new things. 

My hope is that this class is the last tap on the shoulder you need.

<br><br>

### What stops people?

* The excellence trap
* No "hero licence" (social or internal permission to do new things, nonstandard things, ambitious things)
* Ignorance of the option set (I didn't hear about school olympiads until I was 26 years old)
* Miscalibration about [skill](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/) requirements or your own skill level. Ignore job "requirements".

<br><br>


### 3. What is stopping you? 

**Audience interaction**: 5mins silent writing

Ask people to share.

Parents, Skill, School, Poverty, Lack of self-knowledge, Miscalibration about how much skill you need, Lack of connections, Credentials. “Job requirements”, Team , Ideas, Audience, Excellence trap, Youth, Courage. “Permission”

<br>


Another problem: To attain self-fulfilment, others must comply.

<br><br>


### 4. After that is relaxed, what's stopping you (1min)



Recall what you said is stopping you. That was your top 1. What about the next bit?



<br><br>

### 5. After that is relaxed, what's stopping you (1min)



<br><br>


### Are you the right amount of ambitious? 

I cannot tell you “be more ambitious”. It’s a tightrope with terrible waste on either extreme. 

\[rails, inauthenticity, fakery, waste\]     
<br>
vs 
<br>

\[wasted resources, pretension, stress, waste\]



The golden median is different for each of you. One of the chief tasks of your life is finding it.

<br><br>


### 6. What can we do for you? What can you do for the above this week? (5 mins)


You fail this class if you do not ask for something

<br>


help finding who to contact (profs, founders, anons); 
help writing cold emails; 
help starting a blog and plugging it; 
help calibrating ambition level correctly (usually up); 
help finding funding; 
help developing mastery (maths, forecasting, public speaking, whatev); 
scholarships; 
detailed research feedback; 
finding collaborators; 
Create hard things; 
Find your coterie; 
Ask people without shame.


<br><br>


### Damage control



One thing you might take away from this class is that you need to do _bigger_ things -- put even more pressure on yourself. 

No! I am telling you that you have that option, you are more powerful than you think.

Ladders are useful. Most useful work takes place inside them, despite them. You can't scale without a ladder. It's fine to [rest and vest](https://www.google.com/search?q=rest+and+vest&client=ubuntu-chr&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) once in a while.

Please do not let me tell you what to do.

<br>

Most work makes the world better in a small and quiet way. This is a beautiful thing. M once worked on Google’s central TCP/IP stack. He commented out one line and sped up every single web request that Google performs. A quadrillion of milliseconds saved every day = 11 years of human life every year. He says this is likely the most valuable day of work he ever did for them.

Getting to L6 at Google or wherever; having 2 children; saying true things; retiring at 50; being kind. This is a lot. It is more than most humans who ever lived achieved.



<br><br>









<!-- Mathematics is one of the least fake things in the world. But you still see the trap there. 
People memorise proofs and names and trade off against understanding. 
Reading too much is dangerous past a certain point. IMO “oh apply Cauchy-Schwartz”

    <h3>Why do large orgs go fake?</h3>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>simply: as it gets larger most of the org is no longer in contact with external reality: instead they handle (necessary at scale!) internal processes. They can't know what the current realities are. But they still get a fractional vote in what the org is and does. So the mission drifts.</li>
<!--  -->
            <li>success draws <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uiEoxLh8kaDzkayfL/on-geeks-mops-and-sociopaths">predators and conformists</a> who do not understand or care about the mission. They <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem">free-ride</a> or worse. This repels or demoralises the original aligned crew.</li>
<!--  -->
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">communication overhead</a> grows fast in number of people. This is another cause of <a href="https://status451.com/2016/08/09/too-late-for-the-pebbles-to-vote-part-1/">information silos</a>, which makes the other problems here much worse.</li>
<!--  -->
            <li>vision and originality is not a constant, it requires a constant fight against entropy. The original energy is very <a href="https://samoburja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Great_Founder_Theory_by_Samo_Burja_2020_Manuscript.pdf">unlikely</a> to get preserved after the founders move on</li>
<!--  -->
            <li>The introduction of middle management totally <a href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/">changes the game</a>, creating a "mesa-optimiser" inside the org which is maximising its share of resources instead of the org's official goal</li>
<!--  -->
            <li>
                Even the most powerful orgs on earth are more sensitive to PR and internal PR than you'd think.

    <h3>Closed worlds</h3>
    <div>
    <blockquote>In high school and college, we get additional degrees of freedom. We choose our majors, the colors of our socks, the identities we wear. Still, however, the system exists within a larger narrative. Close to perfectly determined. The right way is to win the zero-sum peer-competitions: cross country races, debate championships, Putnam medals, Rhodes scholarships, internships to financial trading/law/software firms.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>However, we have spent the first twenty four years of our life within highly determined systems. The openness of an underdetermined system is beyond our capacity to navigate...  the heuristic seems to be mimicry. We will copy what we see other people doing. And so, aspiring elites, habituated to optimize within an overdetermined small world, seem to end up competing for a small number of positions at selective institutions that in return to unhappily reenact the small world competitive impulses</blockquote>

<h3>Ways to identify fake ambition</h3>
<div>
    <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uGDtroD26aLvHSoK2/dear-self-we-need-to-talk-about-ambition-1">Lifting heavily from Elizabeth vN</a><br><br>
    Sometimes it’s hard to tell if you authentically want something, or are trying to impress people with how ambitious you are. A few tricks:<br><br>

* What do you feel when you think about shrinking the project?<br><br>
    * Anger, fear, or disappointment that the goal won’t be accomplished = seems like you care a lot, good sign for the project. <br><br>
    * Relief = project seems like a lot of work. Consider if you’re up for that level of work before beginning (but the answer might be yes).<br><br>
    * Fear of failure = this is a terrible sign, unless you have some reason the smaller version is more likely to fail (if you do, try the question again with a version that is easier and more likely to succeed). If failure feels like a bigger threat for a project that is objectively easier, that’s a suggestion you are, on some level, not taking the big version seriously. If you were, it would be scarier.<br><br>
    * Fear of other people’s reaction = your primary motivation here is probably social. Knowing that, do you still want to go forward? The answer can be yes, although if so I hope the project is cheap.<br><br><br><br>

* If you fail, will you or the people around you go “well what did you expect?” That would suggest your goal is unachievable from your current state.<br><br>
* Another reason smaller projects can be scarier is that people will judge you more for failing. Don’t let this push you into too-big projects.<br><br>
* If you fail, will it be educational? “No” is both a sign the project is too big (because you don’t understand it well enough) and a reason the project is too big (you’re going to pour all that energy in and not even get learning out?)<br><br>
* How does concrete, accurate, actionable criticism make you feel? <br><br>
    * If it’s a real goal you should be delighted, because feedback helps you reach that goal faster. Or if you’re a little less evolved, not delighted, but at least it feels like a really productive massage or workout, where it hurts but you can tell it will be worth it. If you feel terrified, or angry, or especially unsupported, that suggests you care more about the social aspect of the project than its outcome.<br><br>
* Does the project give you a satisfying feeling of contact with reality? That’s maybe a sign it’s a real goal, and definitely good in general.<br><br>
* What does “contact with reality” mean? That is a very reasonable question I don’t have a good answer for, at least not in words. Hopefully you’ll know it when you see it.<br><br>

    <h3>EMH</h3>
    <div>
        Old joke: Two economists are walking down the street and see $20 on the sidewalk. “Ignore it” one says, “if it was real someone would already have picked it up”. The dollar bills are life-changing ideas.<br><br>

* Feb 2020 Covid, some of the ESPR instructors spotted things that weren’t going to get done. No background, no credentials. <br><br>
* I’ve published well in psychology and epidemiology and linguistics. I’ve never taken a class in these or read a textbook in them. Just ain’t that hard.<br><br>
* I’ve advised the UK government 3 times on topics<br><br>

* Who knows what a monotile is?<br><br>
* We have the first safe and effective obesity treatment since 2021.<br><br>
* We discovered that multiple sclerosis is caused by Epstein-Barr<br><br>
* Brain-spine interface<br><br>
* Mars is geologically active. It has volcanoes<br><br>

How do startups beat companies 10,000 times larger than them? 1) Noticing something about the domain. 2) Also speed. OpenAI was initially nine people. Wise worked out how to use ACH outside the US.<br><br>


The world is too high-dimensional to be explored easily, for EMH to apply.
