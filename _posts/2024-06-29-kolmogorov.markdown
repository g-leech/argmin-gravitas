> In 1946 Luzin seemed to agree to support Alexandrov's admission to the Academy, but then withdrew. Kolmogorov slapped Luzin in the face at the Academy. The president of the Academy [of Sciences] SI Vavilov, said to Kolmogorov: "Well old man, you sure started something..." Vavilov told Stalin what had happened. Stalin said "Well, such things occur with us as well." 

> In 1946, the Academy had to elect a new group of members, this time with preference to the applied sciences. This [preference] allowed Lusin to vote against the topologist Aleksandrov. To everybody’s consternation, as a reaction, Kolmogorov slapped Lusin’s face on the floor of the Academy. The president of the Academy, S. I. Vavilov, was at a loss
of what to do. Finally the incident was reported to the Kremlin. It was said
that Stalin was not astonished. "This happens even among us," was his
reply. In other words, Stalin recommended to do nothing. But the Academy did. Kolmogorov lost all his administrative positions; in particular, he was fired from the directorship of Mathematical Research Institute of [MSU].

MacPherson tells a spicier version, and he knew some of the protagonists personally so maybe:
