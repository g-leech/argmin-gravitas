The president of the Academy [of Sciences] SI Vavilov, said to Kolmogorov: "Well old man, you sure started something..." Vavilov told Stalin what had happened. Stalin said "Well, such things occur with us as well."

that Stalin was not astonished. "This happens even among us," was his
reply. In other words, Stalin recommended to do nothing. But the Academy did. Kolmogorov lost all his administrative positions; in particular, he was fired from the directorship of Mathematical Research Institute of [MSU].
