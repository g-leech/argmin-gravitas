> first one has to learn to hear a figure and melody at all, to detect and distinguish it, to isolate it and delimit it as a separate life; then it requires some exertion and good will to tolerate it in spite of its strangeness, to be patient with its appearance and expression, and kindhearted about its oddity <br><br>:— finally there comes a moment when we are used to it, when we wait for it, when we sense that we should miss it if it were missing: and now it continues to compel and enchant us relentlessly until we have become its humble and enraptured lovers who desire nothing better from the world than it and only it. —<br><br>But that is what happens to us not only in music: that is how we have learned to love all things that we now love. In the end we are always rewarded for our good will, our patience, fairmindedness, and gentleness with what is strange; gradually, it sheds its veil and turns out to be a new and indescribable beauty :— that is its thanks for our hospitality. Even those who love themselves will have learned it in this way: for there is no other way. Love, too, has to be learned.

There is so much to understand, so many things to like - and all of us understand and like very little of it. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a> If you're young, your preferences maybe define you - but you could be defined by something else. If you're any age, they determine who you spend your time with - but you could spend time with almost anyone.

It's easy to forget how inexhaustible the natural and human world is. This year I've been running classes on _the art of getting into things_. I collected all the interests and subcultures my students are into (or actively not into):<br><br>

You can attempt to get into any such system of meaning. What's a word for those? "Culture" - but they can be _much_ smaller than the national units we usually mean by "culture". So here take "a culture" to mean a subculture, an <a href="{{id}}">idiom</a>, a scene, a style, a genre, a field, a medium, a view. 

<i>Claim</i>: every human activity, and every group of humans larger than one, forms a culture. It's often intentionally hard for outsiders to understand. <a href="{{j}}">Reality has a lot of detail</a>, and humans, good humans, paint this detail with <a href="{{prozd}}">meaning and distinctions</a>. Cracking these codes is the most important skill which is barely taught anywhere. <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a>

Every year I try to get into something major. Hacker lore (2014); "modern classical" music (2020); Chinese poetry (2011); Analytic philosophy (2008); economic rationality (2013); dank memes (2017); singing in public (2016); teaching (2020); this year, <a href="{{c}}">comic books</a>. <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a>

## Why?


### 1. Fun! Access more of the value in the world. 

It's more than just liking more cool stuff. It's about treating your own taste and interest as an object in question, an object which could be worked on. About treating outgroups as puzzles rather than threats or weirdos. 

<br>

### 2. Social life

What you like determines who you spend your time with. It often determines your life partner. Businesses and academic fields are famously culturally ornate and hard to crack.

You've probably had the experience of being at a party and realising that the stranger next to you shares your love of Japanese noise rock, or loose-leaf tea, or Afro-futurism, or Adult Swim. You've probably had some amazing conversations as a result. This tells us we can deeply interact with 10x more strangers.

<br>

### 3. Understand people!

* You break off a piece of the giant impossible concept of human culture overall.

* Subcultures do a large amount of all new and interesting work. (This is almost true by definition in art. But also startups: to replace a huge corporate incumbent, you have to have a different angle, and often they are outsiders.)

<!-- * _General subtlety of thought._ -->

* _Mental flexibility_. One of the evils of ageing is bewilderment: feeling that the world is bizarre and unmanageable, that you can't interact with the young, that you are relegated. Active effort and mastery of cultures should prevent this.

#### Why aesthetics?

Above, I made grand claims about large portions of all human activities being available to crack. <a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8">8</a> So why am I talking about comics?

Aesthetics is a great place to start because it's so cheap and the experiments are so quick. It's also surprisingly impactful, socially powerful. <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a> And also because once you stop seeing your taste as immutable (or god forbid correct) you can pursue all of the rest of the world.

I really think there’s a general skill here - that understanding punk deeply really does increase my ability to understand Tanzanian culture, let alone prog and disco and post-punk and dub and thrash.


<br>

## A spectrum

Three ways of relating to a genre, a medium, an art, a school of thought, a field:<br><br>
<!--  -->
<ol>
	<li><b>Love</b>: <a href="{{prozd}}">to find value</a> <a href="{{xkcd}}">in ordinary examples</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Open to</b>: to see the value of the best examples.</li>
	<li><b>Not open to</b>: to struggle to see the value of even the best.</li>
</ol>

<br>

<img data-src="/img/cultural/spectrum.png" class="lazy" /> 

<br>

I claim that 0% and 100% are basically never correct. Most things fall into 30-40%. We want to move from 20% to 60% on most things. (It would be very distracting to love everything.) 

<br>

<br>

Pick something you're not open to. Ask:

* Why don't I like it?

* Do I not like the people who like it?

* Do my friends dislike it?

* Does it offend me? Is it ugly? Low class? Pretentious?

* What is it trying to do?*

* How would I have to change to get it?

<br>

  \* didn't realise that I'd ripped this off from Ebert. Or from Christgau, who ripped it off from Ebert

## Actionable bits of a cultural code

<center>
<blockquote>To make something interesting, just look at it a long time.</blockquote>

― Gustave Flaubert
</center><br>

### 1. Canon. 

You need to start with the greatest (or the most accessible greats) so that you can remove one source of uncertainty and solve for the remaining unknown: your stomach for it. Some cultures revolt against the idea of a canon, and but all of them have secret shibboleth canons behind the listicle canons.

Finding critics you can trust helps, because their activity consists in taking the unwritten and writing it down. (Obviously they never fully succeed.) Outside literature, academics are often surprisingly poor critics.

Once you know the canon, you can get the _allusions_, and you can understand the principal components, the ways instances are supposed to vary.

Note that I do not mean the vanilla starter-pack consensus canon! For instance, learning about great cinema through Oscar Best Pictures would be a terrible idea. Nor do I mean the dumb hipster inversion of it.
<br><br>


### 2. Jargon, conventions, techniques

Too specific to say much about here. Critics again, or else a hard act of empiricism.<br><br>

<img data-src="/img/cultural/mang.png" width="70%" class="lazy" />
<img data-src="/img/cultural/mang2.png" width="70%" class="lazy" />
<br><br>

### 3. Material conditions

Say you try it. Say you pick the top 10 all-time whatevers. But you bounce off - it all seems so contrived / so hostile to its audience / so trivial / so pretentious. What to do?

One powerful trick is to study what Marxists call the <a href="{{mat}}">material conditions</a>. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a> For our purposes this is not a grand reduction of the ideal to the economic, it's just 1) how capital-intensive it is, 2) the demographics of the creators and audience, 3) the tempo and complexity of production (weekly for manga, a month for a serious poem). Then: _how do they do it?_ Those timelapse videos of someone painting or carving are ideal.

I watched every Kubrick film and didn't really see the fuss. Then I read up on him, and learned that e.g. he had <a href="{{jon}}">thousands upon thousands of doorways</a> in London photographed while location scouting for _Eyes Wide Shut_.
It's not that obsessiveness means quality, that inputs mean output. But it means _meaning_. As I rewatch him, I have good reason to consider many parts of the production as meaningful, and in fact I like him far more on the second runthrough.<br><br>

Only once you know what's good, what the axes are, and how it's made can you understand originality, deviance, substyles, and your own sense of the greatness.

## Procedure

1. Try to go a week without art or entertainment. Fasting, clearing the palate; creating a need in yourself
1. Find a critic you can trust. Friends are best. \[2 weeks\]<br><br>
2. Where is the quality? What is it _trying_ to do? \[2 weeks\]<br><br>
3. What are the material conditions? \[2 weeks\]<br><br>
4. If you really can't see any value: what's sociologically remarkable about it?<br><br>
5. When do I just accept that I am not capable of liking this? <a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6">6</a>
