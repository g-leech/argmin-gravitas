What is a magic word? A word which is not just a symbol? A causal word?

Such spells exist. Just say "noise" to yourself, and it appears. Shout "police!" long enough and you will summon the demon you name. "Confusion!", in company. "Speech-act". "Disquotation" après-moi. "<a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2014-08-04">Entropy</a>!" arguably.<br><br>


(All quite aside from <i>code</i>, the living words eating the economy and the intellect, and so <a href="http://breakingsmart.com/season-1/a-new-soft-technology/">the world</a>.)
