...<i>do her words really need to be broken down like formulae? I think not. Simply to escape into the world of Joanna and be incapsulated into it and applauding it is enough.

## Give love a little shove and it becomes terror

Newsom is hard work. Well, <i>Have One On Me</i> is a map of the heart, and you shouldn't expect those to offer themselves lightly. 

The album covers the forms of love: <i>divine</i> or <i>agape</i> (tracks (<a href="#section8.3">3</a>, <a href="#section8.7">7</a>, <a href="#section8.14">14</a>); <i>filial</i> (<a href="#section8.9">track 9</a>, <a href="#section8.14">14</a>); <i>courtly</i> (<a href="#section8.2">track 2</a>); <i>obsessional</i> (tracks <a href="#section8.1">1</a>, <a href="#section8.5">5</a>, <a href="#section8.10">10</a>); <i>maternal</i> (<a href="#section8.6">track 6!</a> but touches in <a href="#section8.1">1</a>, <a href="#section8.5">5</a>, <a href="#section8.11">11</a>, <a href="#section8.14">14</a>); <i>platonic</i> (passionate friendship: <a href="#section8.8">track 8</a> and maybe <a href="#section8.11">11</a>); <i>panicked</i> (track <a href="#section8.4">4</a>); <i>dependent</i> (track <a href="#section8.5">5</a>, <a href="#section8.10">10</a>, <a href="#section8.16">16</a>); <i>wilful</i> (track <a href="#section8.1">1</a>, <a href="#section8.16">16</a>); <i>of place</i> (<a href="#section8.9">track 9</a>); <i>destructive</i> (<a href="#section8.2">2</a>, <a href="#section8.8">8</a>, <a href="#section8.10">10</a>, <a href="#section8.15">15</a>, <a href="#section8.3">16?</a>, <a href="#section8.17">17?</a>); <i>forbidden</i> (<a href="#section8.2">track 2</a>); <i>unrequited</i> (<a href="#section8.18">track 18</a> above all, but <a href="#section8.1">1</a>, <a href="#section8.7">7</a>, <a href="#section8.10">10</a>, <a href="#section8.15">15</a>) and <i>love of self</i> (track <a href="#section8.3">3</a>, <a href="#section8.4">4</a>, <a href="#section8.13">13</a>). It exalts, despairs, casts about in the land.

Rock reviews miss the point in territory like this. There was a great deal written about it being a triple!! album!!!, which obscures the <i>real</i> way it's ambitious; this 123-minute thing requires patience because of its richness, not its length. The length (songs 6 mins on average), her  vocabulary, voice, caesura, unfamiliar instruments slow us down, and then there's the alien allusions that leave us out, first of all.

Pretension, affectation, whimsy are just unavoidable side-effects of ambition. The lyrics work on their own as poetry, which is so rare in even the best pop music <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>.

It ain't Renaissance music, but it is sacred. (American Secular Sacred). My mate James says it's "_a book of an album. It's Middlemarch_", and this is the case. Though, since it's episodic and woozy and dark, I'd call it Nabokov's <i><a href="http://www.ada.auckland.ac.nz/">Ada</a></i> more. James also spits at people who emphasise the bits of her that appear Medieval&nbsp;- but the fact is, she <i>is</i> making historical music; it's drenched in dead music. But it's the blues; Ol' Opry cakewalks; cabaret; parlour-music; Appalachiana; and gospel, rather than the pre-Baroque. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershwin">Gershwin</a> &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Gibbons">Gibbons</a>.) Given this marinade of early American popular music and William Faulkner, Newsom sounds lasting.


I don't listen to her for historical satisfaction. What I love about it are the many moments of perfect sound and sense, the grand <a href="{{hook}}">hooks</a>". There's so many here because the songs are so long and get the time to climb all that way up.

## Man vs Life

<img loading="lazy" src="/img/hoom/big.png" >

A type of love pointedly missing in the above rundown is <i>empathic</i> love. Where <i>Ys</i> burbled with anthropomorphisations, companion animals, and a general affinity with the universe, <i>Have One on Me</i>, while still full of nature, is much more about the Rancher (a lonesome, domineering social product nestling in a hostile world). It's sensual, snug, and macabre where _Ys_ was abstract, epic, and pure.

"<i>I hope Mother Nature has not overheard!<br />(Though, she doles out hurt like a puking bird.)</i>" - <a href="#section8.8"><i>You and Me, Bess</i></a> 


"<i>Driven through with her own sword,<br /> 
Summer died last night, alone.</i>" - <a href="#section8.15"> Autumn</a>


"<i>Wolf-spider, crouch in your funnel nest,<br />...have I had a hand in your loneliness?</i>" - <a href="#section8.11"> Go Long</a>

"<i>Black nose of the dog / As cold as a rifle </i>" - <a href="#section8.16"> Ribbon Bows</a> 


With nature so terrible, the only safe place is civilisation, specifically the arms of someone who may or may not stay. The cover is filled with dead things: a judgmental peacock, half-plucked; a stuffed deer wearing a feather headdress; a divan draped in leopardskin - and her, langorous and deathly in the centre. And her animal motif-characters are this time uniformly malign - even Bess the horse makes "glad neighing", at highwayman-Joanna's hanging.


The significance is that the animals are <i>aspects</i> of the human characters. Newsom deals with the coldnesses, stubbornnesses or malices of the male lead and female lead via animal symbols.

## The arc

The best hope for a unified story arc comes if we pick out the farm couple, seen most clearly in track 5, "No Provenance". This easily ties into the Californian childhood arc, which is also the one who is intrigued by Lola Montez and empathises with her vengeance. My reading splits things into:

<ul>
	<li>FARM COUPLE songs (tracks 1, 5, 17, and 18) most clearly, but the others fit pretty well.</li>
	<br />
	<li>ALLEGORIES (tracks 2, 3, 8, 11, 17). Aye; more allegorical than usual.</li>
</ul>


Who are 'the farm couple' then? <em>She</em> is a grown woman on earth variously known as "Lola"; a mad horse; Birch's mother; Dick Turpin; a Nevadan; Esme's adorer; "slow-heart"; Joanna Newsom. I'll call her <i>J</i>. 

<i>He</i> is, variously: "King Ludwig I"; "dragon"; "Bess"; Bluebeard; a magpie and a bluejay; a wolf-spider; a "silly goose"; "long-life"; and various hinted-at male celebrities whom I'm not interested in gaping at. Call him <i>B</i>.


We've only clues. I say "Newsom" when I mean "the songwriter", and "J" for the protagonist - nothing more presumptuous (history is just organised gossip).

I don't believe in overreading. Interpretations are second-order features, and if you honestly see [x] in a thing, then [x] is there. 

The album has an arc: from the courting of "Easy" to the final moving out of the shared apartment in "It Does Not Suffice". Each disc has its own subarc too (consider the mood swing between "Esme" and the next track), but I'm less clear on those.

## Misc notes

<div class="accordion">
	{%		include hoom/voice.html		%}
	<h3>DRUM</h3>
	<div>
		Neal Morgan's percussion work (writing and performing) is the only voice in the thing that matches hers (all the other instruments are in thrall). A couple of times he saves her from gaucheness - imagine; drums, adding sophistication! - like when she does her bird-swoops at the end of "In California".<br><br>
		He's got a particular jazz-born genius, but it's more obvious live. He makes the first disc ring out, then retreats from disc 2 except his star turn in "In California". His drumwork is the album's weather or stage design. They thunder (In California) and give the upbeat (Good Intentions) a tailwind. And, in the plaintive explosion that closes the album, they're the sound and fury that J is too undone to have.
