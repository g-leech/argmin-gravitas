		Let me emphasize that there is no such thing as "first" in any activity associated with human invention. If you add enough adjectives to a description you can always claim your own favorite. For example the ENIAC is often claimed to be the "first electronic, general purpose, large scale, digital computer" and you certainly have to add all those adjectives before you have a correct statement...

	<p>People think they know what they mean when they say "computer" - it's the thing with a screen and a mouse that gives you cat photos. In that narrow sense, the <a href="{{SDS}}">SDS 940</a> (1968) that ran <a href="{{NLS}}">Engelbart's On-Line System</a> was 'the first computer'.</p>


	<p>This is obviously no good: it disqualifies a hundred years of earlier digital computers. Luckily, the name's a clue: computers are things that do computations. However, <a href="{{Digit}}">all of reality</a> can be <a href="{{Aaronson}}">usefully considered as computation</a>. So a computer can't be just "a system which transforms physical information", because everything does that. </p>


	<p><b>Data</b>: A randomly selected atom is not a computer. A gun is not a computer. An abacus is not a computer, nor is its descendent the slide rule. A <a href="{{Monkey}}">primate doing addition</a> is not the <a href="{{wet}}">kind</a> <a href="{{homin}}">of computer</a> we are talking about. So we want the first <i>inorganic device that can do complex information-processing automatically, on demand</i>. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a> </p>


	<p>(Electricity isn't key, though. The fact that we use <a href="{{volt}}">voltages</a> to conduct most of our computations is a matter of <a href="{{flow}}">convenience</a>, not <a href="{{xkcd}}">essence</a>.)</p>


	<p>When asking "what was the first computer?", people usually mean the first <i>modern</i> computer, where "modern" is some collection of the following properties: fully-electronic, Turing-complete, stored-program, binary-digital, parallelised, integrated-circuit-transistorised, virtual-memory, instruction-set-architecture, presenting a <a href="{{metaphor}}">desktop metaphor</a> to the user.</p>
