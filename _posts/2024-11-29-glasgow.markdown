> The Scots (originally Irish, but by now Scots) were at this time inhabiting Ireland, having driven the Irish (Picts) out of Scotland; while the Picts (originally Scots) were now Irish (living in brackets) and vice versa. It is essential to keep these distinctions clearly in mind (and verce visa).

* I stayed 3 years, learning to code. At the time, the head of department was the formidable [Chris Johnson](https://nitter.net/g_leech_/status/1886049453171229174#m), now chief scientific advisor to the UK government.

* Glasgow has the most _asabiyah_ of any place I've lived. Which is strange when you consider that there is still an ancient smouldering faux-religious spat in it, and that _most_ schools were still segregated by faith as recently as the 1980s, and the Catholic school system is still going strong ([16% of all Scottish schools](https://www.gov.scot/publications/foi-202400425708/)). Some amateur notes: Glasgow’s "sectarianism" is more tribal than religious. (Maybe that's the typical case - poor churchies.) And it's imported - in the great migration wave of the 1850s Famine, we took many from Belfast, who brought their anger with them. You can tell because the rest of Scotland is chill. 

How can they have maintained this for 170 years, when the rest of the country got over it long ago? Cycle of violence and gangs.

Or maybe they haven't.
[My old sociology prof](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/apr/24/scotland-sectarianism-research-data) used to startle people by saying: 
> Most Scots are not football fans; most fans do not support Rangers or Celtic; most Rangers and Celtic fans are not religious bigots. That some Rangers and Celtic fans wind each other up by falsely claiming to have strong religio-ethnic identities which are offended by the equally false religio-ethnic identities of the other side is not a reason for the rest of us to take such ritual posturing as the basis for judging the polity, society and culture of an entire country.

> The sectarianism of Scotland is a myth: popular in some places but a myth nonetheless. A major survey in 2001 in Glasgow showed that many people thought sectarianism discrimination in employment was common but that none had suffered it themselves – it was something they had heard had happened to others.

He leans pretty heavily on the relative lack of segregated 'hoods and turfs (unlike Belfast).

We're used to small groups of thousands dictating the culture of millions - consider Rhodesia or Harvard or English public school. But that's elites. It is less usual for a small underclass to determine the group's self-identity (here, as a sectarian nation). 

* Like Liverpool, Glasgow is a half-Irish place. What do I mean by this? Craic, cheek, communitarianism, gab.

* It's somehow the artiest place in Scotland _and_ the most [violent](https://www.gov.scot/publications/homicide-scotland-2023-24/pages/main-findings/#:~:text=Locations%20of%20homicides) and demotic. The humour and antipretension can border on repressive though.
