* 3 years. I learned to code here, and spent a couple years. At the time, the head of department was the formidable Chris Johnson, now chief scientific advisor.

* It's the artiest place in Scotland and the most violent and demotic. The humour and antipretensions can border on crab-bucket

* The Anniesland Library has impressive security shutters, like blast doors.
