{%	include nation/links.md	%}

I aim to make one strong playlist per country in the world. Current count: 42 / [249](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes#Current_ISO_3166_country_codes).

# Rules


1. Every song has to have moved me. No pandering to national champions or Historical Importance 

2. One song per artist. Side projects ok.

3. Each playlist opens strong, accessible, and wanders its way towards the area's modern classical, metal, and noise music. Down the hole.

4. Ideally there's something in there that any given native will never have heard.

# Caveats

Alright, so it is weird to do one list for all of Brazil (pop. 210m) and one for Aberdeen (pop 0.21m). I welcome contributions from scholars of the music of Feira de Santana (or indeed from any place on earth).

My selection from non-Anglophone countries will be biased towards obviousness and against wit. I forgive a gifted lyricist almost anything (for instance, I love early Mountain Goats), and I mostly can't here.

Most countries seem to have local Indie Gods: Tragically Hip (Canada), Microdisney (Ireland), Cui Jian or Carsick Cars (China), Los Prisioneros (Chile), Die Toten Hosen (Germany), B'z (Japan), Indochine (France), Vasco Rossi (Italy). Most don't survive leaving their context.
