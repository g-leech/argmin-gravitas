# Caveats

Alright, so it is weird to do one list for all of Brazil (pop. 210m) and one for Bristol (pop 0.6m). I welcome contributions from scholars of the music of Feira de Santana (or indeed from any place on earth).

My selection from non-Anglophone countries will be biased towards obviousness and against wit. I forgive a gifted lyricist almost anything (for instance, I love early Mountain Goats), and I mostly can't here.

Most countries seem to have local Indie Gods: Tragically Hip (Canada), Microdisney (Ireland). Mostly don't survive leaving their context.
