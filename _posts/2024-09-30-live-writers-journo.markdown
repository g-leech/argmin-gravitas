People who write regularly 

I say "live writers" because "journalist" has the wrong connotation (shallowness, injustice, generalism out of its depth).

<br>

* _Chemistry_: Derek Lowe (weekly?). Crackling with context and high standards and levity.
* _AI_: Gwern. Hard to spot: his Twitter is great but locked and his lesswrong comments are not very visible, require context.
	* Zvi Mowshowitz (twice weekly) is good and newsy but lacks Gwern's ear and conciseness. Way too long because he's cyborged
* _Finance_: Matt Levine
* _Psychopharmacology_: Scott Alexander
* _Social science_: Rex Douglass
* _Culture war_: Joseph Heath (monthly)
