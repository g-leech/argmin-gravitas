<li>Hedonic utilitarianism aims to maximize pleasure and minimize suffering. This requires accurate knowledge of others' subjective experiences, at least up to a partial ordering.</li>
<li>We lack reliable methods to measure or infer the hedonic value of others' mental states from external observation alone—even seemingly obvious cases (extreme physical pain vs. dignity, autonomy satisfaction) involve massive uncertainty about comparative valences.</li>
<li>Self-report, including consent, is currently our only strong evidence about another person's subjective wellbeing / preferences.</li>
<li>This holds even when external observers are confident their judgment is correct, because: (a) we systematically underestimate interpersonal variation in how experiences are valued, and (b) the consequences of being wrong about someone's subjective state are severe.</li>
<li>Therefore, violating explicit consent (like killing Tom against his will) is anti-utilitarian on straightforwardly hedonic grounds—not merely as a rule or due to downstream social effects, but because doing so means acting on drastically insufficient evidence about the very thing (subjective wellbeing) that hedonic utilitarians claims to maximize.</li>
<li>This dissolves the apparent conflict between utils and autonomy: consent isn't an external constraint on utilitarian reasoning — it *is* utilitarian reasoning properly applied under conditions of fundamental uncertainty about others' experiences.</li>
