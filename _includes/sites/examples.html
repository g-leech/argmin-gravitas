    <h3>Examples of great follies</h3>

            <li>
                <a href="{{scar}}">Piero Scaruffi</a> is the original: 5 decades of sustained idiosyncratic work. He has steadily built a corpus of unbelievable depth and breadth, including 9,000 detailed album-by-album profiles of musicians, and 10 spin-off books which seem to support him financially. His nearest rival is the much more famous Christgau, whose <a href="{{christ}}">almost innavigable site</a> is from 2001 and contains most of his vast professional output. Since John Peelâ€™s knowledge dispersed on his death, we shall make do with these two.

            <li>
                The next I encountered was <a href="{{emerson}}">John Emerson</a>: a scholar of ancient Chinese philosophy, Victorian history, heterodox economics, whatever. He told me his greatest regret was in not finding a community to challenge and be challenged by, to develop and be developed by. Isolation and the attendant irrelevance and <a href="{{hansonsoft}}">softness</a> is the great risk for independent scholars and I remain grateful to him for warning me. I fear him dead.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                <a href="https://gwern.net">Gwern</a>. Besides 100 small projects and his incredible reach on bleeding-edge deep learning, he has made himself the authority on so-called brain training, darknet markets, clever anime criticism, and more recently behavioural genetics.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                Eric Weisstein's <a href="{{math}}">MathWorld</a> rivals Wikipedia for scope and rigour (though it is not forgiving to a beginner). An odd example, because it's the vanity project of a corporation, Wolfram Research, for which Weisstein has been staff encyclopedist for 24 years. Printed in hardcover it is 4300 pages long. Todd Rowland is another major contributor.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
            <a href="{{orthofer}}">Michael Orthofer</a>. 5000+ book reviews - or rather, not reviews, just judgments and one sentence. Mostly literature, and obscure and wonderful and rarefied stuff at that. <a href="{{nyork}}">Incredible geographical scope</a>, well beyond the collected staff of most large newspapers.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>    
            <a href="https://www.themodernnovel.org">An anonymous labour of love</a>. The last 130 years of the novel. 3842 very intelligent summaries and reflections on the 1828 authors.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                <a href="{{pearce}}">David Pearce</a> is about as influential as any freelance philosopher can be. Along with the similarly distinguished researcher <a href="{{brian}}">Brian Tomasik</a>, his <a href="{{empire}}">huge collection</a> of sites on utilitarianism, transhumanism, fundamental ontology, <a href="{{biop}}">nootropics</a> and psychoactives, animal rights, etc, has inspired a whole community of well-funded independent scholars. (NB: Note his unrepeatable trick of registering <a href="{{ut}}">dozens</a> <a href="{{hux}}">of</a> <a href="{{se}}">common</a> vaguely related <a href="{{op}}">domain</a> <a href="{{md}}">names</a>; a spiderweb.)
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                I don't mean to totally demean the public journal style of weblog: there's historical value in seeing what pundits were saying at a given point in the early 21st century. The philosopher <a href="{{rpw}}">Robert Paul Wolff's site</a> is a nice example of the dual nature of a blog: it contains his daily record of American political news <i>and</i> his vast, life-distilling tutorials on the <a href="{{tut}}">great German philosophers</a>. (Inbetween the two are his recollections of <a href="{{russ}}">taking tea with Bertrand Russell</a> and dancing with a Pulitzer Prize winner's wife.)<br><br>This dear man makes me reconsider my strict division: leave both in, let a blog be high and low, short and long. Just as long as you do big stuff if you can. Marginal Revolution is the other obvious example doing both; it has a rich enough texture that its posts can refer back to themselves over say 15 year spans.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                <a href="{{gel}}">Andrew Gelman's blog</a> manages the contradictions effortlessly. He reacts to hundreds of new papers a year, but posts on a 9-month lag after writing. This allows him to uncouple from the reactive journalistic stuff, and lets us see if his take holds up. I have learned so much from it, and indeed it is an accumulating, long-term project: it documents his shift towards understanding the deep problems in large parts of academic science.
            </li>

            <li>
                Cosma Shalizi's <a href="{{shal1}}">notebooks</a> + <a href="{{shal2}}">book</a> <a href="{{shal3}}">reviews</a> + <a href="{{shal4}}">one-offs</a> were deeply inspiring to me, though he has slowed down a little in the last 5 years.

            <li>
                Nassim Taleb has for 15 years maintained <a href="{{nnt}}">a single page(!)</a> with 160 entries all loosely tied to the idea of 'opacity' or systemically unobservable factors in all kinds of domains.
