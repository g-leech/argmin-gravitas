	<li><li>Famously, postmodernists are opaque, insular, abstract, technical and pseudotechnical, nested, and wilfully indeterminate.</li>
	<li><li>Critics claim this indicates intellectual fraud and conceptual confusion. This is no doubt somewhat true in many cases.</li>
	<li><li>However, not always. What counts as "clear" depends on shared cultural assumptions, mere frequency, power structures, and familiarity with dominant discourse...</li>
	<li><li>Maybe some challenging ideas are intrinsically difficult to express: (a) familiar language recirculates existing preconceptions, (b) linguistic transparency falsely suggests neutral, objective meaning transmission, and (c) maybe you sometimes need to make readers struggle, e.g. to force awareness of their own interpreting.</li>
	<li><li>Alternative explanations besides fraud: specialists develop jargon naturally; philosophical projects genuinely attempting to destabilize fixed meanings must perform that destabilization; increasing insularity is common across most academic fields.</li>
	<li>Maybe it's a methodological choice that some people should make.</li>
