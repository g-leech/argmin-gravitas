Dreadful bloody pseudoscience in the abscessed vein of Freud. Blames schizophrenia on strict parenting and then celebrates its completely disabling horror.

One good thing though: his idea of "ontological insecurity" as a distinctive debilitating state. I've met someone with a real case of this (a philosophical case) and it was as bad as you'd expect. But I doubt Laing ever did.

Terribly written, with the glib say-what-you're-going-to-say structure, cod psychology and thoughtless overreach common in social theory.

<blockquote>
Japan retreated into a state of denial... Can a nation's [unacknowledged] past make its people ill, in the same way as repressed memories make individuals ill?</blockquote>


No and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressed_memory#Criticism">no</a> <a href="http://bfms.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Brandon_report.pdf">they don't</a>. But he gives a brief and clear sketch from Edo to their World Cup; still helpful if you are a total novice like me. (Never knew the shogunate were the internationalists in the Meiji struggle!) Needless to say Goto-Jones is unable to step beyond C20th stereotypes - to note, for instance, that by time of writing Japan <a href="https://www.gwern.net/The%20Melancholy%20of%20Subculture%20Society#japan-and-the-internet">had likely stopped</a> being the place the future happens first.

<br>
Air guitar which thinks it’s on stage.

A stupid book - which would be fine, given the topic is pop music - but unfortunately it thinks it is clever. I haven’t seen anything this top-down processed and forced since I last read theology. 

I'm trying not to hold the subtitle against her, since it is unlikely she got to choose it. But since it is what it is and at the risk of stating the obvious: Diamanda Galas, Nico, Hope Nicholls, Patti Smith, Neko Case, Lisa Germano, Nina Hagen, Fiona Apple, Liz Phair, Lydia Lunch, Grace Jones, Bjork, Liz Frazer, Sinead O'Connor, Exene, Eleanor Friedberger, Laetitia Sadier, Skin Dyer, Kristen Hersh are far weirder than any of these popstars. 

Hard to think of a worse ending to this sentence:

<blockquote>my focus is on performers whose effect on the body is hot, explosive, and immediate, rather than those who adhere to typical standards of refinement and class, such as Grimes and Joanna Newsom</blockquote>


The (tiny, hollow) essays are extremely reminiscent of the lyric annotations on Genius: breathless pretences and projections onto commonplaces.

<blockquote>Society has become allergic to the sound of plaint in a woman’s voice, dismissing it as whiny privilege or a kind of homespun earnestness.</blockquote>



One funny consequence of Chow’s contrarianism (lauding the nasty, the tasteless, the fake, the cynical) is that she repeatedly implies that her beloved subjects suck:

<blockquote>The artists in this book deal in moods that are generally considered undesirable: an insistent fakeness, emotional dishonesty, uncontrolled sexuality, strident superficiality. Their music tends to grate rather than soothe

This book is an argument for the cheap, the shrill, the coarse, the sour, the pungent, the saccharine: for any off-putting effect as long as it is memorable

Reviews will always praise artists who demonstrate coherent intelligence, yet pop’s distinction lies in its ability to shuck off sensible opinions.

she makes them creepy as no other young woman does, foreshadowing the hag behind today’s pop.
</blockquote>



She talks as if they were Throbbing Gristle. (Her subjects are mostly great! Not that you’d know from reading this. I am grateful to her for introducing me to Chinawoman.)

20 years ago this book would have been bold and contrarian and useful: poptimism was struggling to be born. Now that that monstrous child is a grown hegemon - these same artists get into the annual top tens in most hipster bastions - Chow seems like an obsequious courtier, haranguing us and telling us the actual queen is still, somehow, underrated.

<small>Antony Todd (2012)<br>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed May 2015<br></small>
<br>
Pompous and shallow, with less intellectual content than the Rotten Tomato summaries of the films, let alone the films. (“Chapter One: Towards a Textual Historicity.”) Wields critical-theory Freudian shite to justify writing a book without any real discussion of the films, or the films' themes, or even any real biographical aspersion of Lynch-as-seen-in-his-films. Instead there is second-hand gossip dressed up as historical context and post-structuralist intertextuality (“Jaussian reception theory”: the discussion of reviews,  ad campaigns, corporate manoeuvring). Materialism (in critical theory) is the position that both artwork and authors are irrelevant to the study of the artwork.

<blockquote>Let us, then, register modern auteurism in a reception practice whereby the authored film can compete for the reader’s attention in a coming together of inter- and extra-textual determinations through which the modern film spectator composes the aesthetic text for herself or himself...
</blockquote>



I’m not suggesting Todd is dishonest, or intentionally vague: instead, I think film studies has convinced him that shuffling these words around is intellectual work.

<blockquote>Note for your calibration of my opinion: I was very much looking forward to this book (because I find Lynch watchable but confusing), and so I fell far. Also it’s been a while since I read any academic Arts work that didn’t strike me as hollow and fatally decoupled from the work at hand. Let alone its coupling to the world. I will strive to cherry-pick in future.</blockquote>

Chatty, trite, and pretentious. ("Young people are stupid", "disabled people should stop moping".) It is at least trying to process the philosophy's thick and styleless abstractions into an accessible intro, but ends up being childish, macho, and uncritical. 

He's a tenured academic, too! Taken as systematic description of the real world, Existentialism is a fruitless neo-Kantian mess. Taken as extreme postwar poetry or stoic-<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictionalism/">fictionalist</a> cognitive stance, it is perhaps beautiful in a way.

<br>
I recently learned a fundamental dichotomy in expressing oneself: you use either the '<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5317066/2007-esoteric-writing-pedagogy.pdf">esoteric</a>' or the '<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/hanson-joins-cu.html">exoteric</a>' mode. (The exoteric writer says exactly what she means, minimises ambiguity and tries to do everything with explicit reasoning, for the largest audience they can, with imagery and irony only as decoration. The esoteric writer – distinct from, but often coextensive with the woo-woo mystical metaphysics fans also called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esotericism">esoteric</a> – does the converse. 

Most ancient writers wrote esoterically, which is one reason that undergrads and other fools, like me, think that ancient writers are vague and low on content. Up to now, I have been confusing the rhetorical stance - see Heidegger, Deleuze, Derrida, Caputo - with the magickal crap. But so much of the Analytic / Continental divide can be explained in this single distinction! [The revival of the distinction is due to that lionized demon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_and_the_Art_of_Writing">Leo Strauss</a>.] Maths is an interesting border case, but its clarity and attempt to destroy ambiguity make it exoteric, I think.) 

The exoteric intention strikes me as firstly just good manners and important for intellectual honesty (accountability, critical clarity). But one thing I dislike about studying computer science is that all the materials are utterly exoteric. I crave art and irreverence in formal contexts, and those are always at least somewhat esoteric. The ‘Agile’ software thing strikes me as good, a way of making the hag-ridden and monstrously expensive dev process work. But all the material around Agile, LEAN (and the wider business-marketing-HR-systems theory blah that represents most employed adults’ only engagement with passably academic work) is so exoteric that something in me rebels.

<br>
<blockquote>I still did not understand why they have taken such a stand against the large and growing body of evidence showing that working memory and fluid intelligence can be increased through training.</blockquote>


(Because it mostly wasn't very good evidence, Dan.)

Gladwellian (i.e. chatty overinterpretation of immature social science) with a side dose of uninteresting self-experimentation. More than half of this is about brain training, which has unfortunately lost most of its scientific veneer in the five years since it was published. (<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1037/a0028228">Here are</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691616635612">some</a> <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1177/1529100616661983">large negative</a> <a href="https://www.gwern.net/DNB-meta-analysis#moderators">meta-analyses</a>.) To some extent this is not his fault - I did n-back for a while myself in 2013, and he cites all the top people (he's in love with credentials and committee memberships). But the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">crisis</a> made a mockery of many top people. They crowed about lifting the 'curse of learning specificity' (that no training regime seems to produce a general increase in fluid intelligence). The curse has since reasserted its gloom. 

He makes dozens of errors of interpretation (for instance, the Abecedarian preschool programme which he enthuses about made no long-term intelligence gains; for instance not distinguishing active and passive controls). And he gives no attention to the biggest interventions, quality sleep and education (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618774253">3 points per year</a>(!)). Also, music instruction for cognition didn't replicate. 

Serves me right for reading a journalist on any topic but journalism, I suppose. He gives, I think, only one effect size, despite citing hundreds of studies in prose. There's only one moment where he does actual journalism and pushes back against the hasty commercialisation of immature science. 

Useful as an example of how not to write about science; about the spurious <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/03/03/more-on-replication-crisis/">omnicausal</a> implications of low-power psychology studies; as a reminder that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence (and anything nonmedical to do with Gf gains is extraordinary); and maybe if you're interested in verbatim conference backbiting.

His self-experiment is invalidated before it starts (even as an n-of-one thing) because he decides to wake up early (again, the cognitive penalty of 2 fewer hours of sleep dwarfs the boosters' estimates of brain training + exercise + nicotine):

<blockquote>I... wrote out my training schedule. I would wake up at 6:00 a.m. instead of my usual 8:00 a.m.
</blockquote>



His lowest moment: Trying to understand the balance of evidence about brain training and g, Hurley's meta-analytic method is to literally count the studies that found, or didn't find, a significant effect:

<blockquote>In the years following publication [of the original n-back study], a grand total of four randomized, controlled studies have been published finding no benefit of cognitive training... Yet in contrast, by my count, seventy-five other randomized, controlled studies have now been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals confirming that cognitive training substantially improves.
</blockquote>


He tries to critique the 2013 meta-analysis, but is unable to, because he doesn't know how to estimate study quality, and crapness matters far more than quantity.

How to avoid finding ourselves in Hurley's position? Well, first off avoid writing a book about any young social science (n-back was 11 years old when he wrote this so the rule might have to be "more than a couple of decades old"). The lack of consensus (in a relatively nonpoliticised field) is another warning sign: not because science is quick at resolving bullshit disagreements, but because it means the effects can't be very large, are hiding in <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2015/04/21/feather-bathroom-scale-kangaroo/">the background noise</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogmed">surprisingly large</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumosity">amounts of money</a> the findings spurred probably didn't help with confirmation bias and hostility. Listen to the grumpy bastards (Randy Engle, mocked as a "defender of the [specificity] faith" in this, was right all along). Lastly, read the methodologists: <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.200.7648&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Paul Meehl</a> and others were warning us of the general statistical shoddiness of psychology more than forty years ago.

It's an important topic and he actually navigates the tricky nicotine vs tobacco literature well (spoiler: <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nicotine">it's really good</a>). But <a href="https://www.gwern.net/DNB-meta-analysis">read</a> <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics">Gwern</a> and <a href="https://examine.com/search/?q=nicotine">Examine</a> instead.

At first I was very taken by Dobelli’s article ‘<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli">Why you shouldn’t read news</a>’, and still think there’s something to it (particularly as goes news' inevitable over-dramatisation of reality via availability bias and our <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:F3fAKhlyOZgJ:www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/Gillbert%2520(How%2520Mental%2520Systems%2520Believe).PDF+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk">inbuilt credulity</a>), but it’s all Taleb’s work, except unjustified and not actually good. 

(Consider that one is to free-ride and, in the hypothetical aggregate of a trend of people quitting news, suppress journalism’s deterrent effects on governmental and business malfeasance.) 

Anyway his Art is neither well-organised or well-conceptualised – he stretches the perhaps 20 reputable cognitive biases of Kahneman et al into 99 anecdotal smirks. (Redundancies: he splits illusion of control and action bias, the paradox of choice and decision fatigue...) Consider the ‘It’s-gotta-get-worse-before-it-gets-better effect’. 

The big problem for the heuristics and biases program is when you get contradictory pairs of biases – how can people be both ? The actual researchers have done well in synthesising these and providing base-rates for effect sizes (without which, the programme is little more than a new way for intellectuals to insult each other). Dobelli offers no classification, effect sizes, or even citations (they’re hidden online), just clomping informational candy. 

Taleb for dummies. (Where Taleb is already Kahneman for drama queens.)

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259244">"The Bald Prima Donna: A Pseudo-Play in One Act"</a></h3>

<small>Eugène Ionesco (1958)<br>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Sep 2016<br></small>
<br>
Almost unmitigated shite. I suppose it might be just a satire of hollow, SO RANDOM surrealism? But apparently not - and either way it is not a good play. Plus a half for its structure (a continuous loop with new characters substituted in, taking on the same mannerisms and follies); plus a virtual half for maybe losing its wit in translation. 

I cannot remember the last time I binned a book (rather than risk anyone else wasting their time).

<small>Jean Racine, Douglas Dunn (1990)<br>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Jul 2018<br></small>
<br>
Epic verse always sounds too pat to me, and doubly so when forced to fit dialogue: mumming couples expositing couplets. (“I’ll kill myself. That final ploy shall save / My honour. Then I’ll give back from the grave / What I owe Pyrrhus.”) Not Dunn’s fault – the pentameter’s solid. 

And he agrees: “It was a bloody hard piece of work… and I think it was universally agreed that I didn’t fully succeed.”

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57945316">"Babel"</a></h3>

<small>R.F. Kuang (2022)<br>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Apr 2023<br></small>
<br>
Harry Potter for spelling bee kids with loud politics. Very smooth, very twee, very modish, very fond of linguistics qua linguistics, but not very anything else. The Wordsworth epigrams are a good spiritual fit.

The magic system (Translation IS Magic) doesn't interest me, though the core rule - power stemming from binding Chinese and English words together and playing off the different connotations - is a satisfying enough image. The enchanted silver is shown as incredibly powerful, but also completely inert - it doesn't change British history or economy at all, because that would mess with the political message.

I can't put my finger on exactly how Kuang's prose blares "2020s". (See also Seanan McGuire or NK Jemisin.) An incomplete portrait: it's flat, states everything explicitly, lots of dialogue where people say out loud what they are feeling right this second. Special children with lots of agency in a cartoonishly evil society. Plenty of diversity, but all the categories and language and sentiments are imported directly from our moment and not fit into the fantasy at all. No <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk7M2jGdnxU">subtext</a>. It has political Thoughts which it realises it cannot just say in the first chapter, but they're poorly hidden, so the resulting twist is visible 300 pages early. It's easy to read, but anachronistic.

<blockquote>"Innocent? Is that what our father told you?" ...

"Diē" he said again. Then a laugh escaped his throat: hysterical, helpless, because it was so very funny, so apt that the romanization of father contain the same letters for death in English" </blockquote>


Probably this is just the young adult style being transported into old adult lit, possibly because it sells better.

She adopts a scholarly schtick, a clumsy preface and didactic asides. Most of it seems accurate to my limited knowledge - but then she says

<blockquote>Here [villain] forgets that chattel slavery... is a wholly European invention</blockquote>

 which is just breathtakingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_the_Muslim_world">false</a> (assuming "chattel" is the legal, permanent, hereditary, forced, exclusive, race-based, hard labour, nonreligious, nonmilitary, market type of slavery which the Transatlantic trade shared with the much older Arab trade). It's a common enough (motivated) mistake in academia, but still an indictment of her historical knowledge.

It's not pure polemic though - in Lovell she captures a hint of the honest obsession of the imperialist scholars, that whole archaeologist / classicist / orientalist / explorer / philologist complex which rediscovered, inferred, and nicked so much. And she's conflicted about the use of violence by the oppressed. And in fact the real-life British Empire was occasionally exactly as cartoonishly evil as this.

Luckily Jonathan Strange exists already.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/396488">"The Alexandria Quartet"</a></h3>

<small>Lawrence Durrell (1962)<br>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Mar 2019<br></small>
<br>
Intolerable Sadean pondering about the sssensuality and yet! also Spirituality of the Orient. (The only way to make de Sade more boring is to add in kabbalah and the new age.) Durrell's prose is good, even - just the lightest touch of experimentality over classicism - but the sighing Art of it all made it impossible to go further than a hundred pages.

Suddenly I see wholesomeness, wit and concision in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2297137275">The Magus</a>. So Durrell is the real magician.

I liked the gag at the end of Justine - there's a sentence regarding everything, man, but the footnote for that sentence points at a completely and intentionally blank page. Oh but it wasn't a gag, it was a deep reflection of being and nonbeing. Fuck it then.

This was the only book I had on me for several hours and I still couldn't hack it. I rather stared at the wall.

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1150202">"Gender: Key Concepts in Philosophy"</a></h3>

<small>Tina Chanter (2007)<br>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;<br>reviewed Apr 2013<br></small>
<br>
Annoying: conventionally unconventional. I've been looking for a good introduction; this is not that. 

(Is it a coincidence that the best popularisers - Paglia, Greer, Moran - are all highly problematic?) 

Chanter manages to make exciting parts of feminism - e.g. Calhoun's post-deconstruction stuff - sound dull, dense and theoretically empty, as if it were the same kind of navel-gazing theorism as the hyperinflated Althusserian-Foucauldian stuff. (To be fair, <em>any</em> overview has to cover French theory, because that's what our counter-gender people have actually been up to<em> for decades</em>. But not blind acceptance.) 

You get the impression, here, that progress in feminist thought consists in calling your predecessors bigoted - JS Mill calls out the Victorians, Okin calls out JS Mill, Butler calls out Okin, Wittig calls out Butler, and then Calhoun calls <em><a href="http://www.glbtq.com/literature/wittig_m.html">Wittig</a></em> heteronormative.
