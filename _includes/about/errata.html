	I offer bounties for errors:<br><br>

	<ul>
		<li>$1 for nitpicks (ambiguities, misreadings, exceptions, technicalities).</li>
		<li>$10 for an error which falsifies a sentence.</li>
		<li>$50 for an error which invalidates a post.</li>
	</ul>

			I suppose this should all be multiplied by the confidence level of the post. Factual and logical errors are most likely to resolve cleanly; I probably won't cough up if you just tell me I'm an idiot for believing or not believing in e.g. Meinongianism. That would get a smile. <br><br>
			I'm not sure how to handle claims that have <i>changed</i> truth-value since I made them; half of this blog might be false if you return in 30 years. Leaning towards $1 to $5.<br><br>
