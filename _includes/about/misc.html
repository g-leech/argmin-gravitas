			It is equally fatal to the spirit to have a system and to not have one. <br>So you must combine the two.

		<blockquote>
			...there is in men and women a motivation stronger even than love or hatred or fear. It is that of being <span style="font-weight:bold">interested</span> — in a body of knowledge, in a problem, in a hobby, in tomorrow’s newspaper.

	<h3>Site</h3>
	<div>
		I love making this site better. I'm no designer but I enjoy the result. <a href="/colophon">Here's a list of my design decisions.</a><br><br>

		The title alludes to <i><a href="{{Cult}}">Iain Banks</a></i>: his powerful protagonists tease pompous people by taking names with as little <i>gravitas</i> as possible. To take the <i><a href="{{Arg}}">arg min</a></i> of something is to find the thing which results in its lowest value.

	<h3>Conflicts of interest</h3>

			<li>I am funded by <a href="{{engsci}}">UKRI</a> and so really by the British government.</li> 
			<li>I won an Emergent Ventures grant via Tyler Cowen.</li>
			<li>I own half of Arb Research which has dozens of clients.</li>
			<li>ex: I received a small EA Infrastructure Fund grant to try and fix executive function (“<a href="{{offroad}}">Off Road</a>”).</li>
			<li>ex: Until 2019 I worked at AXA, a big insurer.</li> 
			<li>ex: My 2021 mask paper used compute donated by Microsoft.</li>

			DQ: A very nice website - links to the original papers, including participant numbers and number of citations... effect sizes and replications effect sizes.<br>
			JH: Very interesting, for a variety of reasons - and not just because it's fun to trawl through the wreckage... of 'those silly social scientists'. This [post] is a big old thing... much more comprehensive than anything I ever did... Not a lot of people would have the commitment to even try and organise something like this... You do get a sense of the enormity of [the replication crisis] which isn't really available through other documents...<br><br>
			DQ: What are the implications for how we actually teach first year psych?<br>

	<h3>Identity</h3>
	<div>
		I try not to identify as things. My premises, projects and preferences say overwhelmingly more about me than my social identity does. 
	</div>


	<h3>Tone</h3>
	<div>
		I'm sometimes told I'm too strident. I'll accept this, because constant hedging is unreadable, more annoying than authoritativeness. Also because strong claims galvanise opposition: as long as they're reasonable as well as strong, hopefully this stimulus creates value.<br><br>
		
		Anyway I'm not as sure as I sound: there's a comment box under every piece, call me out. 
	</div>



	<h3>Why so many quotations?</h3>
	<div>
		<a href="{{quot}}">Well, they're the densest store of insight</a>. We are not empiricists by nature or by culture, so they are my concession to the apeish narrative side of mind. That quotes page is like a message digest of 10 years of me reading and learning. 

		<br><br>I sometimes regret my instinctual distrust of Twitter: a lot of <a href="{{Gwern}}">contemporary</a> <a href="{{Dril}}">aphorists</a> must be whiling away the years on there.<br><br>
	</div>

	<h3>System</h3>

	<h3>Metrics</h3>
	<div>
		<a href="{{metrics}}">Here are scales</a> for rating all kinds of things.
	</div>


	<h3>Loss function</h3>
	<div>Above all I hope to beat the trend spotted <a href="{{Doom}}">by Robin Hanson</a> about independent scholars:<br><br>
		<blockquote>over time amateurs blow their lead by focusing less and relying on easier, more direct methods. They rely more on informal conversation as analysis method, they prefer personal connections over open competitions in choosing people, and they rely more on a perceived consensus among a smaller group of fellow enthusiasts. As a result, their contributions just don’t appeal as widely or as long.</blockquote>

	</div>


	<h3>Illnesses</h3>
	<div>
		I suffer from degenerative <a href="{{telo}}">DNA scrambling</a>, <a href="{{lazy}}">increasingly lazy cells</a>, irreversible <a href="{{methyl}}">methylation</a>, <a href="{{tang}}">terribly tangled proteins</a>, disappearing <a href="{{nic}}">stem-cell nooks</a>, and ultimately <a href="{{oxy}}">oxygen poisoning</a>, like everyone.

	<h3>What's with all these accordions?</h3>
	<div>
		<a href="{{Hide}}">Information hiding</a> is a basic condition of good large software; these accordions are a prose analogue. The hope is that, by tucking away wires, I can write long things without triggering anyone's TL;DR reflex.<br><br> 

		It also sort of simulates a dialogue with the reader: I plant a question, and then they prompt for the response.
