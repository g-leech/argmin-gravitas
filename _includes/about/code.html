<div>

I've been employed to code for <a href="{{yearsCode}}">{{fullYearsSince}}</a> years <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a>. Of which, I've done ML engineering or research for {{dsYears}} years.<br><br> 

It is some career. So far I have worked on a precision methadone pump, a website generator for bed & breakfasts, secure off-site credit card storage, procurement streamlining for e.g. 'aerospace' companies, a metre-precise 3D model of Britain's rivers, a performance dashboard for use by secondary school teachers, medical risk scoring models, countermeasures against machine-learning model extraction...<br><br>

I fell in love with the technical quite late. I was working for the stats department of the Scottish Government and watching the local longbeard run something simple like PCA on childhood poverty data. Here was something which didn't rely on the assumptions of the humans using it (or really not many anyway). Here was a way out of the endless woods of philosophy - or rather, a way to a superior philosophy, beyond merely verbal philosophy.

<br><br>

More superficially, I was blown away when I saw the gov's sysadmins slouching through the crowd of suits in their Behemoth and Orange Goblin t-shirts. <i>There</i> was power, enough to ignore irrelevances and puffery.

<br><br>

I now do "research", which means I <a href="/gist">rarely</a> write anything more than a script or maybe a few gnarly stats functions. Besides <a href="{{gh}}">this</a>!<br><br><br><br>

	<!-- <h3>Origin story</h3>
	<div>
		<ul>
			I've been a paperboy, a Beijing dogsbody, a gender development volunteer, a bookseller, an Excel drone, a SAS drone, a social researcher, a database developer (Access / Sharepoint), a MEAN developer, a C# developer, a PHP developer, a frontend developer, and a data scientist.<br>
			
			<br><span style="font-weight:bold">2014</span>
				<li>My first language was SAS / SQL, learned on the job. You never go back after tasting real interface. <a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18">18</a></li>
				<li>Got Ubuntu, wiresharked my buddy's IP.</li>
				<li>Conversion Master's degree in software. Java, relational theory, binary, hex, MC6800, Python, HTK, crypto, the radical uncertainty of <a href="{{safety}}">safety-critical code</a>. Thesis on computational (para)linguistics.</li>
				<br><br>
				
			<br><span style="font-weight:bold">2015</span>
				<li>Bluffed my way into a databasing internship two months into that. </li>
				<li>Got a real dev job in a wee startup immediately after, despite being open about my ignorance.</li>
				<li>They ran out of money, so I paid my dues: worked on a legacy PHP codebase for a year.</li>
				<li>Built a Linux box from scratch.</li>
				<li>Got on with a second undergrad in maths.</li>
				<br><br>

			<br><span style="font-weight:bold">2016</span>
				<li>Tried remote working, Angular, Typescript and the strange airless Microsoft dev stack. Frontend.</li>
				<li>Tired of making websites, got a data science post in the City. Modelling with actuaries, data janitoring, Spark cluster work, dogsbody handywork.</li>
				<br><br>

			<br><span style="font-weight:bold">2017</span>
				<li>Started to internalise it all.</li>
				<li>Wrote a link archiver, enthusiastically.</li>
				<li>Started functional programming with that Odersky Scala course. Buzzing.</li>
				<li>Mined Hanson's <i>Age of Em</i> for propositions.</li>
