	  <div class="insides">
		My background is mixed: a lot of philosophy, a bit of economics, a bit of stats, a bit of computer science, a bit of computational linguistics, a bit of epidemiology, a bit of literary criticism. But in research, much depends on you mastering one thing or one cluster of things.<br><br>So I am trying to become less rounded. This boils down to more maths. One carrot: I aim to fully understand the great explanations: set theory, measure theory, relativity, QM, evolutionary dynamics, Bayes, reinforcement learning, and computational complexity.
