	    Early on, ENIAC claimed the title "first computer" by default, because the others were destroyed by carpet bombing or hidden by classified status. It did large amounts of useful work, computing solutions to nuclear physics problems. (Though the Colossi were hardly toys either.)<br><br>

	    This claim may also be due to national chauvinism, since computer science, as a self-aware field, was pioneered in American universities.<br><br>

	    Testable implications of nationalism: see if definitions of "computer" vary by country. In Germany, where the great mechanical and electromechanical devices were made, you might expect more of the rarefied abstract nonelectronic idea of computation. In America, where universal electronic computation was done first, you should see an emphasis on electricity and performance.<br><br>

		Where "complex" is just "having intermediate steps between input and output".<br><br>

		I added "inorganic" to exclude chimpanzees or octopi. Sorry.

		<a href="{{coloss}}">Benjamin Wells has shown</a> that ten Colossi working together(!) could have approximated a universal Turing machine. I honestly don't know whether to count this. (It's certainly more <i>physical</i> work than has to be done to make the Z3 Turing-complete...)
