<h3>"Automatically"</h3>
<p class="def">
	Acting without external intervention, after specifying input and program. I'm treating this as the core property of 'a computer'. An abacus is not a computer, because it doesn't do any operations for you. The Ishango bone, as far as anyone can tell, is also not a computer. A slide rule makes you do the intermediate steps and so isn't a computer. <br>
</p>
<br>

<h3>"Calculator"</h3>
<p class="def">
	A distinction is sometimes made between computers and mere calculators. For instance, Zuse's Z3 is sometimes said to be an '<a href="{{calc}}">electronic calculator</a>', and not a computer per se. This distinction does not have a physical basis. <br><br>

	I think their point is to make universal computation a necessary condition of being 'a computer' - but this condition would disqualify archetypal computers like the ABC and Colossus. So it doesn't fit. <br><br>

	For my purposes, a calculator is a computer: a special-purpose (arithmetic) computer. So we can talk about the ancient analogue devices and Babbage's inspired flight of general-purpose imagination in the same article.

<h3>"Programmable"</h3>
<p class="def">
	Can you change what it computes, without altering the gross structure of the processor?	(Mechanical calculators are nonprogrammable computers, on this account.)<br><br>

		<h3>Flight of fancy (retracted)</h3>
		<div>
			<i>This section misunderstands the nature of Peano arithmetic and would take some work to salvage. Calculators doing arithmetic may well be mirroring certain nonarithmetic Turing machines, but this is usually not a sensible use of "reasoning about" or "encoding".</i><br><br>

			However <a href="{{baasic}}">basic computability theory</a> throws a spanner at this definition, because Peano arithmetic can reason about Turing machines. So calculators (which have addition and multiplication) can be made to program other things after all. So 'nonprogrammable' calculators are programmable in a stronger sense than they are not.
			<br><br>
 			I need to specify something else as the criterion, to preserve the extension. "Not programmable without simulation"? "Without metamathematical encoding"? "Efficiently"? "Without being a smartass"? These options turn to ashes in my mouth.)
 		</div>
 	</div>

	<br>"Programmable" is sometimes used to mean "general-purpose". Actually GP computers are a subset of programmable computers: they're the ones that can be programmed to do '<a href="{{computable}}">anything</a>'.<br><br> 

	(Even worse, "program-controlled" is sometimes used to mean punch-card / plug-wire programming, as opposed to "stored-program-controlled", for instance in <a href="{{flow}}">this</a> other attempt to downgrade the Z3.)
</p>
<br>


<h3>"General-purpose"</h3>
<p class="def">
	If the device had unlimited time (and memory), could it simulate a <a href="{{utm}}">Universal Turing machine</a>; could it compute all that can be computed?
