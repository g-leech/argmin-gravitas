		No. Here are some big candidates:<br><br>
		
		<ol>
			<li>The <a href="{{Antikythera}}">Antikythera mechanism</a> is the first known computer, probably built around 100 BCE. It was 'just' a 'calculator' (see below).</li><br>

			<li>Honourable mention of <a href="{{vinci}}">da Vinci's functional design</a> (c. 1500) of a mechanical calculator.</li>
			<br>

			<li>Honourable mention of Charles Babbage and his unbuilt <a href="{{enjinn}}">Analytical Engine</a>: if he had had about 10 times more money, he might well have built the first general-purpose digital machine around 1850.</li><br>

			<li>Honourable mention of Percy Ludgate and his partial design of a 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Ludgate">Analytical Machine</a>.
			</li><br>

			<li>Honourable mention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide-predicting_machine#The_Kelvin_machine">Kelvin machine</a>, an analogue tide predictor.</li><br>

			<li>Honourable mention of Torres y Quevedo and his analogue special-function calculators 
				and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Torres_Quevedo#Analytical_machines">keyboard-operated calculator</a>.
			</li><br>

			<li>The <a href="{{Z3}}">Z3</a> (operational on 7th December 1941) was the first general-purpose digital machine to execute a program successfully. (Its inventor, Konrad Zuse, also rediscovered Shannon's <a href="{{shannon}}">great breakthrough</a> and much else besides.)</li><br>

			<li>The <a href="{{colossus}}">Colossus Mark I</a> (operational on 8th December 1943) was the first fully-electronic programmable digital computer. It was 'just' a '5KHz logic calculator'.  <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a></li><br>

			<li>The <a href="{{ENIAC}}">ENIAC</a> (operational by November 1945) was the first fully-electronic general-purpose digital computer.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a> Google's foolish truncation of this specification led to me doing all the research for this piece.  </li><br>

			<li>The <a href="{{Baby}}">Manchester Baby</a> (operational by June 1948) was the first fully-electronic, general-purpose digital computer to successfully execute a 'stored program', a set of instructions loaded into its own memory as data. There are mixed reports of a heavily modified ENIAC executing one in April or else September 1948; <a href="{{cope}}">Copeland</a> notes that this was the most limited sense of stored program, but should probably still count if someone can track down the April records.</li>

			<li>"The [Apollo Guidance Computer] was the first silicon integrated circuit based computer."</li>

	<h3>Other questions</h3>
	<div>
		<p style="font-weight:bold">How many first computers are there?</p>

		My crude model (which has eight boolean variables and three ternary variables), implies that there are up to 2304 <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a> first computers out there. I have only bothered to identify <a href="{{myData}}">45</a> of them. Who's pedantic now?<br><br><br>


		<p style="font-weight:bold">What about newer first computers?</p>

		I am not even counting developments after 1970. You could also add "synchronous/asynchronous", "networked" (...), uni/multiprocessing", classical/quantum", <a href="{{Flynn}}">Flynn's four streams</a>, input (e.g. first keyboard), a fourth value for physical medium (to capture the near-future "optical" computing, or momentum computing)... Above all you'd also want "mass-produced" and a huge sliding scale for "portability".<br><br><br>


		<p style="font-weight:bold">What does stored program really mean?</p>

		6 different things, as detailed <a href="{{cope}}">here</a>. Turing invented four of them first, Zuse another, and von Neumann another. Mostly independent. The ENIAC implemented the most limited form first or second, then the Manchester Baby did the others. <br><br><br>
		


		<p style="font-weight:bold">Are shit computers still computers?</p>

		The Antikythera mechanism didn't work very well, because of a false astronomical theory and the crude engineering tolerances of the time. It probably systematically predicted planets to be a full 40 degrees off their real course. Nor could Leibniz's calculator carry through. <br><br>

		A lot of the specs are taken from the remarkable conference covered in <a href="{{Rojas}}">Rojas</a>. <a href="{{jaundice}}">John Morrice</a> wrote a Python decision tree which inspired my solution. The SVG icons are by <a href="{{feather}}">Feather</a>. I used the <a href="{{trans}}">Transcrypt</a> Python transpiler, but kind of wish I hadn't.

	<h3>The ENIAC question</h3>
	<div>
		The ENIAC was modified for stored programs in 1948. It was demoed <a href="https://epictechnologyforgreatjustice.weebly.com/eniac.html">in September '48</a>. Other noncontemporaneous sources claim April '48, which would put it before the Baby. If you care, the ENIAC's stored program was stored in ROM rather than main memory.<br><br>

		"Jennings said that ENIAC ran in this mode from April 1948, but Goldstine reported a later date: â€˜on 16 September 1948 the new system ran on the ENIAC'".<br><br>
		The retrocomputing expert <a href="https://www.righto.com/">Ken Shiriff</a> writes in to the blog:
		<blockquote>As for the specific dates of the ENIAC conversion, I'm going from "ENIAC in Action" page 164, which discusses the conversion in April. I haven't looked into it enough to have any confidence in the dates. As an aside, there seems to be much more controversy and conflict about everything related to ENIAC than I'd expect, about who did what and when. (Even between the people who worked on it.)<br><br>

		I find ENIAC interesting because it was clearly the first at something important, but it's very hard to determine what. My take is that it was the first computer that made others want to build a computer. Before ENIAC, various people built different computers, but these didn't really motivate others. Then ENIAC came along and the Moore School Lectures, and everyone started building computers. One puzzle here is how ENIAC succeeded at this when they did almost everything wrong architecturally. My hypothesis is that it boils down to economics and productivity. ENIAC (and other computers) were essentially competing against a room full of people with calculators. ENIAC was fast enough that it provided a significant advantage over manual calculations, as well as fast enough to do calculations that were previously impractical. This motivated the development of other computers in a way that the relay computers, Mark I, etc. didn't. The Colossus might have had this sort of impact, but nobody knew about it, so ENIAC had the impact. (I'm still developing my thoughts on this, so let me know what you think.)</blockquote>
