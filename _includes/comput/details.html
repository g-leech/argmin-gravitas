		No. Here are some big candidates:<br><br>
		
		<ol>
			<li>The <a href="{{Antikythera}}">Antikythera mechanism</a> is the first known computer, probably built around 100 BCE. It was just a 'calculator'.</li><br>

			<li>Honourable mention of <a href="{{vinci}}">da Vinci's functional design</a> (c. 1500) of a mechanical calculator.</li>
			<br>

			<li>Honourable mention of Charles Babbage and his unbuilt <a href="{{enjinn}}">Analytical Engine</a>: if he had had about 10 times more money, he might well have built the first general-purpose digital machine around 1850.</li><br>

			<li>The <a href="{{Z3}}">Z3</a> (operational on 7th December 1941) was the first general-purpose digital machine to execute a program successfully. (Its inventor, Konrad Zuse, also rediscovered Shannon's <a href="{{shannon}}">great breakthrough</a> and much else besides.)</li><br>

			<li>The <a href="{{colossus}}">Colossus Mark I</a> (operational on 8th December 1943) was the first fully-electronic programmable digital computer. It was just a '5KHz logic calculator'.  <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a></li><br>

			<li>The <a href="{{ENIAC}}">ENIAC</a> (operational by November 1945) was the first fully-electronic general-purpose digital computer.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a> Google's foolish truncation of this specification led to me doing all the research for this piece.  </li><br>

			<li>The <a href="{{Baby}}">Manchester Baby</a> (operational by June 1948) was the first fully-electronic, general-purpose digital computer to successfully execute a 'stored program', a set of instructions loaded into its own memory as data. There are mixed reports of a heavily modified ENIAC executing one in April or else September 1948; <a href="{{cope}}">Copeland</a> notes that this was the most limited sense of stored program, but should probably still count if someone can track down the April records.</li>

			<li>"The AGC was the first silicon integrated circuit based computer."</li>

	<h3>Other questions</h3>
	<div>
		<p style="font-weight:bold">How many first computers are there?</p>

		My crude model (which has eight boolean variables and three ternary variables), implies that there are up to 2304 <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a> first computers out there. I have only bothered to identify <a href="{{myData}}">45</a> of them. Who's pedantic now?<br><br><br>


		<p style="font-weight:bold">What about newer first computers?</p>

		I am not even counting developments after 1970. You could also add "synchronous/asynchronous", "networked" (...), uni/multiprocessing", classical/quantum", <a href="{{Flynn}}">Flynn's four streams</a>, input (e.g. first keyboard), a fourth value for physical medium: "optical" computing... Above all you'd also want "mass-produced" and a huge sliding scale of "portable".<br><br><br>


		<p style="font-weight:bold">What does stored program really mean?</p>

		6 different things, as detailed <a href="{{cope}}">here</a>. Turing invented four of them first, Zuse another, and von Neumann another. Mostly independent. The ENIAC implemented the most limited form first, then the Manchester Baby did the others. <br><br><br>
		


		<p style="font-weight:bold">Are shit computers still computers?</p>

		The Antikythera mechanism didn't work very well, because of a false astronomical theory and the crude engineering tolerances of the time. It probably systematically predicted planets to be a full 40 degrees off the real course. Nor could Leibniz's calculator carry through. <br><br>

	<h3>Data</h3>
	<div>
		<a href="{{myData}}">Here</a>. If you have corrections or additions, please <a href="{{issue}}">open an issue here</a>.<br><br> 

		A lot of the specs are taken from the remarkable conference covered by Rojas' <i><a href="{{Rojas}}">The First Computers</a></i>. <a href="{{jaundice}}">John Morrice</a> wrote a Python decision tree which inspired my solution. The SVG icons are by <a href="{{feather}}">Feather</a>. I used the <a href="{{trans}}">Transcrypt</a> Python transpiler, but kind of wish I hadn't.
	</div>

	<h3>TODO</h3>
	<div>
		The ENIAC was modified for stored programs in 1948. It was <a href="https://epictechnologyforgreatjustice.weebly.com/eniac.html">demoed in September '48</a>. Other sources claim April '48, which would put it before the Baby.

		"Jennings said that ENIAC ran in this mode from April 1948, but Goldstine reported a later date: ‘on 16 September 1948 the new system ran on the ENIAC'".
