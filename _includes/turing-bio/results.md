<h3>Begin with his achievements:</h3>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			1935: <i>Mathematical statistics</i>:<br> An independent proof of the Central Limit Theorem.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1935: <i>Group theory</i>:<br> <a href="http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/10">An extension</a> to a theorem of von Neumann's.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1936: <i>Mathematical logic</i>:<br> One of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing%27s_proof">all-time great papers</a>, an answer to Hilbert's halting problem and an elaboration of the incompleteness of all mathematics, <i>and</i> the formal statement of a single machine that can perform all computable work. (Schmidhuber thinks that Goedel (1931) deserves the credit for the first universal coding. I see the implicit sense in this, but it seems a stretch.)
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1936: <i>Computability theory</i>:<br> Same paper. Creator thereof.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1936: <i>Automata theory</i>:<br> Same paper. Creator thereof.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1936: <i>Computer engineering</i>:<br> Same paper. Inventor of (<a href="{{cope}}">several variants of</a>) the stored-program concept, the basis of all computers since 1950.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1937: <i>Group theory</i>:<br> Proof that general continuous groups cannot be approximated by finite groups.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1938: <i>Mathematical logic</i>:<br> Invention of ordinal logics, an attempt to handle incompleteness.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1938: <i>Analytic number theory</i>:<br> Algorithm ("Turing's method") for calculating values of the zeta-function.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1938: <i>Computer engineering and Mathematical methodology</i>:<br> <a href="http://www.turingarchive.org/viewer/?id=118&title=1">Design</a> of an analogue machine to approximate the zeroes of the zeta function.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1939: <i>Cryptanalysis</i>:<br> developed most of the logical methods used against Nazi Germany's naval cipher, Enigma. Including a new sort of indirect frequency analysis, "simultaneous scanning", search trees, an independent invention of Shannon's information entropy (as "Weight of evidence")...
		</li><br>
		<br>
		<li>
			1940: <i>Mechanical engineering</i>:<br> redesigned the Polish Bomba to handle the exponential explosion in the Enigma's state space.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1940: <i>Bayesian inference</i>:<br> independent reinvention of Bayes factors and the first approximation of what we would now call empirical Bayes estimation. IJ Good quite rightly calls Bayes factors, "Bayes-Turing factors". (Though it should be Laplace-Turing factors.)
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1941: <i>Statistics</i>:<br> independent invention of sequential analysis, for "Banburismus".
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1942: <i>Cryptanalysis</i>:<br> A hand-method for cracking the Lorenz cipher, "Turingery".
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1943: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/alan-turings-delilah#:~:text=The%20Bandwidth%20Theorem&text=The%20theorem%E2%80%94which%20expresses%20what,several%20thousand%20times%20a%20second">Independent discovery</a> of the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, after Whittaker but before Shannon.
		<li>
			1944: <i>Cryptography, audio engineering and electrical engineering</i>:<br> Design, proof and much of the construction of "Delilah", a highly portable electronic speech encipherment device. This was never deployed and remained classified for decades. As such, we know that it was at least 10 years ahead of its time.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1945-6: <i>Algorithmics</i>:<br> The discovery of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">stack</a>. A neglected accomplishment. (Also subroutines, but Zuse had already implemented those.)
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1945-6: <i>Computer engineering</i>:<br> Design of the <a href="http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/C/32">Automatic Computing Engine</a>, the first complete design of a stored-program computer, including circuit diagrams, instruction set and cost estimate. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Draft_of_a_Report_on_the_EDVAC">von Neumann's</a> is incomplete.)
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1948: <i>Computer music</i>:<br> The first computer music. Turing's handbook for the Mark I had a section on using it to produce notes, and they gave <a href="https://soundcloud.com/guardianaustralia/first-ever-recording-of-computer-music">a demo for radio in 1951</a>, also a first. Not really a synth (not real-time) and not real electronic music (produced by moving parts).
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1948: <i>Linear algebra</i>:<br> <a href="http://www.turingarchive.org/viewer/?id=472&title=1">Better ways</a> of solving linear systems and inverting matrices.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1949: <i>Group theory</i>:<br> <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1969481?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Proof</a> that the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_for_groups">word problem</a>' is insoluable for cancellation semigroups. Computability mainstream in mathematics by then.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1949: <i>Formal verification</i>:<br> <a href="http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/b/8">Paper on</a> proving that computer programs will behave.
		</li><br>
		<br>
		<li>
			1950: <i>Philosophy of mind and artificial intelligence</i>:<br> His famous one, "Computing machinery and intelligence" is one of the <a href="http://explorer.opensyllabusproject.org/">top 100</a> set texts in philosophy, but <i>Computable Numbers</i> is the deeper contribution, outlining how computability limits what the brain can do, and how difficult it will be to redo. He sees machine learning coming very clearly.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1951: <i>Group theory</i>:<br> Another big result in the word problem for groups. (unpublished)
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1951: <i>Chess engine</i>:<br> <a href="http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/7">Published the first algorithm</a> to play a full game of chess automatically.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1952: <i>Mathematical biology</i>:<br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis">a profound chemical theory</a> of how life grows, now a textbook model of morphogenesis.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1952: <i>Number theory</i>:<br> Numerical evidence (computed on the Manchester Baby) for thousands of values of the zeta-function.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			1952: <i>Pattern formation</i>:<br> <a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/jhpd20/publications/after1952.pdf">Construction</a> of the "Swift-Hohenberg" equation, 23 years before them.
