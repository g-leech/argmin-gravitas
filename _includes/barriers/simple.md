Sometimes we just can't answer a question, even in principle. This is a list of the problems that can make that true:

<br>


<h3>Conceptual Problems: when the question is broken</h3>

<i>A malformed question or category error</i> occurs when you ask for something that doesn't make sense. Questions like "what colour is justice?" or "is sigmoid jealous of ReLU?" fail because they apply properties to things that can't have those properties. Justice isn't the sort of thing that has colour, and mathematical functions don't have emotions. Similarly, asking about "absolute time" or "absolute coordinates" presupposes a framework (Newtonian absolute space and absolute time) that doesn't correspond to physical reality.<br><br>

<i>Strong incommensurability</i> happens when a question tries to mix incompatible theoretical frameworks. For instance, you can't ask about "the Einsteinian mass of phlogiston" because phlogiston doesn't exist in any framework that includes Einsteinian physics, and you can't ask about "the wavefunction of this classical field" because classical fields don't have wavefunctions. The question assumes you can translate concepts between frameworks that are mutually exclusive.<br><br>

<i>Vagueness</i> means the question doesn't pick out anything specific enough to answer. "When exactly did you become an adult?" has no precise answer because "adult" is a vague category: there's no single moment where you transition from non-adult to adult. The concept has fuzzy boundaries that make the question unanswerable in its exact form.<br><br>

<i>False assumptions</i> render a question unanswerable because, while the question is grammatically clear and seems to make sense, it presupposes something false. "Have you stopped beating your wife?" can't be answered yes or no if you never beat your wife in the first place. Similarly, "Is personality based on nature or nurture?" presupposes a false dichotomy, when the reality involves complex interactions between both.<br><br>


<h3>Logical Problems: when no answer exists</h3>

<i>Antinomy</i> occurs when a question is self-referential or circular in a way that prevents any consistent answer. "Is this sentence false?" can't be true (because then it would be false as it claims) and can't be false (because then it would be true). The structure of the question itself creates a logical impossibility.<br><br>

<i>Incompleteness</i> and <i>undefinability</i> are fundamental limits which only come up in heavily formalised questions. You can't prove that Peano arithmetic is consistent using only Peano arithmetic itself, and you can't define arithmetic truth within arithmetic. For deep reasons, these kinds of question are impossible to answer when you're using any formal system powerful enough to be useful.<br><br>

<i>Mathematical independence</i> means a question is neither provable nor disprovable from your chosen axioms. Whether the continuum hypothesis is true can't be decided within standard set theory (ZFC). The statement might be true in some models of ZFC and false in others. Similarly, certain values like the busy beaver number BB(7910) are independent of ZFC, meaning no proof can establish their value within that system.<br><br>

<i>Anthropic self-locating effects</i> create unanswerable questions because your very existence as an observer depends on certain conditions being true. You can't determine the probability you're a Boltzmann brain (a spontaneous fluctuation that created your current conscious state) because if you were one, you'd still observe exactly what you observe now. Your existence selects for certain observations, making the underlying probability inaccessible.<br><br>

<i>Non-uniqueness</i> is when multiple equally valid answers exist. It's only a problem when you're demanding a single correct answer. The electromagnetic potential at a point isn't uniquely determined because you can add any gradient of a scalar function without changing the physics. The question "what is the electromagnetic potential?" thus has infinitely many correct answers, not because we're ignorant, but because the quantity itself isn't uniquely defined.<br><br>


<h3>Ontic Problems: when the answer is physically inaccessible</h3>

<i>Uncomputability</i> means no computer or mind, regardless of time or memory, can provide an answer. You can't write a program that determines if an arbitrary program will halt, or if an arbitrary Diophantine equation has integer solutions. They're provably impossible to solve algorithmically. Asking "is this sequence truly random?" is uncomputable because there's no algorithm that can verify true randomness.<br><br>

<i>Computational intractability</i> means the answer exists and is computable in principle, but would require more time than is physically available, even if you converted the entire universe into a computer. Optimal scheduling problems with all constraints, or cracking a well-encrypted file, are solvable in principle but require checking so many possibilities that they're effectively impossible. The difference from uncomputability is that these problems could be solved with enough resources; they're just practically impossible.<br><br>

<i>Inapproximability</i> is worse: even finding an approximate answer takes too long. For some problems like finding maximum cliques in graphs or chromatic numbers, you can't even get close to the answer in reasonable time.<br><br>

<i>Quantum indeterminacy</i> (on some interpretations of quantum mechanics) means physics is fundamentally random, so there's no answer to questions about individual quantum events. "When will this radium atom decay?" has no answer because the decay is genuinely random, not merely unpredictable due to our ignorance. The universe itself hasn't determined when it will happen until it actually happens.<br><br>

<i>Physical constraints, speed limits, and no-go theorems</i> make certain questions unanswerable because of fundamental physical laws. Information beyond your cosmological horizon is forever inaccessible because space itself is expanding faster than light can travel. You can't measure a quantum state in two incompatible bases simultaneously, and you can't build a perfectly accurate interferometer because of quantum limits on measurement precision.<br><br>

<i>Mixing</i> means the information you need to answer is irreversibly lost because the process erases fine details. If you want to know the exact microstate of the gas molecules in your room an hour ago, that information is gone. The system has thermalised, and the microscopic details have been scrambled into macroscopic averages that can't be reversed.<br><br>

<i>Non-ergodicity</i> is the opposite problem: the system doesn't mix, so it can't explore all possible states and reach equilibrium. Glass is a classic example. "What equilibrium will this glassy system reach?" may have no answer because the system is trapped in a local configuration and will never reach the global equilibrium, even given infinite time.<br><br>


Measurement Problems:<br>

<i>Disturbance or decoherence</i> means your measuring instruments mess with what you're measuring. In quantum mechanics, any measurement strong enough to extract information collapses the quantum state. You can use weak measurements to minimise this, but you can never eliminate the disturbance entirely. The act of observation changes what you're observing.<br><br>

<i>Complementarity</i> is when we can't answer it because the answer was excluded by another question we asked first. Measuring one property precisely makes it impossible to measure a second property precisely. If you measure an electron's position very accurately, you necessarily disturb its momentum, making it impossible to answer "where is this electron and how much momentum does it have?" The two properties can't be simultaneously known with arbitrary precision.<br><br>


<h3>Epistemic Problems: when we can't get at the answer</h3>

<i>Underdetermination or unidentifiability</i> occurs when multiple different theories or explanations are all consistent with the available evidence. Is spacetime fundamentally Lorentzian? Which interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct? These questions might have answers, but the evidence we can gather doesn't distinguish between the alternatives. The data underdetermines the theory.<br><br>

<i>Chaos</i> means tiny uncertainties in initial conditions grow exponentially, making long-term prediction impossible. You can't predict where a double pendulum will be after 100 Lyapunov times (the characteristic timescale of exponential divergence) because you'd need to measure the initial conditions to impossible precision. Weather prediction fails beyond about two weeks for the same reason: accumulating uncertainties destroy predictive power. This is epistemic because there is an answer but we can never measure the initial conditions well enough.<br><br>

<i>Computational irreducibility</i> means there's no shortcut to the answer; you have to run the full process or simulation. For certain cellular automata or complex systems, predicting the state after many steps is just as hard as actually running the system for that many steps. There's no compressed description or formula; the answer is inseparable from the process of computation itself.<br><br>

<i>Hidden variables</i> are quantities that affect the system but can never be directly observed. In quantum mechanics (on some interpretations), you can't simultaneously know the values of non-commuting observables like spin in different directions. The question "what are the simultaneous values of σ</i>x and σ</i>z for this electron?" is unanswerable because these variables, if they exist, are hidden from observation.<br><br>

<i>Cognitive closure</i> is the hypothesis that humans might lack the cognitive capacity to understand certain problems, like a dog can't understand calculus. "What is it like to be a bat?" might be genuinely inaccessible because our cognitive architecture can't simulate bat consciousness. Quantum gravity might be another example: perhaps the correct theory exists but is too complex for human minds to grasp.<br><br>

<i>Cognitive bias</i> is irrational thinking patterns that prevent us from answering questions accurately. "How biased am I?" is nearly impossible to answer because your biases affect your assessment of your own biases. <br><br>

<i>The original "<i>epistemic barrier</i>" in philosophy is the supposed conceptual gap between the mind and the world. How can we know that our perceptions and thoughts correspond to reality when all we have direct access to is our own mental states? <br><br>


<h3>Confusing problems: when you can't tell if it's logic, physics, or epistemics</h3>

<i>Observer Effects:<br>

<i>Back action</i> in quantum mechanics is the act of measurement physically affecting the system in ways you can't correct for. "What's the pre-measurement spin of this electron?" may be unanswerable because the spin doesn't have a definite value until measured, and the measurement process itself creates the value. The quantum Zeno effect shows that continuous observation can even freeze a system's evolution entirely.<br><br>

<i>Semantic theory-dependence</i> means our observational vocabulary already assumes theoretical commitments that prejudge the answer. "What's the rest mass of an electron without assuming special relativity?" is problematic because the very concept of "rest mass" is defined within the framework of special relativity. You can't ask the question without importing the theoretical framework it presupposes.<br><br>

<i>Perceptual theory-dependence</i> is the idea that our perception is shaped by our theoretical expectations, so we can't observe "directly." What do electron tracks in a cloud chamber really look like? What does an fMRI scan show before applying the hemodynamic response model? Our observations are always already interpreted through theoretical lenses, making theory-independent observation impossible.<br><br>

<i>Future contingents</i> are questions about events that haven't happened yet and might not be determined in advance. "What lottery numbers will win next week?" has no answer yet if the lottery is truly random. On an indeterministic interpretation of physics, the future doesn't exist to be known. You just have to wait for it to happen.<br><br>

<i>Hysteresis</i> means the current state depends on the history of how you got there, so you need information about the past that may be unavailable. "What's the magnetic moment of this material at field strength H?" depends on the path you took through magnetic field space. "When will this old rope snap?" depends on its entire stress history. Without that historical information, you can't answer the question.<br><br>

<i>Reflexivity and strange loops</i> occur when the thing you're asking about is self-referential (or changes when you try to answer the question). "What's the best method for finding the best method?" creates infinite regress. "Which level of description is fundamental in this self-referential system?" can't be answered from outside because there is no outside and no fundamental level.<br><br>


<h3>Ideological and Social Problems: choosing not to answer</h3>

<i>Quietism</i> is the attitude that certain questions are meaningless or not worth pursuing, so we don't try to answer them. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics takes this stance toward questions about unobserved quantum reality: if you can't measure it, don't ask about it. This is a methodological choice that declares certain questions out of bounds.<br><br>

<i>Positivism</i> restricts inquiry to observables, refusing to answer questions about theoretical entities. This philosophical stance says we should only talk about what can be directly observed or measured, making questions about underlying mechanisms or unobservable causes illegitimate by definition. We choose not to try because we view the rest as meaningless.<br><br>

<i>Informal philistinism</i> is the failure to use mathematics when it's necessary. Pre-Mendelian genetics like pangenesis theory used verbal descriptions and metaphors instead of mathematical models. The result was theories that couldn't make precise predictions or be rigorously tested. <br><br>

<i>Armchair philosophy</i> means using only apriori reasoning instead of empirical investigation. Molyneux's problem (whether a blind person given sight could recognise by vision what they'd previously known by touch) was debated for three centuries until someone actually collected the data. The answer was (in principle!) available all along through empirical investigation.<br><br>

<i>Basic research ethics</i> prevents us from answering certain questions when getting direct answers would be morally wrong. You can't do controlled experiments on children to answer the big questions about linguistic deprivation or social development. We rightly choose not to pursue it.<br><br>

<i>Disinformation, chilling effects, retaliation, and institutional capture</i> occur when powerful actors actively prevent questions from being answered. This might involve suppressing research, threatening researchers, manipulating publication, or taking over the institutions that should be investigating.<br><br>


<br><br><br>

You will have done really well if even <i>once</i> in your life you fail to answer a question for these reasons. Getting so far means you have avoided hundreds of punji traps, claymores, nerve gasses, madnesses.<br><br>
