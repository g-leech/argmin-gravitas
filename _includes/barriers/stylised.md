<p>What ways can we can fail to answer a question?</p>

<p>(I mean <em>necessarily</em> fail: actual barriers to knowledge, rather than skill issue hurdles. But of course contingent failures are much more common: “We didn’t ask the question in the first place”, or “We didn’t have the particular insight that would have allowed for productive research”, or “We didn’t manage to remove every cognitive bias”, or “Instrumentation is really hard”, or “We are not <a href="https://dynomight.net/arithmetic/#:~:text=How%20much%20would%20such%20a%20study%20cost%3F%20To%20figure%20this%20out%2C%20you%20will%20need%20three%20numbers%3A">rich enough</a> to run this study yet”, or “We worshipped the problem”.)</p>

<p>(I also mean fail <em>exactly</em>; there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness_of_approximation">often</a> excellent approximations, and we can often legitimately patch over tricky philosophical questions with our unanalysed tacit knowledge.)</p>

<h3 id="conceptual-problems-the-question-is-not-a-question">Conceptual problems (the question is not a question)</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>A malformed question or category error</em>: the question may ask for something which doesn’t make sense (e.g. “what colour is justice?”, or “Is sigmoid jealous of ReLU?”, or “Did these things happen at the same absolute time? What are the absolute coordinates of this event?”.) <!-- - Reference frame: we can't answer certain questions which ask for absolute answers because reality is relative here (e.g. Did these things happen at the same time? What are the coordinates of this event?) -->
    <ul>
      <li><em>Strong incommensurability</em>: the question doesn’t make sense because it mixes frameworks. (e.g. “What is the Einsteinian mass of phlogiston?”, or “What’s the wavefunction of this classical field?”)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Vagueness</em>: the question may fail to mean anything in particular. (e.g. “When exactly did you become an adult?”) <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5">5</a></li>
  <li><em>False assumptions</em>: we can’t answer it because, while it was clear and made sense, it was wrong from the start (e.g. “Have you stopped beating your wife?” or “Is personality based on nature or nurture?”. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">1</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="logical-problems-the-question-has-no-answer">Logical problems (the question has no answer)</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Antinomy</em>: it turns out that there is no answer because the question is circular or involves itself somehow (e.g. “Is this sentence false?”)</li>
  <li><em>Incompleteness</em> (“Show that Peano arithmetic is consistent with Peano arithmetic”.) and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem">undefinability</a></em> (e.g. “Is this sentence true in arithmetic?”) are about some proof answers being inaccessible inside systems powerful enough to be interesting and useful.</li>
  <li><em>Mathematical independence</em>: The question is neither provable nor disprovable with these axioms. (e.g. Is there a well-ordering of the reals? Is the continuum hypothesis true in ZFC? What is the value of <a href="https://www.ingo-blechschmidt.eu/assets/bachelor-thesis-undecidability-bb748.pdf">BB(748)</a> in ZFC?)</li>
  <li><em>Anthropic self-locating effects</em>: you can’t get at the answer because you couldn’t exist to observe it. (e.g. “What’s the probability I’m a Boltzmann brain?”, or “What’s the prior probability of observer-permitting universes?”)</li>
</ul>

<!-- What would physics look like if the cosmological constant made stars impossible? -->
<ul>
  <li><em>Non-uniqueness</em> is only a problem for questions which ask for the one true answer. (e.g. “What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_fixing#Gauge_freedom">the</a> electromagnetic potential at this point?”)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ontic-problems-the-answer-is-literally-inaccessible">Ontic problems (the answer is literally inaccessible)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Uncomputability</em>: we can’t answer it because no computer or mind can. (e.g. “Is this random?”, or “Does this Diophantine equation have integer solutions?” or “What’s the shortest Python program that outputs this file?” or “Can you write a program that checks if conjectures follow from these axioms?” Or you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem">asked</a> about the language the problem is in.) <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4">4</a>
<!-- - _Algorithmic randomness_: we can't answer the question because it needs a value of complexity, and these can't be had (e.g. "Is this random?") --></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Computational intractability</em>: we can’t answer it because it would take too long, including if we turned the universe into a computer. (What’s the best way to schedule these classes, avoiding all conflicts and respecting room capacities and lecturer availability? Or “I forgot my password; crack this file”.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Inapproximability</em>: we can’t even approximate the answer because it would still take too long. (e.g. “What’s the maximum clique size in this graph?”, “What’s a (log n)-approximation to the chromatic number?”)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-uncertainty/">Quantum indeterminacy</a></em>: there’s no answer because (maybe) physics is intrinsically random. (e.g. “When will this radium atom decay?”) <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3">3</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Physical constraints, speed limits and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-go_theorem">no-gos</a></em>: it can’t be answered in principle because of physics. (e.g. the answer is beyond the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_horizon">cosmological or particle horizon</a>, “what will happen in this galaxy 20 Gly away?” or “Can we measure this state in two bases?”, or “Make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_limit">perfectly</a> accurate interferometer”, or “What are the microstates of this black hole?.)
 <!-- Spacelike separation -->
<!-- Holographic saturation: The region's area limits information capacity [What are all microstates of this black hole interior?] -->
<!-- Light-sheet limitation: Information cannot exceed the covariant bound on null hypersurfaces [What's beyond the holographic screen?] --></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_(mathematics)">Mixing</a></em>: the answer is gone; we arrived too late; the system forgot the answer. (e.g. “What was the exact microstate of the gas in this room 1 hour ago?”, “What was the original state of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermalisation">thermalised</a> system?”)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Non-ergodicity</em>: the answer isn’t reachable because the system <em>doesn’t</em> mix. (e.g. “What equilibrium will this glassy system reach?”)
<!-- maybe "what state will this protein settle into?") --></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Measurement problems</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Disturbance</em> or <em>decoherence</em>: we can’t answer it because our instruments disturb the thing in question <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_measurement">too much</a>.</li>
      <li><em>Complementarity</em>: we can’t answer it because the answer was excluded by another question we asked first. (e.g. “where is this electron and how much momentum does it have?”)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

(e.g. Is spacetime fundamentally Lorentzian? Which interpretation of quantum mechanics is true? Why do physical constants look fine-tuned? What was the ancestral DNA sequence at some past generation?)</li>
  <li><em>Chaos</em>: we can’t answer it because we can’t measure the initial conditions well enough to predict large systems. (e.g. Where exactly will this double pendulum be in 100 Lyapunov times? What’s the weather like 3 months out?)
<!-- - _Vagueness_ (under epistemicism or contextualism) --></li>
  <li><em>Computational irreducibility</em>: getting the answer is inseparable from running the system, the question has no shorter answer than a full simulation (e.g. “What will this cellular automaton look like in 10^100 steps?”)</li>
  <li><em>Hidden variables</em>: we can’t ever observe the actual variables (e.g. What are the simultaneous values of σ_x and σ_z for this electron?)</li>
  <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_closure_(philosophy)">Cognitive closure</a></em>: we’re not smart enough to answer it. (e.g. “What is it like to be a bat?” It kinda looks like quantum gravity could also be an example.)</li>
  <li><em>Cognitive bias</em>: we’re not rational enough to answer it (e.g. “How biased am I?”)</li>

  <li><em>Observer effects</em>

      <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_action_(quantum)">Back action</a></em> (e.g. What’s the pre-measurement spin of this electron? What are the “real” observables in this quantum system? or “Measure the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Zeno_effect">full-speed</a> time evolution for this system”.)</li>
      <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory-ladenness">Theory-ladenness</a></em>:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Semantic theory-dependence</em>: Our observational vocabulary already presupposes theoretical commitments that prejudge the answer (e.g. What’s the rest mass of an electron, without assuming special relativity? What’s the ‘real’ temperature of the CMB independent of blackbody theory?)</li>
          <li><em>Perceptual theory-dependence</em>: Our perception is shaped by theoretical expectations, so we cannot see the answer “directly” (e.g. What do electron tracks really look like? What does this fMRI show before we apply the hemodynamic response model?)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/future-contingents/">Future contingents</a></em>: it doesn’t have an answer yet so we have to wait. (e.g. “What lottery numbers will win next week?”)<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2">2</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Hysteresis</em>: we can’t answer it because we weren’t there at the start and the system remembers.  (e.g. What’s the magnetic moment of this material at field strength H? When will this old rope snap? At what temperature will this water freeze?)
<!-- and non-Markovian processes --></p>
  </li>
  <li><em>Reflexivity and strange loops</em>: the thing in question is self-referential or causally dense, or it changes when answered, and so can’t be picked apart. (e.g. “What’s the best method for finding the best method?”; “Which level of description is fundamental in this self-referential system?”, “Which part of your mind is the real you?”.) See also <i>antinomy</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You could view some of these as not failure but just having a non-unique answer; we don’t fail to answer the question, just parametrise the observer and then answer. If non-uniqueness is a failure, it’s a happy one; it just means that you get too many answers and have the nicer problem of picking one.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>You will have done really well if even <em>once</em> in your life you fail to answer a question for these reasons. Getting so far means you have avoided hundreds of punji traps, claymores, nerve gasses, madnesses.</p>

        We could also pack in a very big one here, in principle: that all mathematics is only <a href="https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/103031/a-problem-i-noticed-with-if-then-ism-in-the-philosophy-of-mathematics"><i>conditionally</i> true</a> (i.e. conditional on the axioms involved) and so it's logically possible that we are making some false assumption and that the whole thing is actually inconsistent.

        Copenhagen: genuinely no answer exists before the measurement occurs → so interdeterminacy belongs in "logical problems"<br />

        Uncomputability is here in "ontic" because whether we could build a halting oracle actually depends on how physics works, not just the nature of logic. The physical Church-Turing thesis (that Turing machines exhaust actual computation) is an empirical claim. And it's not logically impossible for there to be weird shit like <a href="https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~jmanchak/otposigr.pdf">Malament-Hogarth spacetime</a> or <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/hypercomputation">analogue infinite precision</a>, so Turing uncomputability is not a logical limit.

        This is assuming indeterminacy theory or vagueness nihilism. Epistemicism ("there is an answer, we just can't know what it is") obviously belongs in "epistemic problems", as does contextualism ("the boundary exists but varies, and we may not know the relevant contextual features that let us pick it"). Degree theory/fuzzy logic ("reality itself admits degrees of truth; the boundaries are objectively fuzzy") is obviously ontic.

        Not getting into this here because they're not as fundamental but I will also mention:
