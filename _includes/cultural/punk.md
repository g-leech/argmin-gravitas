This ^ is one of the all-time great punk recordings. It has 5 chords (or rather one chord moved around a little) and was made by 16 year olds.<br><br><br>

Somehow this ^ is punk too. It represents punk as cheap freedom, and is by a band who practiced harder than you would believe.

<b>Critics</b>: Michael Azerrad, Daniel Sinker, Steve Albini, Robert Christgau, Pierro Scaruffi<br><br>

<b>Material conditions</b>: Ideal teenage culture. Parents don’t like it, it’s incredibly easy for you to participate, cool and edgy, easy uniform, expresses & ennobles alienation you were feeling anyway. DIY. Cheap! $5 gig tickets. Skill optional. Shocking on purpose. Alternative economics. Full lifestyle. Distortion covers mistakes.<br><br>

<b>Aims</b>: The expression of alienation. Easiest to express this as a critique of society, consumerism, war. <br><br>
