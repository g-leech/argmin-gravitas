This ^ is one of the all-time great punk recordings. It has 5 chords (or rather one chord moved around a little) and was made by 16 year olds.<br><br><br>

Somehow this ^ is punk too. They took punk to mean freedom (ha!), and got the real freedom afforded to the thrifty at least. By a band who practiced harder than you would believe.

You're probably not listening to it loud enough.

The bellowed intro "1-2-3-4!" was not an affectation, it was load-bearing to try and keep your amateur bandmates on the beat.

<b>Critics</b>: Michael Azerrad, Daniel Sinker, Steve Albini, Robert Christgau, Piero Scaruffi<br><br>

<b>Material conditions</b>: Ideal teenage culture. Parents don’t like it, it’s incredibly easy for you to participate, cool and edgy, easy uniform, expresses & ennobles alienation you were feeling anyway. DIY. Cheap! $5 gig tickets. Skill optional. Shocking on purpose. Alternative economics. Full lifestyle. Distortion covers mistakes.<br><br>

<b>Aims</b>: The expression of alienation. Easiest to express this as a critique of society, consumerism, war. <br><br>
