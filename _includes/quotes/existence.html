Each must seek and find happiness within himself. However, science and civilization have succeeded in eliminating influences disturbing happiness by overcoming the danger of lightning, national plagues, and illnesses of individuals in many cases. Furthermore, it has been made easier to journey over, and to come to know, our beautiful Earth, to imagine vividly the structure of the starred skies, and to glean dimly at least the eternal laws of Nature as a whole. In this way it [science] has allowed an ever greater development of the physical and mental powers of mankind and an ever-growing dominion over all the rest of Nature; and it has enabled those who found inner peace to enjoy it in a heightened unfolding of life and a greater perfection.” - Boltzmann -->


    <!-- One philosopher asked me whether I believed man was a machine. I replied, ‘Do you really think it makes any difference?’ He most earnestly replied, ‘Of course! To me it is the most important question in philosophy.’ I had the following afterthoughts: I imagine that if my friend had finally come to the conclusion that he were a machine, he would be infinitely crestfallen. I think he would think: ‘My God! How horrible! I am only a machine!’ But if I should find out I were a machine, my attitude would be totally different. I would say: ‘How amazing!

    		Igitur hominem accepit indiscretae opus imaginis atque in mundi positum meditullio sic est alloquutus: <br><br>

			"Nec certam sedem, nec propriam faciem, nec munus ullum peculiare tibi dedimus, o Adam, ut quam sedem, quam faciem, quae munera tute optaveris, ea, pro voto, pro tua sententia, habeas et possideas.<br><br>

			Definita caeteris natura intra praescriptas a nobis leges cohercetur. Tu, nullis angustiis cohercitus, pro tuo arbitrio, in cuius manu te posui, tibi illam prefinies. Medium te mundi posui, ut circumspiceres inde comodius quicquid est in mundo.<br><br>

			Nec te celestem neque terrenum, neque mortalem neque immortalem fecimus, ut tui ipsius quasi arbitrarius honorariusque plastes et fictor, in quam malueris tute formam effingas. Poteris in inferiora quae sunt bruta degenerare; poteris in superiora quae sunt divina ex tui animi sententia regenerari."<br><br>

			Cui datum id habere quod optat, id esse quod velit.

        <blockquote>Smeer maar er iets op als ge een blank doek U aan ziet staren met een zekere imbeciliteit...<br><br>
        Het leven op zich zelf keert aan een mensch altijd ook een oneindig niets zeggende, ontmoedigenden, hopeloos makenden blanken kant toe waar niets op staat, evenmin als op een blank schilderdoek.–<br><br>
        
        Maar hoe nietszeggend en ijdel, hoe dood het leven zich voor doe, de man van geloof, van energie, van warmte, en die iets weet, laat zich niet daardoor met een kluitje in ’t riet sturen. Hij grijpt er in en doet iets en knoopt daar aan vast, enfin breekt, “schendt”. Laat ze praten die koude theologen.
