	<li>Science involves the systematic use of evidence, observation, and third-party criticism to minimize self-interest, chance, delusion, and tribalism.</li>
	<li>Cultural anthropology recently explicitly rejected its prior identity as science. It treats science as an imposed Western particular rather than a liberating human universal.</li>
	<li>Studying human culture without the best methods often leads to research that is: (a) unfalsifiable, (b) noisy, (c) vulnerable to ideological capture, and (d) unable to distinguish insight from political convenience.</li>
	<li>Any political or advocacy movement (including protecting marginalized cultures) that abandons epistemic rigor eventually causes harm â€” oppressors *benefit* when there's no objective truth to their crimes.</li>
	<li>Adopting anti-scientific cultural anthropology won't adopt proven scientific approaches (like cultural evolution theory, quantitative methods, or interdisciplinary work with genetics and psychology) that could generate reliable knowledge about human societies.</li>
	<li>Individual anthropologists doing rigorous work remain valuable.</li>
