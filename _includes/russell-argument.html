	<li><li>Radical skepticism demands certainty - that we demonstrate the falsity of skeptical hypotheses with absolute certainty before we can claim knowledge of external world facts.</li>
	<li><li>This demand is impossible to meet without circular reasoning - we cannot justify our fundamental beliefs without already assuming them (norm 5We cannot have reason to reject a belief except on the ground of some other belief").</li>
	<li><li>Traditional epistemology's response - declaring this impossible demand "unreasonable" and therefore dismissible - fails because it commits a transparent fallacy: the inability to ground a position cannot itself be a compelling reason to believe it.</li>
	<li><li>However, we can legitimately retreat from claiming "knowledge" (in the strict, certainty-requiring sense) while retaining justified belief and rational inquiry, if we accept that: (a) scientific inference is reasonable despite being non-demonstrative, and (b) certain background assumptions (Russell's "postulates") must be accepted without demonstration as preconditions for any empirical investigation.</li>
	<li><li>These postulates (quasi-permanence, causal regularity, spatio-temporal continuity, etc.</li>) cannot themselves be justified by the standards they enable - they are neither empirical facts (since they enable empirical generalization), nor logical truths, nor a priori intuitions, but rather pragmatic prerequisites for inquiry.</li>
	<li>Knowledge in the traditional, certainty-based sense is unattainable.</li> But we can rationally maintain our beliefs by acknowledging them as justified-but-fallible, grounded in postulates we must accept not because we've proven them, but because we cannot proceed at all without them.</li> The skeptic wins the philosophical argument but loses its supposed practical force - we're entitled to our beliefs not because we've refuted skepticism, but because inquiry requires accepting some things without ultimate justification.</li>
