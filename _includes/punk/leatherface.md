	<h3>Personal note</h3>
	<div>
		I went 200 miles to see Leatherface as a teen. It turned out to be an over-18s gig, so I was bounced.
		<!--  -->
		The band heard about this within 10 minutes of it happening, and the singer came out to persuade the bouncer to let me in. It didn't work.<br><br>
		<!--  -->
		I listened to the start of the gig through a vent round the outside of the venue. Stubbs introed "<a href="{{dia}}">Dead Industrial Atmosphere</a>" with "CAN YA HEAR ME GAVIIIIN".
		<!--  -->
		Later, an audience member came out and changed clothes with me (pork pie hat, horrible leather waistcoast) and I walked past the bouncers.
		<!--  -->
		On seeing me inside, the band jumped up and down with glee.<br><br>
		There are other communities that do such things for strangers for free, including their high-status members. But it's a weekly occurrence for punks.<br><br>
		<!--  -->
		(A school night.)
