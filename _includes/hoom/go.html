Ornate and sickly - the title and lyrics are sports metaphors; there's a Bluebeard reference and other grisly things. The song is a charm for a man, one she's oddly subservient to (pardoning his violences and self-isolation). Masculinity viewed from outside.<br />
Much was made of the "kora vs harp duel" in this, but it is of course no such thing. There is a power struggle, but it's J&amp;B against B. (Each has their own melody.) Peering into your partner, coping with and treating the pieces you can see.<br><br>


"<i>We both want the very same thing -<br />
We are praying I am the one to save you</i>"
<br><br>


B's pet name here, wolf-spiders are solitary; the other pet names she gives him ("goose", "bluejay" and "magpie") are all species that mate for life.<br><br>

		@2:37 - Enter frantic, baroque kora part. (-&gt;@3:08) The Mekong runs through Vietnam. ...there's a horrible napalm image comes to me.<br />
		@3:08 - Nursing, talking "Grope your little nurse".<br />
		@4:07 - Bastard kora comes back.<br />
		@5:44 - Kora again dischords. Bluebeard's chamber; a room full of woman's teeth<br />
		@6:38 - Kora is hushed. A blessing, &amp; more unsettling kora -&gt; out.

There's only so close you can get. And with some - "mighty men" say - there's no piercing the veil.<br /><br />
