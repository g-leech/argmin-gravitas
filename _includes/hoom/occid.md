<div>

Minimal, solemn; song for dusk. Title means "the West" so, originally <i>point of sunset</i>: this is the end that "On A Good Day" sees coming at the start of the disc.<br /><br />

<blockquote>
	<i>something is moving, just out of frame<br />breaching slowly across the sea, one mast<br />- a flash, like the stinger of a bee -<br />to take you away, a swarming fleet is <br />gonna take you from me</i>

		@Whole piece progresses simply, but:<br />
		@1:13 - "<i>smoke me out of my hiding place</i>" (...that is, out of 'California'. )<br />
		@2:41 - "<i>Slow-heart, brace and aim</i>" ['at me']; next comes the order to fire.<br />
		@4:00 - Drums blunder in, two-beat.<br />
		@4:09 - Epiphany! (Callout this"Long-life" fucker)<br />
		@4:32 - What passes for ostentation in track 12 (slow jazz)
