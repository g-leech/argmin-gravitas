There's an incredible house remix lurking in here. Really; as TV-themey and ragtimey as it seems, I'm confident that there's a monster club choon here. Which is not to say that it doesn't function as the speakeasy blues romp it is. <br /><br />


We get fun, &amp; focus regained, after disc 2's predominating drunkness and <i>pain.</i> Still looking back, but empowered this time (<i>feel</i> the piano syncopating: matches track 4's giddy engine ostinato). J goes home again, and though there's still trouble ("<i>sadness beyond anger and beyond fear</i>") and boredom, this time it's hers.<br /><br />

		@5:55 - Did Jerry Lee ever sing about airports? Nvm; it's covered.

An upbeat RnB romp against love. Regretting having put herself through all that. As if the options were:


1. Freedom, &amp; Loneliness or 2. Stability, &amp; Entrapment
