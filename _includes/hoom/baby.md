<h3>6. Baby Birch (9:30)</h3>
<div>


Country hymnal to an unborn who won't be. (Birch twigs were the traditional material for building cribs.) Has, I think, only four chords. So different - a C&amp;W lilt, accelerating vocals and a haze of electric guitar. <br /><br />

<blockquote>
"<i>How about them engine breaks?
<br />
And, if I should die before I wake,
<br />
will you keep an eye on Baby Birch?<br />
Because I'd hate to see her<br />
make the same mistakes</i>."</blockquote>

<br />
Baby Birch herself is best seen as a <i>miscarried relationship.</i>I  adore the idea of child as embodiment of a relationship - though of course they're sometimes a <i>memento dolori</i>. J had assumed much, that they would have time, that they'd last. And she's not quite mourning - she imagines meeting the grown-up Baby Birch, in another "path" (possible world).

"<i>Dirty lake"</i>... The goose might have beenan exception to <i>HOOM</i>'s animals being unempathic - J calls the defensive, nesting mother "poor little cousin" - but then her offspring are dismissed as "dregs".<br /><br />


Ends on a violent nursery rhyme. There's some abortion-worthy images, but it doesn't cohere. This cooing mother makes her own furs; J skins a rabbit alive, which runs off "<i>as they're liable to do</i>". Her violence is desperate - trying to make it stop kicking, make it stay, make it hers. 
Rabbit is the baby is a relationship she had hoped would last and grow; instead, finally, she skins it and lets it run. An exorcism, instead ("be at peace and be gone").

Beginning the great rewrite, the great skin-shedding which getting out of love requires.<br /><br />
