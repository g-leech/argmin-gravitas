<h3>18. Does Not Suffice (6:44)</h3>
<div>

Ending on reasonable mourning; quiet fury. A fixin'-to-go song. Few autopsies but those of relationships are conducted with this bitterness. ("<i>like somethin caught on a barbed-wire fence</i>") After the gaudy whirl of "Kingfisher", this plays us on out: a bare but warm reprise of many melodies and thoughts of the last seventeen.<br /><br />

Focusses on beautiful things going away, out of sight, into storage. She, who has let herself <i>be</i> these clothes and finery at some points in the album. Vocals are delicate, but not sulking. He is made to "deny the evidence" of something, probably simply his lack of commitment. She pictures him as Lady Macbeth, even: "<i>scouring yourself red</i>". And it's her that is leaving. She's had enough: <i>it does not suffice to merely lie beside each other, as those who love each other do.</i> Dignity of sadness.<br /><br />

		@1:00 - Crushing admission.<br />
		@1:42 - "<i>sweet farewell</i>" eee!<br />
		@3:10 - The piano is more than it seems; she times it for certain phrases, slows the spread of certain chords.<br />
		@5:00 - Only here, after she has finished her lyrics (her packing-up) are other instruments allowed in. Strings enter, take her gently by the shoulders and steer her away; the band slowly overwhelm it all. Once again she "la la las" out.<br />
		@5:39 - Strange staccato chords, drums and electric violin (almost Amerindian)<br />
		@6:08 - Explosion is allowed to reverberate, decay. Faltering pedal.

"In California" is the named reprise; "It Does Not" has its middle chords (D-G-B-G) and switches IC's theme to a stripped-down, heavily struck piano. They share melodies: "<i>I have sown untidy furrows...</i>" and outro. But there's more returning than just that. Hear also:

<ul>
	<li>"Baby Birch": same chords (D-G-B-G).</li>
	<li>"You and Me, Bess": the album's other "la la la"s.</li>
	<li>"No Provenance": "bales" and "burn" point back to it; the Farm Couple.</li>
	<li>"Good Intentions"</li>
	<li>And "Easy" above all - she is removing from the house "<i>everything that could remind you of how easy I was not</i>" - this last song is the final collapse of the promising from the first track. The best laid plan, awry.</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

Life sort of goes on.
