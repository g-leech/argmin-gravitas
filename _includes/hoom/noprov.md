<h3>5. No Provenance (6:25)</h3>
<div>

Title is "out of nowhere". But no <i>providence</i> either - as in, no guarantee about the future. Probably the most complex piece - 16 or 17 chords, and it modulates four times. Following the last track's surrender to love (as if the car goes over the cliff)...<br /><br />


"<i>Allelu, allelu, I have died happy</i>".
<br /><br />
But there's trouble yet. They go for a walk; Rome collapses in their absence! (The farm, unguarded empire of their love...) He sees it coming.<br />

Lying together in a field, they're set upon by an "etiolated", skittish little horse. (J: her doubt and discontentment.) It tries to escape, but the gate holds fast. Neither J nor her partner have much sympathy for the struggling animal (as usual, we resent our doubts). He accepts the horse's distress, just "nodding sadly". She wonders what he knows, what he's planned, his signed-and-sealed 'arrangement with Fate'. Ain't convinced. J asks to be led - she can't find her own way - back to the farm, to resume the certainty of his arms.<br /><br />


She calls him Johnny Appleseed, the folk hero - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Appleseed#Attitudes_towards_animals">horse-kind - but a committed bachelor too</a>.<br /><br />
