<h3>15. Autumn (8:01)</h3>
<div>

Crash, again! Alone and <i>lonesome</i>. She can barely raise her head. At home, waiting and taking stock of a shit run of luck ("<i>Snowbound by thoughts of him</i>"). Home now populated by ghosts and unsympathetic weather. There's excellent use of the horns again here, as well as a restrained string section. <br /><br />


"<i>I'll winter here, wait for a sign / To cast myself out, over the water, / riven like a wishbone.</i>"<br /><br />


Tearing herself in half, here - wanting to stay and also to go back to him. It's not clear which half of her is the lucky half, which the useless bit of the chicken's collar. <br /><br />


Compare the rain in "Esme" -<br />
"<i>It's a beautiful town, with the rain coming down</i>"<br />
- with, here:<br />
"<i>rain...lists down on the gossiping lawns, saying tsk, tsk, tsk.</i>" 
<br /><br />

	<th class="tg-031e">
		@1:28 - optimism, like a break in the clouds<br />
		@3:31 - mind-rhyme - "<i>no control / </i>over my heart, over my mind."<br />
		@3:58 - UP! This time the optimism clears the bastard sky.<br />
		@4:58 - song suddenly bursts (jarring key change). We veer offroad.<br />
		@5:18 - bursts again<br />
		@5:39 - bursts again<br />
		@6:30 - "<i>I loved them all, one by one</i>" (as Lola with her flies)<br />
		@7:21 - Crashing, scale down. -&gt; Wry flourish.
