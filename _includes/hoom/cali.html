<h3>9. In California (8:01)</h3>
<div>

Personal highlight: an ode to retreating home. (More delusion, but what sweet and self-assured lies they are!) Home as sanctuary, running from the breakup. "Time", nostalgia, "sometimes", time, time. The tick-tock harp marks structure - the main (theme) section builds up in three runs - sometimes, sometimes, sometimes. Running metaphor of herself as an uprooted and difficult plant.<br /><br />

Can't shake him. J pretends to have everything just as she wants: 'home'. She's learning it properly for the first time, even. Tells him to leave her alone - and looks forward to him disobeying. She has "<i>sown untidy furrows across her soul</i>", been "pulling artlessly with fool commands" in moving on abruptly and categorically. Ain't working.<br /><br />

Two reasons you ignore a thing: either it's not important or you wish it weren't.<br /><br />

Ends on the admission; "<i>it has half ruined me to be hanging around here...I am native to it, but I'm overgrown.</i>" Where do you go when home isn't home anymore?<br /><br />

A magnificent easter egg: the first 8 tracks total 53 minutes - then here, just before the 60min mark she cries "<i>Like a little clock that trembles on the edge of the hour / Only ever calling out 'cuckoo! cuckoo!'.</i>"
