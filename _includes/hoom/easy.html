<h3>1. Easy (6:01)</h3>
<div>
	Album makes its landing approach, voice borne down by violins.<br><br>

Heavy with gospel tones - "there's a river made of light"; "you must not fear / speak my name and I appear" - and a properly obsessive love, but they're masked by the jaunty piano and the witty backing strings, drums, and winds.<br><br>


Title's a shushing; think whispering to a jittery horse (your partner). She taunts and pleads for love, promises him all sorts. She's trying, desperately <i>trying</i>...to show that it will be easy. She feels "tested", he's "pained". Her man is compared unfavourably to a frog, who has stamina, goes courting all day.<br><br>


I love the little Wittgenstein line at the end of the first verse; "<i>we are blessed and sustained by what is not said</i>", but it is terrible self-delusion.

	@2:09 - left alone again<br />
	@3:14 - lovely flute licks<br />
	@3:22 - Glory horns distract from <b>terrifying</b> telling B to "give your life."<br />
	@3:33 - back down<br />
	@4:47 - Reset; she calms her pleas.<br />
	@5:30 - Jaunty, lazy horns and killer strings, out.

The Bloody Mary reference is dark beyond its namesake, too: like some ghost, she only feels real when she has his attention - "<i>I am barely here... speak my name and I appear.</i>"
