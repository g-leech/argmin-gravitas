<h3>16. Ribbon Bows (6:10)</h3>
<div>

Far more pragmatic - "<i>I could use someone like you around". Destitute again, though! Dissatisfying hedonism, one way out of Autumn's terrible doldrum. (Another one where the music is deceptively positive: listen cloze, now. Shares the high country vocal with "Baby Birch" and "Esme".)<br />
J goes to a dog pound, picks up an "old hangdog" (Kingfisher? Long-life?) and makes do. Rolls in bad habits and lost-and-lorn revelry.
<br /><br />

Compare "<i>For Pete's sake, what you have told me, I cannot erase!"<br />
with <i>Easy</i>'s "<i>Tell me your worries, I want to be told."

		@1:28 - nice mandolin frill<br />

		@4:34 - Vaguely Celtic lick there

"Alone at last". Self-referring at the end, like Esme, but here it's the decidedly malign - "could swear the night makes a motion to claim me, around that second verse..."<br /><br />


"<i>Carrying on, whooping it up til the early morn<br />Lost and lorn among the madding revelry<br />Sure, I can pass / honey, I can pass<br />Particularly when I start / To tip my glass"
	<br /><br />
	
(cf "Atlantis", by Auden)<br />
"Behave absurdly enough<br />
To pass for one of The Boys,<br />
At least appearing to love<br />
Hard liquor, horseplay and noise."
