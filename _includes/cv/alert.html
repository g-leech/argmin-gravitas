          Partial failure to launch. Founder of the Active Longtermist Emergency Response Team, a pop-up think tank filling gaps in state capacity. Ran initial strategy, fundraising, executive search, board selection, external collaborations, recruiting. Shuttered and spent no money: passed funding to Dendritic; passed strategy to Rethink.
