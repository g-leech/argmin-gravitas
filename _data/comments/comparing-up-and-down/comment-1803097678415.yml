message: 'When our four-year-old daughter had leukemia, my wife and I coined a saying: "No matter how bad things are, they can always get worse." It may sound like a pessimistic point of view, but to us it was a way to cope. It reminded us to be grateful for what we had (comparing down), not in despair for what we were suffering (comparing up).<br><br>Our daughter survived and is now a mother and a professional counselor for medically challenged children.'
