People are using CBD oil to ease their chronic pain, and relieve symptoms of conditions ranging from arthritis to depression. Unlike its close cousin, psychoactive cannabis (‘marijuana’), CBD oil won’t make you feel high — but many users report significant relief of their symptoms. Even the World Health Organization declared CBD oil safe and worthy of deeper research. \r\n \r\nAt the same time, record-breaking popularity and an unregulated industry make it hard to separate quality CBD oil from snake oil. Especially if you’re new to using hemp extracts, choosing can be confusing. That’s where Ministry of Hemp can help. We’ve reviewed dozens of products and selected the best CBD oil tinctures available online today. \r\n \r\nIn this detailed roundup, we’ll explain more about how to select the right CBD for your needs, and then share the top 12 CBD oil brands for sale online. Read on to see our complete reviews! \r\n \r\nHOW TO PICK THE BEST CBD OIL TINCTURE FOR YOU \r\nWe believe all the products in this article are high-quality, effective supplements. Even so, it can be confusing to know where to start. Fortunately, there’s some simple advice that you can use to pick the best CBD oil tincture for your needs. \r\n \r\nA man in a suit jacket and dress shirt takes a tincture. It can be hard to pick the best CBD oil tinctures for your needs, but considering a few key factors can help you make a decision. \r\nIt can be hard to pick the best CBD oil tinctures for your needs, but considering a few key factors can help you make a decision. \r\n \r\nSome people don’t mind, or even enjoy the natural taste of hemp oil tinctures. For those who are bothered by the distinctive herbal taste of hemp extract, a flavored CBD oil tincture may be better. We’ve selected a variety of both flavored and unflavored CBD oil tinctures in this roundup, and many of the brands selected offer multiple options. If you still can’t stand the flavor of CBD tincture, consider another option like CBD gummies or capsules. Topical CBD is another popular choice, especially if you’re treating body aches or certain skin problems. \r\n \r\nStrength is also an extremely important consideration. Beginners may find that it’s easier to control dosage using a lower strength tincture. On the other hand, experienced CBD consumers know that high strength tinctures are more cost effective. Although stronger tinctures cost more, you get more CBD oil and other beneficial cannabinoids in each drop. Most CBD brands offer more than one option for strength. \r\n \r\nFinally, most of the products below simply contain hemp oil extract, mixed with a neutral carrier oil like hemp seed oil or coconut oil. While hemp seed oil is packed with nutrition, CBD brands are beginning to offer supplements with added ingredients that may offer additional benefits. We’ve included the complete ingredients of every product. Be sure to avoid any known allergies and investigate the pros and cons of any additional ingredients. \r\n \r\nOverall, we recommend trying a variety of options until you find the best one for you. Begin to familiarize yourself with the different brands and what makes each one unique. \r\n \r\nIf you’re buying a CBD product that isn’t on this list, make sure to follow the same criteria we used in picking the products in this roundup. We outline how we selected these tinctures below. \r\n \r\nOUR REVIEW CRITERIA: HOW WE SELECTED THE BEST CBD OIL TINCTURES \r\nWhile many vendors offer high-quality CBD oil, there was simply no way to review every CBD oil. Inevitably, we had to pick and choose and some great hemp companies were left off this list. \r\n \r\nWe focused primarily on larger, well-established brands with reliable, well-designed websites and rock-solid customer service. Every brand featured here makes it easy to get information about their products and easy to find help if you have questions or a problem. \r\n \r\nSimilarly, transparency is one of our top concerns when it comes to selecting the best CBD oil tinctures. Every product below is clearly labeled, so you can easily understand how much CBD oil / full spectrum hemp extract is in each bottle. You can also easily find the complete ingredients on the bottle, packaging or the company’s website. These brands are also open about where they source their hemp. \r\n \r\nA collection of CBD oil tinctures along with hemp buds and a beaker of CBD oil. Out of hundreds of products available online, we picked the 12 best CBD oil tinctures and reviewed each one. \r\nOut of hundreds of products available online, we picked the 12 best CBD oil tinctures and reviewed each one. \r\n \r\nEvery CBD product should make third-party lab results available, either online, in their packaging, or by request. At minimum, each tincture here offers lab results showing the levels of cannabinoids like CBD and THC, while others offer additional tests. The more information available to consumers the better. At the same time, we admit it isn’t always easy for newcomers to interpret these lab tests. \r\n \r\nFinally, in general, we almost always recommend full spectrum tinctures over supplements made from isolates (extracts of CBD alone). Full-spectrum or whole plant tinctures take advantage of the ‘entourage effect’ that comes from combining all the naturally occurring chemicals found in the hemp plant. Isolates are great for cooking with CBD or consumers that are especially sensitive to the taste of hemp extract, but some research suggests they may be less effective for certain uses than full spectrum extracts. All but two of the brands below are made from full spectrum hemp, and the exceptions are clearly noted. \r\n \r\nAfter careful review, we believe these are the best CBD oil tinctures online. Since these are all top-quality CBD tinctures, they are not ranked in any particular order. \r\n \r\nPopulum Premium Hemp Oil, Orange flavor \r\nAnanda Hemp Zero THC Tincture \r\nCW Hemp Extract Oil, Mint Chocolate flavor \r\nElixinol Respira CBD Oil, Grape Mint flavor \r\nBluebird Botanicals Hemp Signature Blend, Hemp Extract plus Black Seed Oil \r\nPalmetto Harmony Full Spectrum Hemp Oil \r\nReceptra Naturals Plus Hemp CBD Oil, Fresh Berry flavor \r\nNuLeaf Naturals Full Spectrum CBD Oil \r\nAmbary Gardens Full Spectrum Daily CBD Hemp Extract \r\nRestorative Botanicals Restore CALM Hemp Oil Supplement, Spice flavor \r\nLazarus Naturals Tropical High Potency Tincture, Tropical flavor, Isolate-based \r\nMedterra MedOil CBD Tincture, Isolate-based \r\nClick above or continue reading for our complete review of each brand. \r\n \r\nMinistry of Hemp received free products from many of these companies in return for writing this review. We may receive a percentage of sales if you buy products from some of the brands below.
