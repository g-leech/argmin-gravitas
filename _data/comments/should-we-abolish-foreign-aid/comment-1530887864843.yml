We had opportunities that we didn't enough from, as simple as that.\"\r\nThe cuts were made two days after Jackson made his preseason debut in a 43-19 preseason win over Pittsburgh on Saturday.\r\n\"It's out of my control, so it's tough for me to worry about those kinds of things,\" the rookie seventh-round pick from Northwestern said. \"I've had fun going out and playing when I have, so I'm just thankful to get a chance.\""
