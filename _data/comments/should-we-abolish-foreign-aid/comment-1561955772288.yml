message: "I am 64 years old generally in Good health,Gymming daily for 40 mins. I am type 2 Diabetic,maintain a good diet etc. Since last year I am totally impotent and now Viagra also does not help much. I have been advised by one  Doctor to use Testosterone Gel and HGH injection. The other doctor told me to go in for Testosterone injection . I am a bit confused and scared to try these options. \r\nSo I would like the opinions of Good samaritans  who have practical experience with any of the above treatment? Does someone try  \r\n<a href=https://petaluma.therapy-hgh.com>Petaluma HGH Injections</a>? Secondly what precautions and side effects I can expect from this line of action. \r\nPlease serious advisors will be  appreciated . \r\nTrollers are also welcome"
