message: "Lived there for three years, 2006-2009. Most vivid memory is sitting in a park near Union Street with my lunch at 12:00 noon on a crisp December day. The sky was vibrant blue, not a cloud anywhere. But I was sitting in the shade because the sun was so low that it was blocked by the surrounding buildings. And the seagulls seemed to be slowly creeping closer, gathering to attack my sandwich.<br><br><b>Gavin: Thanks Tim! Were you an oilman?</b><br><br>Tim: I was. Same as all the other Americans in Aberdeen! Now comfortably retired and occasionally enjoying a wee dram of my favorite Scottish product!"
