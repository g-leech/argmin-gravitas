message: "Great review, and I really like your writing style.<br><br>My only issue is this type of cynicism when it comes up: 'She makes much of Spotify lying in corporate press releases (e.g. that their intention was to “save music”, e.g. that it was a democratisation). I suppose some of you need to be told about the ontological status of Santa Claus too.'<br><br>I finally got around to believing that bad things are bad, and should be called out for being so even when they're the norm. Also the logic of the cynicism can be applied to almost anything, even against itself.<br><br>'Oh, you're annoyed the left-leaning writer is upset at corporate hypocrisy? I suppose you need to be told about the ontological status of Santa Claus too.'"
