message: "<blockquote>'[Germans] referred to as Indo-Germanic people'.</blockquote> This is not intended as an insult. German linguists themselves call the language family 'indo-Germanic', because the two edges of the family on the map are India and England (a Germanic language). Renaming it to 'Indo-European' was fueled by anti-German sentiment after the world wars. A mistake in my opinion, as there's several languages in Europe that are not Indo-European."
